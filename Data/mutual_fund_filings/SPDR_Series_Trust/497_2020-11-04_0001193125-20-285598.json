You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.25%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.25%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $26        $80    $141     $318  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 17%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the Dow\nJones U.S. Select REIT\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is designed\nto provide a measure\nof real estate\nsecurities that serve\nas proxies for direct\nreal estate investing,\nin part by excluding\nsecurities whose value\nis not always closely\ntied to the value of\nthe underlying real\nestate. The reason for\nthe exclusions is that\nperformance of such\nsecurities may be\ndriven by factors\nother than the value\nof real estate. The\nIndex is a market\ncapitalization\nweighted index of\npublicly traded real\nestate investment\ntrusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) and\nis comprised of\ncompanies whose\ncharters are the\nequity ownership and\noperation of\ncommercial and/or\nresidential real\nestate and which\noperate under the REIT\nAct of 1960. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na company must be both\nan equity owner and\noperator of commercial\nand/or residential\nreal estate.\nBusinesses excluded\nfrom the Index\ninclude: those\nclassified under the\nDow Jones REIT/RESI\nIndustry\nClassification\nHierarchy as\n\u201cSpecialty\u201d ( i.e.,\nREIT types that cannot\nbe easily classified\nwithin the Hierarchy,\nincluding net-lease\nREITs, timber REITs,\nrailroad REITs and\ntower REITs), hybrid\nREITS, mortgage REITs,\nreal estate finance\ncompanies, mortgage\nbrokers and bankers,\ncommercial and\nresidential real\nestate brokers and\nestate agents, home\nbuilders, large\nlandowners and\nsubdividers of\nunimproved land, as\nwell as companies that\nhave more than 25% of\ntheir assets in direct\nmortgage investments.\nA company must have a\nminimum float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\nof at least $200\nmillion at the time of\nits inclusion, and at\nleast 75% of the\ncompany's total\nrevenue must be\nderived from the\nownership and\noperation of real\nestate assets. A stock\nmust have a median\ndaily value traded of\nat least $5 million\nfor the three-months\nprior to the\nrebalancing reference\ndate. The Index is\ngenerally rebalanced\nquarterly, and returns\nare calculated on a\nbuy and hold basis\nexcept as necessary to\nreflect the occasional\noccurrence of Index\nchanges in the middle\nof the month. Each\nREIT in the Index is\nweighted by its float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization. That\nis, each security is\nweighted to reflect\nthe attainable market\ncapitalization of the\nsecurity which\nreflects that portion\nof securities shares\nthat are accessible to\ninvestors. The Index\nis priced daily and is\na total return (price\nand income) benchmark.\nAs of July 31, 2020,\nthe Index comprised\n116 REITs. The Index\nis sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC\n(the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with\nthe Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines\nthe composition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Real Estate\nSector Risk: An\ninvestment in a real\nproperty company may\nbe subject to risks\nsimilar to those\nassociated with direct\nownership of real\nestate, including, by\nway of example, the\npossibility of\ndeclines in the value\nof real estate, losses\nfrom casualty or\ncondemnation, and\nchanges in local and\ngeneral economic\nconditions, supply and\ndemand, interest\nrates, environmental\nliability, zoning\nlaws, regulatory\nlimitations on rents,\nproperty taxes, and\noperating expenses.\nSome real property\ncompanies have limited\ndiversification\nbecause they invest in\na limited number of\nproperties, a narrow\ngeographic area, or a\nsingle type of\nproperty. REIT Risk:\nReal estate investment\ntrusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) are\nsubject to the risks\nassociated with\ninvesting in the\nsecurities of real\nproperty companies. In\nparticular, REITs may\nbe affected by changes\nin the values of the\nunderlying properties\nthat they own or\noperate. Further,\nREITs are dependent\nupon specialized\nmanagement skil ls , 2\n\nTable of Contents\n\nand their investments\nmay be concentrated in\nrelatively few\nproperties, or in a\nsmall geographic area\nor a single property\ntype. REITs are also\nsubject to heavy cash\nflow dependency and,\nas a result, are\nparticularly reliant\non the proper\nfunctioning of capital\nmarkets. A variety of\neconomic and other\nfactors may adversely\naffect a lessee's\nability to meet its\nobligations to a REIT.\nIn the event of a\ndefault by a lessee,\nthe REIT may\nexperience delays in\nenforcing its rights\nas a lessor and may\nincur substantial\ncosts associated in\nprotecting its\ninvestments. In\naddition, a REIT could\nfail to qualify for\nfavorable regulatory\ntreatment. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more 3 Table\nof Contents\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Daniel TenPas. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Daniel TenPas,\nCFA, is a Principal of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2010. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary 4 Table of\nContents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Some distributions may be\ntreated as a return of capital for tax\npurposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund\nShares through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), the\nAdviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, including educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 5\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeFactSet Innovative Technology ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF  \n  (the                                        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment         \n  results that,                               \n  before fees and expenses, correspond        \n  generally to                                \n  the total return performance of the         \n  FactSet                                     \n  Innovative Technology Index.                \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 35%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nFactSet Innovative\nTechnology Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index (including\ncommon stock,\npreferred stock,\ndepositary receipts\nand shares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nits Index. The Index\nis designed to\nrepresent the\nperformance of\nU.S.-listed stock and\nAmerican Depository\nReceipts (\u201cADRs\u201d) of\nTechnology companies\nand Technology-related\ncompanies (including\nElectronic Media\ncompanies) within the\nmost innovative\nsegments of the\nTechnology sector and\nElectronic Media sub-\nsector of the Media\nsector, as defined by\nFactSet Research\nSystems, Inc.\n(\u201cFactSet\u201d or the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The\nIndex Provider\nconsiders the most\ninnovative segments of\nthe Technology sector\nand Electronic Media\nsub-sector to be those\nwith the highest\nrevenue growth and\nbelieves that these\ncompanies are often\ninvolved in cutting\nedge research,\ninnovative product and\nservice development,\ndisruptive business\nmodels, or a\ncombination of these\nactivities. In\naddition to\ntraditional Technology\ncompanies, Electronic\nMedia companies are\nincluded in the Index\nbecause of their core\nfocus on technology\nand the integral role\ntechnology plays in\ndetermining how such\ncompanies operate,\ninnovate and compete\nwithin their industry.\nFactSet defines the\nTechnology sector to\ninclude Information\nTechnology Services\nproviders, Hardware\nmanufacturers,\nSoftware\nmanufacturers,\nElectronic Components\nmanufacturers, and\nManufacturing\nEquipment and Services\nproviders. FactSet\ndefines the Electronic\nMedia sub-sector to\ninclude companies that\nproduce media content\nin digital format and\ndeliver, distribute\nand monetize their\ncontent via an\nelectronic medium such\nas the Internet.\nFactSet sector\ndeterminations are\nbased on a\ncomprehensive,\nstructured taxonomy\ndesigned to seek to\noffer precise industry\nclassification of\nglobal companies\naccording to the\nproducts and services\nsold by such companies\n(the \u201cFactSet Revere\nHierarchy\u201d). The\nFactSet Revere\nHierarchy reflects a\nvariable depth\nstructure that, with\nrespect to the Index,\nconsists of twelve\nlevels of increasingly\nspecialized Technology\nor Electronic Media\nsub-sectors.\nTechnology and\nelectronic media\ncompanies are\nclassified or mapped\nto the sub-sectors\nfrom which they each\nderive 50% or more of\ntheir respective\nrevenues. A company\nwill be eligible for\ninclusion in the Index\nif it satisfies the\nfollowing criteria:\n(i) is mapped to a\nTechnology or\nElectronic Media sub-\nsector at the fourth\nlevel or lower (levels\nfour through twelve)\nin the FactSet Revere\nHierarchy; (ii) is\nmapped to a sub-sector\nin the top quartile of\nFactSet's composite\nrevenue growth scoring\nsystem for the\nTechnology sector or\nElectronic Media sub-\nsector (the \u201crevenue\ngrowth scoring\nsystem\u201d); (iii) has a\nmarket capitalization\nof shares publicly\navailable to investors\n(i.e., a \u201cfloat-\nadjusted\u201d market\ncapitalization) above\n$500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) above\n90% or have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization above\n$400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) above\n150%; (iv) is a\nU.S.-listed stock or\nADR; and (v) has not\nhad an initial public\noffering of shares\nwithin three months of\nthe Review Selection\nDay (defined below).\nThe Index is equal-\nweighted to ensure\nthat each of its\ncomponent securities\nis represented in\napproximate equal\ndollar value at each\nreconstitution. The\nIndex is capped at a\nmaximum of 100\nconstituent\nsecurities. If there\nare fewer than 50\nstocks suitable for\ninclusion based on the\neligibility criteria,\nstocks mapped to the\nnext highest-ranked\nquartile of sub-\nsectors would be added\nuntil the minimum\nnumber of Index\nconstituents is met.\nTo ensure that each\ncomponent stock\ncontinues to represent\napproximate equal\nmarket value in the\nIndex, adjustments, if\nnecessary, are made\nannually after the\nclose of trading on\nthe third Friday of\nDecember (the\n\u201cReconstitution Day\u201d)\nbased on information\nas of the last\nbusiness day two weeks\nbefore the\nReconstitution Day\n(the \u201cReview Selection\nDay\u201d). As of July 31,\n2020, the Index was\ncomprised of 98\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by FactSet\n(the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with\nthe Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines\nthe composition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. 7\nTable of Contents\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nElectronic Media\nCompanies Risk:\nElectronic media\ncompanies create, own,\nan ddistribute various\nforms of technology-\nbased visual, audio,\nand interactive\ncontent, as well as\ninformation databases\nthat they sell or\nlease to others.\nElectronic media\ncompanies can be\nadversely affected by,\namong other things,\nchanges in government\nregulation, intense\ncompetition,\ndependency on patent\nprotection, and rapid\nobsolescence of\nproducts and services\ndue to product\ncompatibility or\nchanging consumer\npreferences.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nare generally subject\nto the same risks as\ntheir underlying\nsecurities, including\npolitical, regulatory,\nand economic risks.\nThere may be less\ninformation publicly\navailable about a\nnon-U.S. entity that\nissues the underlying\nsecurities than about\na U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities\nare not subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\nliquidity risks;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. 8 Table\nof Contents\n\nGrowth Stock Risk: The\nprices of growth\nstocks may be based\nlargely on\nexpectations of future\nearnings, and their\nprices can decline\nrapidly and\nsignificantly in\nreaction to negative\nnews. Growth stocks\nmay underperform value\nstocks and stocks in\nother broad style\ncategories (and the\nstock market as a\nwhole) over any period\nof time and may shift\nin and out of favor\nwith investors\ngenerally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on\nchanges in market,\neconomic, and other\nfactors. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Michael Finocchi. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Michael\nFinocchi is a Principal of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same.

These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 8%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of The\nGlobal Dow (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n11\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is made up\nof approximately 150\ncompanies from around\nthe world. The\ncompanies are selected\nnot just based on size\nand reputation, but\nalso on their\nimportance in the\nglobal economy. The\nIndex has been\ndesigned to cover both\ndeveloped and emerging\ncountries. The Index\nis equal weighted and\nwill be reset to equal\nweights annually each\nSeptember. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 152 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain 12 Table of\nContents on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe\ncounterparty.Currency\nRisk: The value of the\nFund's assets may be\naffected favorably or\nunfavorably by\ncurrency exchange\nrates, currency\nexchange control\nregulations, and\ndelays, restrictions\nor prohibitions on the\nrepatriation of\nforeign currencies.\nForeign currency\nexchange rates may\nhave significant\nvolatility, and\nchanges in the values\nof foreign currencies\nagainst the U.S.\ndollar may result in\nsubstantial declines\nin the values of the\nFund's assets\ndenominated in foreign\ncurrencies. Depositary\nReceipts Risk:\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser.Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible\ntrade barriers,\ncurrency transfer\nrestrictions, a more\nlimited number of\npotential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 13 Table of\nContents Liquidity\nRisk: Lack of a ready\nmarket or restrictions\non resale may limit\nthe ability of the\nFund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nma ybe more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\n\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 12.45% ( Q3,\n2010)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 18.76% ( Q3,\n2011)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was -7.11%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective May 2, 2011 (the \u201cBenchmark\nIndex Change Date\u201d), the Fund's benchmark\nindex changed from the Dow Jones Global Titans\nIndex (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to The\nGlobal Dow, consistent with a change in the\nFund's principal investment strategy to track\nthe performance of the current index.\nPerformance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark\nIndex Change Date is therefore based on the\nFund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index. 14 Table of Contents\n                                              \n                OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return        22.04%   7.90%      7.22%     \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      21.33%   7.37%      6.70%     \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  13.71%   6.20%      5.79%     \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  1             21.95%   7.86%      7.23%     \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction     31.49%   11.70%     13.56%    \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.\n\nPortfolio Managers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Michael Feehily, Karl Schneider\nand Kathleen Morgan.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n15 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeMSCI USA StrategicFactors SMETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactorsSM ETF    \n  (the                                        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment         \n  results that,                               \n  before fees and expenses, correspond        \n  generally to                                \n  the total return performance of an index    \n  based                                       \n  upon the U.S. equity market.                \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 21% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the MSCI\nUSA Factor Mix A-Series\nCapped Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 16\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe equity market\nperformance of large-\nand mid-cap companies\nacross the U.S. equity\nmarket. It aims to\nrepresent the\nperformance of a\ncombination of three\nfactors: value,\nquality, and low\nvolatility. The Index\nis an equal weighted\ncombination of the\nfollowing three MSCI\nFactor Indices in a\nsingle composite index:\nthe MSCI USA Value\nWeighted Index, the\nMSCI USA Quality Index,\nand the MSCI USA\nMinimum Volatility\nIndex (each, a\n\u201cComponent Index\u201d). If\nthe MSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Index is not\navailable due to the\nconcentrated nature of\nits underlying parent\nindex (for example, in\nthe event of a low\nnumber of stocks or\nwhere a relatively few\nnumber of constituents\nconstitutes a large\nproportion of index\nweight), the MSCI USA\nMinimum Volatility\nIndex is replaced with\nthe MSCI USA Risk\nWeighted Index (if used\nto replace the MSCI USA\nMinimum Volatility\nIndex, also a\n\u201cComponent Index\u201d) and\nthe Index is an equal\nweighted combination of\nthe MSCI USA Value\nWeighted Index, the\nMSCI USA Quality Index\nand the MSCI USA Risk\nWeighted Index. The\nIndex Provider (defined\nbelow) determines if\nsuch replacement is\nnecessary and reviews\nthe MSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Index for\nviability on a regular\nbasis. The MSCI USA\nValue Weighted Index\nincludes publicly-\ntraded companies\ndomiciled in the U.S.,\nweighted to emphasize\nstocks with lower\nvaluations, by giving\nhigher index weight to\nstocks with higher\nvalues of fundamental\nvariables such as\nsales, earnings, cash\nearnings and book\nvalue. The MSCI USA\nQuality Index includes\npublicly-traded\ncompanies domiciled in\nthe U.S., weighted to\nemphasize stocks with\nhistorically high\nreturn on equity,\nstable year-over-year\nearnings growth, and\nlow financial leverage.\nThe MSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Index aims\nto reflect the\nperformance\ncharacteristics of a\nminimum variance\nstrategy applied to\npublicly-traded\ncompanies domiciled in\nthe U.S. and is\nweighted to provide the\nlowest absolute risk\nwithin a given set of\nconstraints. The MSCI\nUSA Risk Weighted Index\nincludes publicly-\ntraded companies\ndomiciled in the U.S.,\nand reweights the\nconstituents so that\nstocks with lower\nvolatility, measured as\nthe weekly return\nvariance over the prior\nthree years, are given\nhigher index weight.\nEach Component Index is\nattributed equal weight\n(1/3) at each\nrebalancing. All\nconstituents of each\nComponent Index are\nincluded in the Index.\nThe weight of each\nsecurity in the Index\nis determined based on\n1) the security's\nweight in each\nunderlying Component\nIndex; and 2) the\nweight of each\nunderlying Component\nIndex in the Index. The\nIndex is then subject\nto the MSCI A-Series\nIndex Methodology. The\nMSCI A-Series Index\nMethodology first seeks\nto ensure the Index\nincludes at least 25\nconstituents. In the\nevent the Index does\nnot contain at least 25\nconstituents, the Index\nis supplemented by\nincluding constituents\nof the MSCI USA Small\nCap Index, selected in\ndecreasing order based\non full market\ncapitalization, until\nthe target of 25\nconstituents is\nreached. The MSCI\nA-Series Index\nMethodology then\napplies the MSCI 25/50\nIndex Methodology,\nwhich aims to reflect\n5/25/50 weight\nconstraints (i.e., no\nissuer has a weight\nabove 25%, and the sum\nof weights of all\nissuers with weights\nabove 5% does not\nexceed 50%). The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually, usually as of\nthe close of the last\nbusiness day of May and\nNovember, coinciding\nwith the semi-annual\nindex reviews of the\nMSCI Global Investable\nMarket Indices and of\neach Component Index.\nAs of July 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology and health\ncare sectors, although\nthis may change from\ntime to time. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, the\nIndex comprised 616\nsecurities. The Index\nis sponsored by MSCI,\nInc. (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. 17 Table\nof Contents Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nMid-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-sized\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may be volatile.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Health Care\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the health care\nsector are subject to\nextensive government\nregulation and their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of medical\nproducts and services,\npricing pressure\n(including price\ndiscounting), limited\nproduct lines and an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of\nhealthcare through\noutpatient services.\nCompanies in the health\ncare sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining\nand defending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in technologies\nor other market\ndevelopments. Many new\nproducts in the health\ncare sector require\nsignificant research\nand development and may\nbe subject to\nregulatory approvals,\nall of which may be\ntime consuming and\ncostly with no\nguarantee that any\nproduct will come to\nmarket. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or 18 Table\nof Contents\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e.,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Low\nVolatility Risk:\nAlthough subject to the\nrisks of common stocks,\nlow volatility stocks\nare seen as having a\nlower risk profile than\nthe overall markets.\nHowever, a portfolio\ncomprised of low\nvolatility stocks may\nnot produce investment\nexposure that has lower\nvariability to changes\nin such stocks' price\nlevels. Low volatility\nstocks are likely to\nunderperform the\nbroader market during\nperiods of rapidly\nrising stock prices.\nNon-Diversification\nRisk: To the extent the\nFund becomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Quality\nRisk: A \u201cquality\u201d style\nof investing emphasizes\ncompanies with high\nreturns on equity,\nstable earnings per\nshare growth, and low\nfinancial leverage.\nThis style of investing\nis subject to the risk\nthat the past\nperformance of these\ncompanies does not\ncontinue or that the\nreturns on \u201cquality\u201d\nequity securities are\nless than returns on\nother styles of\ninvesting or the\noverall stock market.\nTechnology Sector Risk:\nMarket or economic\nfactors impacting\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. 19 Table of\nContents Value Stock\nRisk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style\nof investing is subject\nto the risk that the\nreturns on \u201cvalue\u201d\nequity securities are\nless than returns on\nother styles of\ninvesting or the\noverall stock market.\nValue stocks present\nthe risk that they may\ndecline in price or\nnever reach their\nexpected full market\nvalue because the\nmarket fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents Individual Fund Shares may\nonly be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca,\nInc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 20%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nNYSE Technology Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n22 Table of Contents\n\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is composed\nof 35 leading\nU.S.-listed\ntechnology-related\ncompanies. The\ninvestible universe of\nthe Index comprises\nall stocks in the\nTechnology sector and\ntechnology-related\nstocks in the Consumer\nDiscretionary sector,\nas defined by the\nIndex Provider (as\ndefined below) that\nare listed on major\nU.S. stock exchanges\nand meet the following\ncriteria as of the\nindex rebalance\nreference date: (i)\nissued by a company\nwith a minimum market\ncapitalization of $2\nbillion and (ii) have\na trailing 3-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of $10 million.\nStocks must also meet\nat least one of the\nfollowing three\nrevenue- and sales-\nbased criteria: (i)\nhave an increase in\nsales over the last\ntwelve months, (ii)\nhave only one\nconsecutive quarter of\nnegative sales growth\nover the last two\nyears, or (iii) have\nrevenue totals from\nthe last four quarters\nthat classify it\nwithin the top 75\ncompanies within the\nspecific industry\nclassification\ndesignated to it by\nthe Index Provider.\nEligible stocks are\nthen ranked based on\nmarket capitalization\nand liquidity, and the\ntop 35 stocks are\nselected for inclusion\nin the Index. At least\n75% of the companies\nincluded in the Index\nmust be headquartered\nin the United States.\nThe Index is equal-\nweighted and\nrebalanced annually\nafter the close of\ntrading on the third\nFriday of December. As\nof July 31, 2020 the\nIndex comprised 35\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by ICE Data\nIndices, LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. 23 Table of\nContents\n\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\n24 Table of Contents\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\nEffective September 11, 2017, the Fund's\nbenchmark was renamed the NYSE Technology\nIndex due to a transfer of the Index's\nmanagement to ICE Data Indices, LLC.

Kathleen\nMorgan, CFA, is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions Group. She joined\nthe Adviser in 2017. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary 25 Table of\nContentsmarket, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.03%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 12% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index\n(including common\nstock, preferred stock,\ndepositary receipts and\nshares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements\n\n27\n\nTable of Contents and\nmoney market funds\n(including money market\nfunds advised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\nlarge-, mid-, and\nsmall-capitalization\nsegments of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nIndex consists of those\nstocks included in the\nS&P 500 Index, the S&P\nMidCap 400 Index, and\nthe S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex. Each underlying\nindex includes U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE Arca,\nNYSE American, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX that meet specific\nmarket capitalization\nrequirements. To be\nincluded in an\nunderlying index, a\nsecurity (or issuer of\na security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio of\n1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive aggregate\nearnings over the four\nmost recent quarters\nand for the most recent\nquarter. The Index is\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization\nweighted. Index\nconstituents are added\nand removed on an as-\nneeded basis. The Index\nis rebalanced on a\nquarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 1,506 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or 28\nTable of Contents\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n29 Table of Contents\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past performance\n(before and after\ntaxes) is not\nnecessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance information\nis available by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/sp\ndrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 14.41% ( Q1,\n2019)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 15.03% ( Q3,\n2011)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 4.08%.           \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective July 9, 2013, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Dow Jones\nU.S. Total Stock Market Index to Russell 3000\nIndex. Effective November 16, 2017, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Russell 3000\nIndex to the SSGA Total Stock Market Index.\nEffective January 24, 2020, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the SSGA Total\nStock Market Index to the S&P Composite 1500\nIndex. Each benchmark index change was\nconsistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of a new index. Performance of the\nFund prior to January 24, 2020 is therefore\nbased on the Fund's investment strategy to\ntrack the applicable prior indexes.\n                                              \n                OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return        31.56%   11.35%     13.40%    \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      30.94%   10.81%     12.91%    \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  18.99%   8.90%      11.12%    \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  1             31.57%   11.34%     13.53%    \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction     31.49%   11.70%     13.56%    \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     SSGA Total Stock Market Index for the    \n     period from November 16, 2017 to         \n     December 31, 2019, the Russell 3000      \n     Index for the period from July 9, 2013   \n     to November 15, 2017, and the Dow Jones  \n     U.S. Total Stock Market Index for        \n  1  periods prior to July 9, 2013.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.05%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.05%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $5         $16     $28      $64  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 30%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nMidCap 400 Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n32\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is designed\nto measure the\nperformance of the\nmid-capitalization\nsegment of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nselection universe for\nthe Index includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX with\nunadjusted market\ncapitalizations\nbetween $2.4 billion\nand $8.2 billion and\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $1.2 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThese capitalization\nranges may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive\naggregate earnings\nover the four most\nrecent quarters and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. In selecting\nsecurities for\ninclusion in the\nIndex, the Index\nProvider also\nconsiders sector\nbalance by comparing\nthe weight of each\nGICS (Global Industry\nClassification\nStandard) sector in\nthe Index to its\nweight in the relevant\nmarket capitalization\nrange of the S&P Total\nMarket Index. The\nIndex is float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization\nweighted. Index\nconstituents are added\nand removed on an as-\nneeded basis. The\nIndex is rebalanced on\na quarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Index comprised\ncompanies in the\nindustrial and\ntechnology sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 400 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines. 33\nTable of Contents\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\n34 Table of Contents\n\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 14.02% ( Q4,\n2011)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 20.45% ( Q3,\n2011)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was -8.75%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes. Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective July 9, 2013, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Dow Jones\nU.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index to the\nRussell Small Cap Completeness Index.\nEffective August 31, 2016, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Russell Small\nCap Completeness Index to the S&P 1000 Index.\nEffective January 24, 2020, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the S&P 1000\nIndex to the S&P MidCap 400 Index. Each\nbenchmark index change was consistent with a\nchange in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of a new\nindex.

Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Mark Krivitsky\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group and the Tax-Efficient\nMarket Capture Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1996. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n36\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aePortfolio S&P 500 \u00aeETF (formerly, SPDR\nPortfolio Large Cap ETF)\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (the         \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks                               \n  to provide investment results that, before  \n  fees                                        \n  and expenses, correspond generally to the   \n  total                                       \n  return performance of an index that tracks  \n  the                                         \n  performance of large capitalization         \n  exchange                                    \n  traded U.S. equity securities.              \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.03%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 11% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n500 Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of t\nrackingthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index\n(including common\nstock, preferred stock,\ndepositary receipts and\nshares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements\n\n37\n\nTable of Contents and\nmoney market funds\n(including money market\nfunds advised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\nlarge-capitalization\nsegment of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nselection universe for\nthe Index includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nCapital Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX with unadjusted\nmarket capitalizations\nof at least $8.2\nbillion and float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $4.1 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThese capitalization\nranges may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio of\n1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive aggregate\nearnings over the four\nmost recent quarters\nand for the most recent\nquarter. In selecting\nsecurities for\ninclusion in the Index,\nthe Index Provider also\nconsiders sector\nbalance by comparing\nthe weight of each GICS\n(Global Industry\nClassification\nStandard) sector in the\nIndex to its weight in\nthe relevant market\ncapitalization range of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex. The Index is\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization\nweighted. Index\nconstituents are added\nand removed on an as-\nneeded basis. The Index\nis rebalanced on a\nquarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Index comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 505 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. 38 Table of\nContents Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel. 39 Table of\nContents Unconstrained\nSector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a\nsubstantial portion of\nits assets within one\nor more economic\nsectors or industries,\nwhich may change from\ntime to time. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past performance\n(before and after\ntaxes) is not\nnecessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance information\nis available by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/sp\ndrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 14.30% ( Q1,\n2019)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 14.27% ( Q3,\n2011)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 5.64%.           \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective July 9, 2013, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Dow Jones\nU.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index to the\nRussell 1000 Index. Effective November 16,\n2017, the Fund's benchmark index changed from\nthe Russell 1000 Index to the SSGA Large Cap\nIndex. Effective January 24, 2020, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the SSGA Large\nCap Index to the S&P 500 Index. Each benchmark\nindex change was consistent with a change in\nthe Fund's principal investment strategy to\ntrack the performance of a new index.\nPerformance of the Fund prior to January 24,\n2020 is therefore based on the Fund's\ninvestment strategy to track the applicable\nprior indexes.\n                                              \n                OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return        32.06%   11.57%     13.48%    \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      31.41%   10.96%     12.93%    \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  19.30%   9.03%      11.14%    \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  1             32.15%   11.63%     13.60%    \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction     31.49%   11.70%     13.56%    \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     SSGA Large Cap Index for the period      \n     from November 16, 2017 to December 31,   \n     2019, the Russell 1000 Index for the     \n     period from July 9, 2013 to November     \n     15, 2017, and the Dow Jones U.S.         \n     Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index for   \n  1  periods prior to July 9, 2013.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and John Law. Michael Feehily,\nCFA, is a Senior Managing Director of the\nAdviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010.

He\njoined the Adviser in 2016.\n\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.04%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.04%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $4         $13     $23      $51  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 23% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n500 Growth Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. 42\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex measures the\nperformance of the\nlarge-capitalization\ngrowth segment of the\nU.S. equity market. The\nIndex consists of those\nstocks in the S&P 500\nIndex exhibiting the\nstrongest growth\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) sales growth;\n(ii) earnings change to\nprice; and (iii)\nmomentum. The S&P 500\nIndex focuses on the\nlarge capitalization\nU.S. equity market,\nincluding common stock\nand real estate\ninvestment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d). The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P 500 Index\nincludes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE Arca,\nNYSE American, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX with unadjusted\nmarket capitalizations\nof at least $8.2\nbillion and float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $4.1 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThe minimum required\ncapitalization may be\nrevised by the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) at any time. To\nbe included in the\nIndex, a security (or\nissuer of a security,\nas applicable) should\n(i) have an annual\ndollar value traded to\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization ratio of\n1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the sum\nof earnings over those\nquarters) and for the\nmost recent quarter.\nMeeting these criteria\ndoes not guarantee\nautomatic inclusion\ninto the Index. Given\nthe limited number of\ncompanies that the\nIndex can have and that\nit must reflect sector\nrepresentation, some\neligible companies may\nnot be added to the\nIndex at a particular\ntime. S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC's Index\nCommittee makes the\nfinal determination and\napproval of all Index\nconstituents. The Index\nis market\ncapitalization weighted\nand rebalanced annually\non the third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe technology and\nconsumer discretionary\nsectors, although this\nmay change from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 279 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Growth\nStock Risk: The prices\nof growth stocks may be\nbased largely on\nexpectations of future\nearnings, and their\nprices can decline\nrapidly and\nsignificantly in\nreaction to negative\nnews. Growth stocks may\nunderperform value\nstocks and stocks in\nother broad style\ncategories (and the\nstock market as a\nwhole) over any period\nof time and may shift\nin and out of favor\nwith investors\ngenerally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on\nchanges in market,\neconomic, and other\nfactors. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\n43 Table of Contents\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines.Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector\nRisk: The success of\nconsumer product\nmanufacturers and\nretailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily\non disposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. Also,\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on their\nrespective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser.Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may hold\na smaller number of\nportfolio securities\nthan many other funds.\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively\nsmall number of\nissuers, a decline in\nthe market value of a\nparticular security\nheld by the Fund may\naffect its value more\nthan if it invested in\na larger number of\nissuers. The value of\nFund Shares may be more\nvolatile than the\nvalues of shares of\nmore diversified funds.\nThe Fund may become\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\n44 Table of Contents\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts.

Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.07%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.07%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $7         $23     $40      $90  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 45% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n500 High Dividend Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 47\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of 80\nhigh dividend-yielding\ncompanies within the\nS&P 500 \u00aeIndex. The S&P\n500 Index focuses on\nthe large\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity market,\nincluding common stock\nand real estate\ninvestment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d). The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P 500 Index\nincludes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE Arca,\nNYSE American, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX with unadjusted\nmarket capitalizations\nof at least $8.2\nbillion and float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $4.1 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThe minimum required\ncapitalization may be\nrevised by the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) at any time. To\ndetermine dividend\nyield: (i) an indicated\ndividend is measured by\ntaking the latest\ndividend paid\n(excluding special\npayments) multiplied by\nthe annual frequency of\nthe payment; and (ii)\nthe indicated dividend\nis then divided by the\ncompany's share price\nas of the rebalancing\nreference date. Index\nconstituents are\nequally weighted and\nthe Index is rebalanced\nsemi-annually, in\nJanuary and July. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial and\nindustrial sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 61 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nDividend Paying\nSecurities Risk:\nSecurities that pay\ndividends, as a group,\ncan fall out of favor\nwith the market,\ncausing such companies\nto underperform\ncompanies that do not\npay dividends. In\naddition, changes in\nthe dividend policies\nof the companies held\nby the Fund or the\ncapital resources\navailable for such\ncompany's dividend\npayments may adversely\naffect the Fund. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. 48 Table of\nContents Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\n49 Table of Contents to\ncontrol the U.S. (and\nother) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). REIT Risk:\nReal estate investment\ntrusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) are\nsubject to the risks\nassociated with\ninvesting in the\nsecurities of real\nproperty companies. In\nparticular, REITs may\nbe affected by changes\nin the values of the\nunderlying properties\nthat they own or\noperate. Further, REITs\nare dependent upon\nspecialized management\nskills, and their\ninvestments may be\nconcentrated in\nrelatively few\nproperties, or in a\nsmall geographic area\nor a single property\ntype. REITs are also\nsubject to heavy cash\nflow dependency and, as\na result, are\nparticularly reliant on\nthe proper functioning\nof capital markets. A\nvariety of economic and\nother factors may\nadversely affect a\nlessee's ability to\nmeet its obligations to\na REIT. In the event of\na default by a lessee,\nthe REIT may experience\ndelays in enforcing its\nrights as a lessor and\nmay incur substantial\ncosts associated in\nprotecting its\ninvestments. In\naddition, a REIT could\nfail to qualify for\nfavorable regulatory\ntreatment.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. 50\n\nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                   OneYear  Since             \n                            Inception(10/21\u2026  \n  Return Before    21.35%   11.81%            \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on         19.82%   10.19%            \n  Distributions                               \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributions    13.26%   8.77%             \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P 500 High                                \n  Dividend Index                              \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction        21.49%   11.94%            \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for    31.49%   14.18%            \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and John Law. Michael Feehily,\nCFA, is a Senior Managing Director of the\nAdviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. John Law, CFA,\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2016. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.04%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.04%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $4         $13     $23      $51  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 34% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n500 Value Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 52\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nmeasures the\nperformance of the\nlarge-capitalization\nvalue segment of the\nU.S. equity market. The\nIndex consists of those\nstocks in the S&P 500\nIndex exhibiting the\nstrongest value\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) book value to\nprice ratio; (ii)\nearnings to price\nratio; and (iii) sales\nto price ratio. The S&P\n500 Index focuses on\nthe large\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity market,\nincluding common stock\nand real estate\ninvestment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d). The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P 500 Index\nincludes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE Arca,\nNYSE American, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX with unadjusted\nmarket capitalizations\nof at least $8.2\nbillion and float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $4.1 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThe minimum required\ncapitalization may be\nrevised by the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) at any time. To\nbe included in the\nIndex, a security (or\nissuer of a security,\nas applicable) should\n(i) have an annual\ndollar value traded to\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization ratio of\n1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the sum\nof earnings over those\nquarters) and for the\nmost recent quarter.\nMeeting these criteria\ndoes not guarantee\nautomatic inclusion\ninto the Index. Given\nthe limited number of\ncompanies that the\nIndex can have and that\nit must reflect sector\nrepresentation, some\neligible companies may\nnot be added to the\nIndex at a particular\ntime. S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC's Index\nCommittee makes the\nfinal determination and\napproval of all Index\nconstituents. The Index\nis market\ncapitalization weighted\nand rebalanced annually\non the third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe financial and\nhealth care sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 390 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Value\nStock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d\nstyle of investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\n53 Table of Contents\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Health Care\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the health care\nsector are subject to\nextensive government\nregulation and their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of medical\nproducts and services,\npricing pressure\n(including price\ndiscounting), limited\nproduct lines and an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of\nhealthcare through\noutpatient services.\nCompanies in the health\ncare sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining\nand defending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in technologies\nor other market\ndevelopments. Many new\nproducts in the health\ncare sector require\nsignificant research\nand development and may\nbe subject to\nregulatory approvals,\nall of which may be\ntime consuming and\ncostly with no\nguarantee that any\nproduct will come to\nmarket. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully 54\nTable of Contents\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective December 17, 2010 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Dow Jones\nU.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index\n(the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the S&P\n500 Value Index, consistent with a change in\nthe Fund's principal investment strategy to\ntrack the performance of the current index.\nPerformance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark\nIndex Change Date is therefore based on the\nFund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index.\n             55 Table of Contents             \n                                              \n                OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return        31.78%   9.41%      12.03%    \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      30.95%   8.66%      11.38%    \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  19.20%   7.24%      9.85%     \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  1             31.93%   9.52%      12.21%    \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction     31.49%   11.70%     13.56%    \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Mark Krivitsky. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Mark Krivitsky\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group and the Tax-Efficient\nMarket Capture Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1996. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.\n\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased\nand sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.05%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.05%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $5         $16     $28      $64  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 80%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of\ntrackingthe Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). When the\nFund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n57\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index measures the\nperformance of the\nsmall-capitalization\nsegment of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nselection universe for\nthe Index includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX with\nunadjusted market\ncapitalizations\nbetween $600 million\nand $2.4 billion and\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $300 million at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThese capitalization\nranges may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive\naggregate earnings\nover the four most\nrecent quarters and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. In selecting\nsecurities for\ninclusion in the\nIndex, the Index\nProvider also\nconsiders sector\nbalance by comparing\nthe weight of each\nGICS (Global Industry\nClassification\nStandard) sector in\nthe Index to its\nweight in the relevant\nmarket capitalization\nrange of the S&P Total\nMarket Index. The\nIndex is float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization\nweighted. Index\nconstituents are added\nand removed on an as-\nneeded basis. The\nIndex is rebalanced on\na quarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Index comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial, industrial\nand consumer\ndiscretionary sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 601 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines. 58\nTable of Contents\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na 59 Table of Contents\n\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective November 16, 2017, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the 60\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRussell 2000 Index to the SSGA Small Cap\nIndex. Effective January 24, 2020, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the SSGA Small\nCap Index to the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. Each\nbenchmark index change was consistent with a\nchange in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of a new\nindex. Performance of the Fund prior to\nJanuary 24, 2020 is therefore based on the\nFund's investment strategy to track the\napplicable prior indexes.\n                                              \n              OneYear  FiveYears  Since       \n                                  Inception\u2026  \n  Return                                      \n  Before      25.87%   8.46%      9.73%       \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return                                      \n  After       25.25%   7.81%      9.08%       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribut\u2026                                  \n  Return                                      \n  After                                       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribut\u2026  15.51%   6.40%      7.52%       \n  and Sale                                    \n  of                                          \n  Fund                                        \n  Shares                                      \n  1           26.02%   8.43%      9.72%       \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects                                   \n  no          31.49%   11.70%     13.32%      \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses                                    \n  or taxes)                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     SSGA Small Cap Index for the period      \n     from November 16, 2017 to December 31,   \n     2019, and the Russell 2000 Index for     \n  1  periods prior to November 16, 2017.      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Teddy Wong. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Teddy Wong is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2001. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 28%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nRussell 1000 Low\nVolatility Focused\nFactor Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of\ntrackingthe Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). When the\nFund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index (including\ncommon stock,\npreferred stock,\ndepositary receipts\nand shares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the\n\n62\n\nTable of Contents\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is designed\nto reflect the\nperformance of a\nsegment of large-\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity securities\ndemonstrating a\ncombination of core\nfactors (high value,\nhigh quality, and low\nsize characteristics),\nwith a focus factor\ncomprising low\nvolatility\ncharacteristics (the\n\u201cFactor\nCharacteristics\u201d). To\nconstruct the Index,\nFrank Russell Company\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d)\nutilizes a rules-based\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess that seeks to\nincrease exposure (or\n\u201ctilt\u201d) to companies\nin the Russell 1000\nIndex demonstrating\nthe Factor\nCharacteristics. The\nRussell 1000 Index is\na market-\ncapitalization index\nthat measures the\nperformance of the\nlarge-cap segment of\nthe U.S. equity\nuniverse. Within the\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess, a specific\nfocus is applied\ntowards a company's\nvolatility factor.\nVolatility is a\nstatistical\nmeasurement of the\nmagnitude of movements\nin a stock's price\nover time. Each\nstock's factor scores\nare multiplied by the\nstock's free float\nmarket cap weight in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nto determine each\nconstituent's weight\nin the multi-factor\nIndex. Companies in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nare excluded from the\nIndex if they do not\nmeet a minimum weight\nin the Index. A\ncompany's volatility\nfactor score is based\non the standard\ndeviation of weekly\ntotal returns to a\ncompany's stock price\nover the trailing five\nyears ending on the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nvalue factor score is\nbased on cash flow\nyield, earnings yield,\nand country relative\nsales to price ratio,\ncalculated based on\nthe company's total\nmarket capitalization\nand information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nquality factor score\nis based on return on\nassets, change in\nasset turnover,\naccruals, and\nleverage, calculated\nbased on information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nsize factor score is\nbased on total market\ncapitalization as of\nthe last business day\nof the month prior to\nthe Index rebalancing\nmonth. The weight of\neach individual stock\nin the Index is capped\nat 2000% of the\nstock's weight in the\nRussell 1000 Index,\nand any weight\nexceeding this limit\nwill be redistributed\nto all stocks below\nthe limit in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nweight of each\nindustry in the Index\nis capped at 120% of\nthe industry's weight\nin the Russell 1000\nIndex plus an\nadditional 5%, and any\nweight exceeding this\nlimit is redistributed\nto all other\nindustries below the\nlimit in proportion to\ntheir combination of\nmarket capitalization\nand factor scoring.\nThe weight of each\nindustry in the Index\nmust be at least 80%\nof the industry's\nweight in the Russell\n1000 Index less 5%.\nThe weights of any\nindustries below this\nminimum will be\nincreased to the\nminimum by\nredistributing the\nweights of industries\nabove the minimum in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nannually in June. As\nof July 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial and consumer\ndiscretionary sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020 there were\napproximately 460\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by the Index\nProvider, which is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. 63 Table of\nContents Low\nVolatility Risk:\nAlthough subject to\nthe risks of common\nstocks, low volatility\nstocks are seen as\nhaving a lower risk\nprofile than the\noverall markets.\nHowever, a portfolio\ncomprised of low\nvolatility stocks may\nnot produce investment\nexposure that has\nlower variability to\nchanges in such\nstocks' price levels.\nLow volatility stocks\nare likely to\nunderperform the\nbroader market during\nperiods of rapidly\nrising stock prices.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser.Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. 6 4\nTable of Contents\n\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e., achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nQuality Risk: A\n\u201cquality\u201d style of\ninvesting emphasizes\ncompanies with high\nreturns on equity,\nstable earnings per\nshare growth, and low\nfinancial leverage.\nThis style of\ninvesting is subject\nto the risk that the\npast performance of\nthese companies does\nnot continue or that\nthe returns on\n\u201cquality\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Unconstrained\nSector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a\nsubstantial portion of\nits assets within one\nor more economic\nsectors or industries,\nwhich may change from\ntime to time. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Value\nStock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d\nstyle of investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Emiliano Rabinovich, CFA, is\na Managing Director of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2006. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n66 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeRussell 1000 \u00aeMomentum Focus ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Russell 1000 Momentum Focus ETF    \n  (the                                        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment         \n  results that,                               \n  before fees and expenses, correspond        \n  generally to                                \n  the total return performance of the         \n  Russell 1000                                \n  Momentum Focused Factor Index.              \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 42%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nRussell 1000 Momentum\nFocused Factor Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index (including\ncommon stock,\npreferred stock,\ndepositary receipts\nand shares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the\n\n67\n\nTable of Contents\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is designed\nto reflect the\nperformance of a\nsegment of large-\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity securities\ndemonstrating a\ncombination of core\nfactors (high value,\nhigh quality, and low\nsize characteristics),\nwith a focus factor\ncomprising high\nmomentum\ncharacteristics (the\n\u201cFactor\nCharacteristics\u201d). To\nconstruct the Index,\nFrank Russell Company\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d)\nutilizes a rules-based\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess that seeks to\nincrease exposure (or\n\u201ctilt\u201d) to companies\nin the Russell 1000\nIndex demonstrating\nthe Factor\nCharacteristics. The\nRussell 1000 Index is\na market-\ncapitalization index\nthat measures the\nperformance of the\nlarge-cap segment of\nthe U.S. equity\nuniverse. Within the\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess, a specific\nfocus is applied\ntowards a company's\nmomentum factor.\nCompanies with higher\nmomentum are those\nwhose securities have\nhad higher recent\nprice performance\ncompared to other\nsecurities. Each\nstock's factor scores\nare multiplied by the\nstock's free float\nmarket cap weight in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nto determine each\nconstituent's weight\nin the multi-factor\nIndex. Companies in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nare excluded from the\nIndex if they do not\nmeet a minimum weight\nin the Index. A\ncompany's momentum\nfactor score is based\non historical total\nreturn over the 11\nmonths ending on the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nvalue factor score is\nbased on cash flow\nyield, earnings yield,\nand country relative\nsales to price ratio,\ncalculated based on\nthe company's total\nmarket capitalization\nand information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nquality factor score\nis based on return on\nassets, change in\nasset turnover,\naccruals, and\nleverage, calculated\nbased on information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nsize factor score is\nbased on total market\ncapitalization as of\nthe last business day\nof the month prior to\nthe Index rebalancing\nmonth. The weight of\neach individual stock\nin the Index is capped\nat 2000% of the\nstock's weight in the\nRussell 1000 Index,\nand any weight\nexceeding this limit\nwill be redistributed\nto all stocks below\nthe limit in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nweight of each\nindustry in the Index\nis capped at 120% of\nthe industry's weight\nin the Russell 1000\nIndex plus an\nadditional 5%, and any\nweight exceeding this\nlimit is redistributed\nto all other\nindustries below the\nlimit in proportion to\ntheir combination of\nmarket capitalization\nand factor scoring.\nThe weight of each\nindustry in the Index\nmust be at least 80%\nof the industry's\nweight in the Russell\n1000 Index less 5%.\nThe weights of any\nindustries below this\nminimum will be\nincreased to the\nminimum by\nredistributing the\nweights of industries\nabove the minimum in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nsemi-annually in June\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nand technology\nsectors, although this\nmay change from time\nto time. As of July\n31, 2020 there were\napproximately 931\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by the Index\nProvider, which is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. 68 Table of\nContents Momentum\nRisk: The Fund employs\na \u201cmomentum\u201d style of\ninvesting that\nemphasizes investing\nin securities that\nhave had higher recent\nprice performance\ncompared to other\nsecurities. This style\nof investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat these securities\nmay be more volatile\nthan a broad cross-\nsection of securities\nor that the returns on\nsecurities that have\npreviously exhibited\nprice momentum are\nless than returns on\nother styles of\ninvesting or the\noverall stock market.\nMomentum can turn\nquickly and cause\nsignificant variation\nfrom other types of\ninvestments.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the 69 Table\nof Contents\n\nability of the Fund to\nobtain cash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nQuality Risk: A\n\u201cquality\u201d style of\ninvesting emphasizes\ncompanies with high\nreturns on equity,\nstable earnings per\nshare growth, and low\nfinancial leverage.\nThis style of\ninvesting is subject\nto the risk that the\npast performance of\nthese companies does\nnot continue or that\nthe returns on\n\u201cquality\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Value\nStock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d\nstyle of investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 34%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nRussell 1000 Yield\nFocused Factor Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index (including\ncommon stock,\npreferred stock,\ndepositary receipts\nand shares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the\n\n72\n\nTable of Contents\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is designed\nto reflect the\nperformance of a\nsegment of large-\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity securities\ndemonstrating a\ncombination of core\nfactors (high value,\nhigh quality, and low\nsize characteristics),\nwith a focus factor\ncomprising high yield\ncharacteristics (the\n\u201cFactor\nCharacteristics\u201d). To\nconstruct the Index,\nFrank Russell Company\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d)\nutilizes a rules-based\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess that seeks to\nincrease exposure (or\n\u201ctilt\u201d) to companies\nin the Russell 1000\nIndex demonstrating\nthe Factor\nCharacteristics. The\nRussell 1000 Index is\na market-\ncapitalization index\nthat measures the\nperformance of the\nlarge-cap segment of\nthe U.S. equity\nuniverse. Within the\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess, a specific\nfocus is applied\ntowards a company's\nyield factor.\nCompanies with higher\nyield are those whose\nsecurities have paid\nhigher dividends\ncompared to other\nsecurities. Each\nstock's factor scores\nare multiplied by the\nstock's free float\nmarket cap weight in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nto determine each\nconstituent's weight\nin the multi-factor\nIndex. Companies in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nare excluded from the\nIndex if they do not\nmeet a minimum weight\nin the Index. A\ncompany's yield factor\nscore is based on\n12-month trailing\ndividend yield as of\nthe last business day\nof the month prior to\nthe Index rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nvalue factor score is\nbased on cash flow\nyield, earnings yield,\nand country relative\nsales to price ratio,\ncalculated based on\nthe company's total\nmarket capitalization\nand information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nquality factor score\nis based on return on\nassets, change in\nasset turnover,\naccruals, and\nleverage, calculated\nbased on information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nsize factor score is\nbased on the log of\nthe total market\ncapitalization as of\nthe last business day\nof the month prior to\nthe Index rebalancing\nmonth. The weight of\neach individual stock\nin the Index is capped\nat 2000% of the\nstock's weight in the\nRussell 1000 Index,\nand any weight\nexceeding this limit\nwill be redistributed\nto all stocks below\nthe limit in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nweight of each\nindustry in the Index\nis capped at 120% of\nthe industry's weight\nin the Russell 1000\nIndex plus an\nadditional 5%, and any\nweight exceeding this\nlimit is redistributed\nto all other\nindustries below the\nlimit in proportion to\ntheir combination of\nmarket capitalization\nand factor scoring.\nThe weight of each\nindustry in the Index\nmust be at least 80%\nof the industry's\nweight in the Russell\n1000 Index less 5%.\nThe weights of any\nindustries below this\nminimum will be\nincreased to the\nminimum by\nredistributing the\nweights of industries\nabove the minimum in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nannually in June. As\nof July 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector, although this\nmay change from time\nto time. As of July\n31, 2020, there were\napproximately 286\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by the Index\nProvider, which is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. 73 Table of\nContents Dividend\nPaying Securities\nRisk: Securities that\npay dividends, as a\ngroup, can fall out of\nfavor with the market,\ncausing such companies\nto underperform\ncompanies that do not\npay dividends. In\naddition, changes in\nthe dividend policies\nof the companies held\nby the Fund or the\ncapital resources\navailable for such\ncompany's dividend\npayments may adversely\naffect the Fund.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations 74\nTable of Contents\n\non investments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nQuality Risk: A\n\u201cquality\u201d style of\ninvesting emphasizes\ncompanies with high\nreturns on equity,\nstable earnings per\nshare growth, and low\nfinancial leverage.\nThis style of\ninvesting is subject\nto the risk that the\npast performance of\nthese companies does\nnot continue or that\nthe returns on\n\u201cquality\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Unconstrained\nSector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a\nsubstantial portion of\nits assets within one\nor more economic\nsectors or industries,\nwhich may change from\ntime to time. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Value\nStock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d\nstyle of investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information\nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n76\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF (the    \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of an index that   \n  tracks                                      \n  the performance of U.S. equity securities   \n  exhibiting price momentum.                  \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.12%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.12%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 65% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n1500 Positive Momentum\nTilt Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n77\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex applies an\nalternative weighting\nmethodology to the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index so\nthat stocks with\nrelatively high\nmomentum are overweight\nrelative to the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index\nand stocks with\nrelatively low momentum\nare underweight. The\nS&P Composite 1500\nIndex, one of the\nleading indices of the\nU.S. equity market, is\na capitalization-\nweighted combination of\nthe large-cap S&P 500\nIndex, the S&P MidCap\n400 Index, and the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index. A\n\u201cmomentum\u201d style of\ninvesting emphasizes\ninvesting in securities\nthat have had higher\nrecent price\nperformance compared to\nother securities. In\nconstructing the Index,\nthe Index Provider (as\ndefined below)\nestimates the momentum\nof each stock in the\nS&P Composite 1500\nIndex based on its\nprice performance over\nthe 11 months ending on\nthe rebalancing\nreference date and\nranks all 1,500 Index\nconstituents in order\nof momentum. S&P then\nforms 20 sub-portfolios\nof approximately equal\nmarket capitalization,\ngrouped by momentum.\nS&P defines a sub-\nportfolio allocation\nfactor so that a sub-\nportfolio with\nrelatively high\nmomentum will have a\nhigher allocation\nfactor than a sub-\nportfolio with\nrelatively low\nmomentum. The weight of\neach stock in the Index\nis proportionate to its\nmarket capitalization\nand to its sub-\nportfolio allocation\nfactor. The Index is\nrebalanced quarterly,\neffective after the\nclose on the third\nFriday of January,\nApril, July, and\nOctober. As of July 31,\n2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe technology and\nheath care sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were\napproximately 1,505\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nMomentum Risk: The Fund\nemploys a \u201cmomentum\u201d\nstyle of investing that\nemphasizes investing in\nsecurities that have\nhad higher recent price\nperformance compared to\nother securities. This\nstyle of investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat these securities\nmay be more volatile\nthan a broad cross-\nsection of securities\nor that the returns on\nsecurities that have\npreviously exhibited\nprice momentum are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Momentum can\nturn quickly and cause\nsignificant variation\nfrom other types of\ninvestments.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty. 78 Table\nof Contents Derivatives\nRisk: Derivative\ntransactions can create\ninvestment leverage and\nmay have significant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Health Care\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the health care\nsector are subject to\nextensive government\nregulation and their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of medical\nproducts and services,\npricing pressure\n(including price\ndiscounting), limited\nproduct lines and an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of\nhealthcare through\noutpatient services.\nCompanies in the health\ncare sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining\nand defending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in technologies\nor other market\ndevelopments. Many new\nproducts in the health\ncare sector require\nsignificant research\nand development and may\nbe subject to\nregulatory approvals,\nall of which may be\ntime consuming and\ncostly with no\nguarantee that any\nproduct will come to\nmarket. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may hold\na smaller number of\nportfolio securities\nthan many other funds.\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively\nsmall number of\nissuers, a decline in\nthe market value of a\nparticular security\nheld by the Fund may\naffect its value more\nthan if it invested in\na larger number of\nissuers. The value of\nFund Shares may be more\nvolatile than the\nvalues of shares of\nmore diversified funds.\nThe Fund may become\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect 79\nTable of Contents\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n81 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 1500 Value Tilt ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 1500 Value Tilt ETF (the       \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of an index that   \n  tracks                                      \n  the performance of U.S. equity securities   \n  exhibiting \u201cvalue\u201d characteristics.         \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.12%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.12%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 16%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n1500 Low Valuation\nTilt Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\n\n82\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex applies an\nalternative weighting\nmethodology to the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index\nso that stocks with\nrelatively low\nvaluations ( i.e.,\nrelatively \u201ccheap\u201d)\nare overweight\nrelative to the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index\nand stocks with\nrelatively high\nvaluations ( i.e.,\nrelatively \u201crich\u201d) are\nunderweight. The S&P\nComposite 1500 Index,\none of the leading\nindices of the U.S.\nequity market, is a\ncapitalization-\nweighted combination\nof the large-cap S&P\n500 Index, the S&P\nMidCap 400 Index, and\nthe S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex. In constructing\nthe Index, the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) estimates the\nvaluation of each\nstock in the S& P\nComposite 1500 Index\nbased on the ratio of\nits price to its level\nof earnings, cash\nflow, sales, book\nvalue, and dividends.\nS&P weights this data\nfrom the last five\ncalendar years to\ncreate a composite\nvaluation measure, and\nranks all 1,500 index\nconstituents in order\nof composite\nvaluation. S&P then\nforms 20 sub-\nportfolios of\napproximately equal\nmarket capitalization,\ngrouped by composite\nvaluations. S&P\nderives a sub-\nportfolio allocation\nfactor using each sub-\nportfolio's composite\nvaluation, so that a\nsub-portfolio with\nrelatively low\nvaluation will have a\nhigher allocation\nfactor than a sub-\nportfolio with\nrelatively high\nvaluation. The weight\nof each stock in the\nIndex is proportionate\nto its market\ncapitalization and to\nits sub-portfolio\nallocation factor. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nannually after the\nclose of business on\nthe third Friday of\nApril. As of July 31,\n2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe financial sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were\napproximately 1,483\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Value Stock\nRisk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style\nof investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a 83\nTable of Contents\n\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. 84\nTable of Contents\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                              \n              OneYear  FiveYears  Since       \n                                  Inception\u2026  \n  Return                                      \n  Before      26.37%   9.44%      13.08%      \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return                                      \n  After       25.64%   8.56%      11.98%      \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribut\u2026                                  \n  Return                                      \n  After                                       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribut\u2026  16.02%   7.21%      10.30%      \n  and Sale                                    \n  of Fund                                     \n  Shares                                      \n  S&P 1500                                    \n  Low                                         \n  Valuation                                   \n  Tilt Index                                  \n  (reflects   26.44%   9.54%      13.32%      \n  no                                          \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses                                    \n  or taxes)                                   \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects                                   \n  no                                          \n  deduction   31.49%   11.70%     14.60%      \n  for                                         \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses                                    \n  or taxes)                                   \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and John Law. Michael Feehily,\nCFA, is a Senior Managing Director of the\nAdviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. John Law, CFA,\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2016. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary 85 Table of\nContents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n86\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 400 Mid Cap Growth ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Growth ETF (the    \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of an index that   \n  tracks                                      \n  the performance of medium capitalization    \n  exchange                                    \n  traded U.S. equity securities exhibiting    \n  \u201cgrowth\u201d                                    \n  characteristics.                            \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.15%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 45%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nMidCap 400 Growth\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n87\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index measures the\nperformance of the\nmid-capitalization\ngrowth segment of the\nU.S. equity market.\nThe Index consists of\nthose stocks in the\nS&P MidCap 400 Index\nexhibiting the\nstrongest growth\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) sales growth;\n(ii) earnings change\nto price; and (iii)\nmomentum. The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P MidCap 400\nIndex includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX with market\ncapitalizations\nbetween $2.4 billion\nand $8.2 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThis capitalization\nrange may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the\nsum of earnings over\nthose quarters) and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and\nrebalanced annually on\nthe third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nconsumer\ndiscretionary,\nindustrial and health\ncare sectors, although\nthis may change from\ntime to time. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, the\nIndex comprised 240\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Growth Stock\nRisk: The prices of\ngrowth stocks may be\nbased largely on\nexpectations of future\nearnings, and their\nprices can decline\nrapidly and\nsignificantly in\nreaction to negative\nnews. Growth stocks\nmay underperform value\nstocks and stocks in\nother broad style\ncategories (and the\nstock market as a\nwhole) over any period\nof time and may shift\nin and out of favor\nwith investors\ngenerally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on\nchanges in market,\neconomic, and other\nfactors. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times 88 Table\nof Contents when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Health\nCare Sector Risk:\nCompanies in the\nhealth care sector are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernment regulation\nand their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of\nmedical products and\nservices, pricing\npressure (including\nprice discounting),\nlimited product lines\nand an increased\nemphasis on the\ndelivery of healthcare\nthrough outpatient\nservices. Companies in\nthe health care sector\nare heavily dependent\non obtaining and\ndefending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in\ntechnologies or other\nmarket developments.\nMany new products in\nthe health care sector\nrequire significant\nresearch and\ndevelopment and may be\nsubject to regulatory\napprovals, all of\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly\nwith no guarantee that\nany product will come\nto market. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause 89 Table of\nContents\n\ncompanies involved in\nthis industry rely, to\na significant extent,\non U.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective December 17, 2010 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Dow Jones\nU.S. Mid-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index\n(the \u201cPrevious 90 Table of Contents Benchmark\nIndex\u201d) to the S&P MidCap 400 Growth Index,\nconsistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals    \nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day      \nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,   \nKarl Schneider and Juan Acevedo. Michael      \nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the   \nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in     \n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing     \nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of    \nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas. \nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Juan Acevedo is\na Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior  \nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta   \nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in     \n2000. Purchase and Sale Information           \nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.15%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 45%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nMidCap 400 Value Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n92\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index measures the\nperformance of the\nmid-capitalization\nvalue segment of the\nU.S. equity market.\nThe Index consists of\nthose stocks in the\nS&P MidCap 400 Index\nexhibiting the\nstrongest value\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) book value to\nprice ratio; (ii)\nearnings to price\nratio; and (iii) sales\nto price ratio. The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P MidCap 400\nIndex includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX with market\ncapitalizations\nbetween $2.4 billion\nand $8.2 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThis capitalization\nrange may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the\nsum of earnings over\nthose quarters) and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and\nrebalanced annually on\nthe third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 295 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Value Stock\nRisk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style\nof investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines. 93\nTable of Contents\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more 94\nTable of Contents\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Michael Feehily, Karl Schneider\nand Juan Acevedo. Michael Feehily, CFA, is a\nSenior Managing Director of the Adviser and\nthe Head of Global Equity Beta Solutions in\nthe Americas. He worked at the Adviser from\n1997 to 2006 and rejoined in 2010. Karl\nSchneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the\nAdviser and Deputy Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He joined the\nAdviser in 1997. Juan Acevedo is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2000. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n96 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 500 \u00aeESG ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)       \n  seeks to                                    \n  provide investment results that, before     \n  fees and                                    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  total return                                \n  performance of an index that provides       \n  exposure to                                 \n  securities that meet certain                \n  sustainability                              \n  criteria (criteria related to               \n  environmental,                              \n  social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors)      \n  while                                       \n  maintaining similar overall industry group  \n  weights                                     \n  as the S&P 500 Index.                       \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                  \n  Year 1  Year 3  \n  $10        $32  \n                  \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. The Fund commenced operations on\nJuly 28, 2020 and, as a result, does not have\na portfolio turnover rate to report as of the\nmost recent fiscal year end. The Fund's\nPrincipal Investment Strategy In seeking to\ntrack the performance of the S&P 500 ESG Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling\nstrategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund\nmay purchase a subset of the securities in the\nIndex in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size\nof the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may invest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of securities in the Index\nor may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined\nby the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective.The Fund is\nclassified as \u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may become \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nsolely as a result of tracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in weightings of one or more\ncomponent securities). When the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may invest a relatively high\npercentage of its assets in a limited number\nof issuers. Under normal market conditions,\nthe Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not\nincluded in the Index, cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments, such\nas repurchase 97\n\nTable of Contents\n\nagreements and money market funds (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nwill generally be concentrated in an industry\nor group of industries to the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. Futures contracts (a type\nof derivative instrument) may be used by the\nFund in seeking performance that corresponds\nto the Index and in managing cash flows. The\nIndex is designed to measure the performance\nof securities meeting certain sustainability\ncriteria (criteria related to ESG factors),\nwhile maintaining similar overall industry\ngroup weights as the S&P 500 Index. Securities\neligible for inclusion in the Index comprise\nall constituents of the S&P 500 Index except\nfor companies that:\n                                              \n     Have involvement with tobacco-related    \n     products and services, based on certain  \n  \u2022  levels of production, revenue or         \n     ownership, as determined by              \n     Sustainalytics;                          \n     Are involved in controversial weapons,   \n     including cluster weapons, landmines,    \n     biological or chemical weapons,          \n  \u2022  depleted uranium weapons, white          \n     phosphorus weapons, or nuclear weapons,  \n     or hold certain ownership stakes in a    \n     company involved in these activities,    \n     as determined by Sustainalytics;         \n     Have a United Nations Global Compact     \n  \u2022  (\u201cUNGC\u201d) score in the bottom 5% of all   \n     UNGC-scored companies globally, as       \n     determined by Arabesque;                 \n     Have an S&P DJI ESG Score, as assigned   \n     by SAM, that falls within the worst 25%  \n     from each Global Industry                \n  \u2022  Classification Standard (GICS) industry  \n     group among the combined constituents    \n     of the S&P Global LargeMidCap Index and  \n     the S&P Global 1200 Index;               \n     Generate 5% or greater of their revenue  \n  \u2022  from thermal coal extraction or power    \n     generation, as determined by             \n     Sustainalytics; or                       \n     Do not have (i) Sustainalytics coverage  \n     for tobacco-, controversial weapons-     \n  \u2022  and thermal coal-related involvement;    \n     (ii) a UNGC score determined by          \n     Arabesque; or (iii) an S&P DJI ESG       \n     Score.                                   \n                                              \nUNGC scores provided by Arabesque implement\nquantitative models and data to arrive at a\ncompany score based on the normative\nprinciples of the UNGC: human rights, labor\nrights, the environment, and anti-corruption.\nS&P DJI ESG Scores are assigned by SAM, an ESG\nscoring business unit of S&P Global Inc. (an\naffiliate of the Index Provider (defined\nbelow)), using its Corporate Sustainability\nAssessment, which is an annual evaluation of a\ncompany, based on ESG factors that SAM\ndetermines are financially material to the\ncompany, relative to its industry peer\ncompanies as determined by SAM. After\nimplementing the exclusion criteria described\nabove, the remaining companies are then ranked\nbased on their S&P DJI ESG Score. For each\nGICS industry group, companies are selected\nfor inclusion in the Index primarily in\ndecreasing order of S&P DJI ESG Score until\napproximately 75% of the float adjusted market\ncapitalization of the industry group is\nreached. The Index is float-adjusted market\ncapitalization weighted. The Index is\nreconstituted and rebalanced annually on the\nlast business day in April. In addition,\nbetween Index rebalances, Index constituents\nmay be removed from the Index for their\ninvolvement in economic crime and corruption,\nfraud, illegal commercial practices, human\nrights abuses, labor disputes, workplace\nsafety catastrophic accidents, environmental\ndisasters, and certain other activities\nassociated with environmental, social and\ngovernance risks. Any companies removed from\nthe Index on account of such activities are\nnot eligible for inclusion in the Index until\none full calendar year from the next\nrebalancing of the Index. As of July 31, 2020,\na significant portion of the Fund comprised\ncompanies in the technology sector, although\nthis may change from time to time. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index comprised 310 stocks. The\nIndex is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the\nFund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund\nShares will change in value, and you could\nlose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely\n\n98\n\nTable of Contents affect global economies and\nmarkets. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market\nprices of equity securities owned by the Fund\nmay go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The value of a security may\ndecline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may\ndecline due to general industry or market\nconditions that are not specifically related\nto a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to fall over short or\nextended periods of time. ESG Investing Risk:\nThe Index's incorporation of ESG\nconsiderations in its methodology may cause\nthe Fund to make different investments than\nfunds that do not incorporate such\nconsiderations in their strategy or investment\nprocesses. Under certain economic conditions,\nthis could cause the Fund's investment\nperformance to be worse than funds that do not\nincorporate such considerations. The Index's\nincorporation of ESG considerations may affect\nthe Fund's exposure to certain sectors and/or\ntypes of investments, and may adversely impact\nthe Fund's performance depending on whether\nsuch sectors or investments are in or out of\nfavor in the market. Large-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk: Returns on investments in\nsecurities of large companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of\nsmaller and mid-sized companies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable to respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in\nbusiness, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able\nto maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-\nsized companies. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares\nmay be bought and sold in the secondary market\nat market prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be subject to credit risk\nwith respect to the counterparties with which\nthe Fund enters into derivatives contracts,\nrepurchase agreements, reverse repurchase\nagreements, and other transactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund may be unable to\nterminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, or to recover\ncollateral posted to the counterparty,\nresulting in a loss to the Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral posted by its counterparty,\nit may be delayed or prevented from realizing\non the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Derivatives Risk: Derivative\ntransactions can create investment leverage\nand may have significant volatility. It is\npossible that a derivative transaction will\nresult in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may\nnot be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price. The\ncounterparty to a derivatives contract may be\nunable or unwilling to make timely settlement\npayments, return the Fund's margin, or\notherwise honor its obligations. A derivatives\ntransaction may not behave in the manner\nanticipated by the Adviser or may not have the\neffect on the Fund anticipated by the Adviser.\nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance\nof an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed\nusing an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will\naffect the performance, volatility, and risk\nof the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nWhen there are changes made to the component\nsecurities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities\nholdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its\nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income\ntax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance of the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's return may not match the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, generally as a result\nof cash flows into or out of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held by the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in\nsome securities not included in the Index,\npotentially increasing the risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's return and that of the\nIndex. 99 Table of Contents Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an advantageous time or\nprice or at all. Illiquid securities may trade\nat a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may limit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid\nsecurities and/or the difficulty in purchasing\nand selling such investments, may be unable to\nachieve its desired level of exposure to a\ncertain market or sector. New Fund Risk: The\nFund is new and there is no assurance that the\nFund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size\nis small, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume, which could lead to wider bid/ask\nspreads. In addition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if the Fund does not\nmeet certain conditions of the listing\nexchange. Any resulting liquidation of the\nFund could cause elevated transaction costs\nfor the Fund and negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Non-Diversification Risk: To\nthe extent the Fund becomes \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d\nthe Fund may hold a smaller number of\nportfolio securities than many other funds. To\nthe extent the Fund invests in a relatively\nsmall number of issuers, a decline in the\nmarket value of a particular security held by\nthe Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. The Fund may become non-diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of changes\nin the composition of the Index (e.g., changes\nin weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Technology Sector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major\neffect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies\nand companies that rely heavily on technology\nis particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from\nforeign competitors with lower production\ncosts. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual\nproperty rights, the loss or impairment of\nwhich may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology\nsector may face dramatic and often\nunpredictable changes in growth rates and\ncompetition for the services of qualified\npersonnel. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets\nwithin one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to\ntime. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential\nfor volatility and the risk that events\nnegatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially\ncausing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly. Fund\nPerformance The Fund has not yet completed a\nfull calendar year of operations and therefore\ndoes not have any performance history. Once\nthe Fund has completed a full calendar year of\noperations, a bar chart and table will be\nincluded that will provide some indication of\nthe risks of investing in the Fund by showing\nthe variability of the Fund's returns based on\nnet assets and comparing the Fund's\nperformance to the Index.Updated performance\ninformation may be obtained by calling\n1-866-787-2257or visiting the Fund's website:\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Portfolio\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to the Fund.\nPortfolio Managers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Emiliano Rabinovich, Karl\nSchneider and Olga Winner. Emiliano\nRabinovich, CFA, is a Managing Director of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 2006. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is\na Managing Director of the Adviser and Deputy\nHead of Global Equity Beta Solutions in the\nAmericas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Olga\nWinner, CFA, is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions Group. She joined\nthe Adviser in 2007. 100 Table of Contents\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n101 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 500 \u00aeFossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free  \n  ETF                                         \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment    \n  results                                     \n  that, before fees and expenses, correspond  \n  generally to the total return performance   \n  of the                                      \n  S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Free Index.             \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d   \n     or \u201cAdviser\u201d) has contractually agreed   \n     to waive a portion of its management     \n     fee and/or reimburse certain expenses,   \n     until October 31, 2021, so that the net  \n     annual Fund operating expenses, before   \n     application of any fees and expenses     \n     not paid by the Adviser pursuant to the  \n     Investment Advisory Agreement, if any,   \n     are limited to 0.20% of the Fund's       \n     average daily net assets. The            \n     contractual fee waiver and/or            \n     reimbursement does not provide for the   \n     recoupment by the Adviser of any fees    \n     the Adviser previously waived. The       \n     Adviser may continue the waiver and/or   \n     reimbursement from year to year, but     \n     there is no guarantee that the Adviser   \n     will do so and the waiver and/or         \n     reimbursement may be cancelled or        \n     modified at any time after October 31,   \n     2021.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. The Example reflects the Fund's\ncontractual fee waiver and/or expense\nreimbursement only in the periods for which\nthe contractual fee waiver and/or expense\nreimbursement is expected to continue.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions your costs\nwould be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $75    $136     $313  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 4%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n500 Fossil Fuel Free\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex\n\n102\n\nTable of Contents in\napproximately the same\nproportions as the\nIndex, as determined\nby the Adviser to be\nin the best interest\nof the Fund in\npursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index (including\ncommon stock,\npreferred stock,\ndepositary receipts\nand shares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is designed\nto measure the\nperformance of\ncompanies in the S&P\n500 Index that are\n\u201cfossil fuel free\u201d,\nwhich are defined as\ncompanies that do not\nown fossil fuel\nreserves (either\nproven or probable).\nFor purposes of the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, fossil fuel\nreserves are defined\nas (i) thermal coal\nreserves, (ii) other\nnon-metallurgical coal\nreserves (e.g., coal\nfor chemical\nbiproducts, coal\nbriquettes,\nresidential use,\nliquid fuel, cement\nproduction, paper\nmanufacturing,\npharmaceutical,\nalumina refineries,\nferrochrome,\nanthracite) (iii)\nconventional or\nunconventional oil\nreserves (e.g.,\nnatural gas liquids,\noil sands, condensates\nand liquid petroleum\ngas), (iv) natural gas\nreserves, (v) shale\ngas reserves, and (vi)\noil and gas reserves\nthat have not been\ndisclosed\ntransparently as\nspecific types of oil\nor gas, or are\ndisclosed as one\naggregate quantity of\noil and gas reserves\ncombined. The Index is\na subset of the S&P\n500 Index (the\n\u201cUnderlying Index\u201d),\nwhich serves as the\ninitial universe of\neligible securities\nfor the Index. The\nUnderlying Index\nfocuses on the large\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity market,\nincluding common stock\nand real estate\ninvestment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d). The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P 500 Index\nincludes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American,\nNASDAQ Global Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Investors\nExchange (IEX), Cboe\nBZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe\nEDGA, or Cboe EDGX\nwith unadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $8.2 billion and\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $4.1 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThe minimum required\ncapitalization may be\nrevised by the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) at any time. In\nconstructing the\nIndex, the initial\nuniverse is screened\nin an effort to\nexclude companies with\nany ownership of\nfossil fuel reserves,\nincluding for third-\nparty and in-house\npower generation, as\ndetermined by publicly\navailable information,\nsuch as annual reports\nand other company\npublications. The\nIndex is weighted by\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nquarterly after the\nclose of business on\nthe third Friday of\nMarch, June,\nSeptember, and\nDecember. The\nrebalancing reference\ndates are after the\nclose of the third\nFriday of February,\nMay, August, and\nNovember,\nrespectively. New\nadditions to the\nUnderlying Index are\nreviewed for inclusion\nin the Index each\nquarter, provided they\nhave been added to the\nUnderlying Index by\nthe Index rebalancing\nreference dates.\nFossil fuel reserve\nownership information\nis updated as part of\neach quarterly\nrebalancing. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 487 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. 103\nTable of Contents\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Fossil Fuel\nReserves Free\nOwnership Risk: The\nlack of ownership of\nfossil fuel reserves\nmay potentially have\nan adverse effect on a\ncompany's\nprofitability. The\nreturns on a portfolio\nof securities that\nseeks to exclude\ncompanies that own\nfossil fuel reserves\nmay trail the returns\non a portfolio of\nsecurities that\nincludes companies\nthat own fossil fuel\nreserves. Investing in\na portfolio of\nsecurities of\ncompanies that do not\nown fossil fuel\nreserves may affect\nthe Fund's exposure to\ncertain types of\ninvestments and may\nimpact the Fund's\nrelative investment\nperformance depending\non whether such\ninvestments are in or\nout of favor in the\nmarket. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the 104\nTable of Contents\n\nability of the Fund to\nobtain cash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Michael Feehily, Karl Schneider\nand John Law. Michael Feehily, CFA, is a\nSenior Managing Director of the Adviser and\nthe Head of Global Equity Beta Solutions in\nthe Americas. He worked at the Adviser from\n1997 to 2006 and rejoined in 2010. Karl\nSchneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the\nAdviser and Deputy Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He joined the\nAdviser in 1997. John Law, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2016. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n106 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 600 Small Cap ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF (the         \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks                               \n  to provide investment results that, before  \n  fees                                        \n  and expenses, correspond generally to the   \n  total                                       \n  return performance of an index that tracks  \n  the                                         \n  performance of small capitalization         \n  exchange                                    \n  traded U.S. equity securities.              \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.15%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 15%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n107\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index measures the\nperformance of the\nsmall-capitalization\nsegment of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nselection universe for\nthe Index includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX with\nunadjusted market\ncapitalizations\nbetween $600 million\nand $2.4 billion and\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $300 million at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThese capitalization\nranges may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive\naggregate earnings\nover the four most\nrecent quarters and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. In selecting\nsecurities for\ninclusion in the\nIndex, the Index\nProvider also\nconsiders sector\nbalance by comparing\nthe weight of each\nGICS (Global Industry\nClassification\nStandard) sector in\nthe Index to its\nweight in the relevant\nmarket capitalization\nrange of the S&P Total\nMarket Index. The\nIndex is float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization\nweighted. Index\nconstituents are added\nand removed on an as-\nneeded basis. The\nIndex is rebalanced on\na quarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nconsumer\ndiscretionary,\nindustrial and\nfinancial sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 601 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines. 108\n\nTable of Contents\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na 109 Table of\nContents\n\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective December 17, 2010 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the 110\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFund's benchmark index changed from the Dow\nJones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index\n(the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index, consistent with a change\nin the Fund's principal investment strategy to\ntrack the performance of the current index.\nPerformance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark\nIndex Change Date is therefore based on the\nFund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index.\n                                              \n                OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return        22.63%   9.47%      13.32%    \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      22.14%   8.67%      12.57%    \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  13.59%   7.24%      10.91%    \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  1             22.78%   9.56%      13.49%    \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction     31.49%   11.70%     13.56%    \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Mark Krivitsky. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Mark Krivitsky\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group and the Tax-Efficient\nMarket Capture Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1996. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 50%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Growth\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n112\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index measures the\nperformance of the\nsmall-capitalization\ngrowth segment of the\nU.S. equity market.\nThe Index consists of\nthose stocks in the\nS&P SmallCap 600 Index\nexhibiting the\nstrongest growth\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) sales growth;\n(ii) earnings change\nto price; and (iii)\nmomentum. The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX with market\ncapitalizations\nbetween $600 million\nand $2.4 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThis capitalization\nrange may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the\nsum of earnings over\nthose quarters) and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and\nrebalanced annually on\nthe third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nconsumer\ndiscretionary,\ntechnology and\nindustrial sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 338 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Growth\nStock Risk: The prices\nof growth stocks may\nbe based largely on\nexpectations of future\nearnings, and their\nprices can decline\nrapidly and\nsignificantly in\nreaction to negative\nnews. Growth stocks\nmay underperform value\nstocks and stocks in\nother broad style\ncategories (and the\nstock market as a\nwhole) over any period\nof time and may shift\nin and out of favor\nwith investors\ngenerally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on\nchanges in market,\neconomic, and other\nfactors. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times 113 Table\nof Contents when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations 114\nTable of Contents\n\non investments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performanc e The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective December 17, 2010 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Dow Jones\nU.S. Small-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index\n(the \u201cPrevious 115 Table of Contents Benchmark\nIndex\u201d) to the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth Index,\nconsistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and David Chin. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. David Chin is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1999. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 51%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Value\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n117\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index measures the\nperformance of the\nsmall-capitalization\nvalue segment of the\nU.S. equity market.\nThe Index consists of\nthose stocks in the\nS&P SmallCap 600 Index\nexhibiting the\nstrongest value\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) book value to\nprice ratio; (ii)\nearnings to price\nratio; and (iii) sales\nto price ratio. The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX with market\ncapitalizations\nbetween $600 million\nand $2.4 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThe capitalization\nrange may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 50%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the\nsum of earnings over\nthose quarters) and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and\nrebalanced annually on\nthe third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial, industrial\nand consumer\ndiscretionary sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 450 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Value Stock\nRisk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style\nof investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times 118\n\nTable of Contents when\nthe market price of\nthe shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value\nper share (discount).\nThis risk is\nheightened in times of\nmarket volatility or\nperiods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 119 Table of\nContents Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\n\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Your actual after-tax returns\nwill depend on your specific tax situation and\nmay differ from those shown below. After-tax\nreturns are not relevant to investors who hold\nFund Shares through tax-advantaged\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before\ntaxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a\nshareholder from realizing a capital loss on a\nsale of Fund Shares. Effective December 17,\n2010 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the\nFund's benchmark index changed from the Dow\nJones U.S. Small-Cap Value Total Stock Market\nIndex (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the\nS&P SmallCap 600 Value Index, consistent with\na change in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of the\ncurrent index. Performance of the Fund prior\nto the Benchmark Index Change Date is\ntherefore based on the Fund's investment\nstrategy to track the Previous Benchmark\nIndex.\n                                              \n                OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return        24.31%   8.13%      12.31%    \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      23.69%   6.89%      11.21%    \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  14.62%   5.92%      9.81%     \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  1             24.54%   8.26%      12.54%    \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction     31.49%   11.70%     13.56%    \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and David Chin. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. David Chin is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1999. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. 121 Table of Contents\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 28% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nAerospace & Defense\nSelect Industry Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 123 Table of\nContents\n\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\naerospace and defense\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\naerospace & defense\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the Aerospace\n& Defense sub-industry.\nThe Index is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the performance\nof a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of\nsub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Aerospace &\nDefense sub-industry\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i)\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 31 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nAerospace and Defense\nCompanies Risk:\nAerospace and defense\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby government aerospace\nand defense regulation\nand spending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely to a\nsignificant extent on\nU.S. (and other)\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. 12 4 Table of\nContents Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations 12 5\nTable of Contents on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past performance\n(before and after\ntaxes) is not\nnecessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance information\nis available by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/sp\ndrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 17.76% ( Q4,\n2013)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 20.51% ( Q4,\n2018)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was -19.43%.         \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\n\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n12 7 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Bank ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks    \n  to                                          \n  provide investment results that, before     \n  fees and                                    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  total return                                \n  performance of an index that tracks the     \n  performance of publicly traded national     \n  money                                       \n  centers and leading regional banks.         \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 30%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nBanks Select Industry\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n12 8\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index represents\nthe banks segment of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nbanks segment of the\nS&P TMI comprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries: Asset\nManagement & Custody\nBanks, Diversified\nBanks, Regional Banks,\nOther Diversified\nFinancial Services,\nand Thrifts & Mortgage\nFinance. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the Asset\nManagement & Custody\nBanks, Diversified\nBanks, Regional Banks,\nOther Diversified\nFinancial Services,\nand Thrifts & Mortgage\nFinance sub-industries\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria:\n(i) have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization above\n$2 billion with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) above\n100%; and (ii) are\nU.S. based companies.\nThe length of time to\nevaluate liquidity is\nreduced to the\navailable trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $1 billion or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions.\nRebalancing occurs on\nthe third Friday of\nthe quarter ending\nmonth. The S&P TMI\ntracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX exchanges.\nThe Index is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, the\nIndex comprised 86\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Banking\nCompanies Risk: The\nperformance of bank\nstocks may be affected\nby extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, and the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds,\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers can\nnegatively impact\nbanking companies.\nBanks may also be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nCompetition is high\namong banking\ncompanies and failure\nto maintain or\nincrease market share\nmay result in lost\nmarket value. 12 9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFinancial Institutions\nRisk: Changes in the\ncreditworthiness of\nfinancial institutions\n(such as banks and\nbroker-dealers) may\nadversely affect the\nvalues of instruments\nof issuers in\nfinancial industries.\nAdverse developments\nin banking and other\nfinancial industries\nmay cause the Fund to\nunderperform relative\nto other funds that\ninvest more broadly\nacross different\nindustries or have a\nsmaller exposure to\nfinancial\ninstitutions. Changes\nin governmental\nregulation and\noversight of financial\ninstitutions may have\nan adverse effect on\nthe financial\ncondition of a\nfinancial institution.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more 130\nTable of Contents\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective October 24, 2011 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the KBW Bank\nIndex (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the\nS&P Banks Select Industry Index, consistent\nwith a change in the Fund's principal\ninvestment strategy to track the performance\nof the current index.

Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you.\n\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or\nvisit your financial intermediary's website\nfor more information. 132 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Biotech ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)       \n  seeks to                                    \n  provide investment results that, before     \n  fees and                                    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  total return                                \n  performance of an index derived from the    \n  biotechnology segment of a U.S. total       \n  market                                      \n  composite index.                            \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 66% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nBiotechnology Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 13 3\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\nbiotechnology segment\nof the S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nbiotechnology segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nBiotechnology sub-\nindustry. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Biotechnology\nsub-industry that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. If\nthere are fewer than 35\nstocks, stocks from the\nLife Sciences Tools &\nServices sub-industry\nthat meet the market\ncapitalization and\nliquidity thresholds\nare included in order\nof their float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month.

The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 132 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nBiotechnology Companies\nRisk: Biotech companies\ninvest heavily in\nresearch and\ndevelopment which may\nnot necessarily lead to\ncommercially successful\nproducts. These\ncompanies are also\nsubject to increased\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may delay or\ninhibit the release of\nnew products. Many\nbiotech companies are\ndependent upon their\nability to use and\nenforce intellectual\nproperty rights and\npatents. Any impairment\nof such rights may have\nadverse financial\nconsequences. Biotech\nstocks, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market. Biotech\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby technological change\nand obsolescence,\nproduct liability\nlawsuits and\nconsequential high\ninsurance costs. 13 4\nTable of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Health Care\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the health care\nsector are subject to\nextensive government\nregulation and their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of medical\nproducts and services,\npricing pressure\n(including price\ndiscounting), limited\nproduct lines and an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of\nhealthcare through\noutpatient services.\nCompanies in the health\ncare sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining\nand defending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in technologies\nor other market\ndevelopments. Many new\nproducts in the health\ncare sector require\nsignificant research\nand development and may\nbe subject to\nregulatory approvals,\nall of which may be\ntime consuming and\ncostly with no\nguarantee that any\nproduct will come to\nmarket. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations 135\nTable of Contents on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index .

Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs.\n\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income,\nqualified dividend income and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or\nvisit your financial intermediary's website\nfor more information. 13 7 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Capital Markets ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Capital Markets ETF (the       \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of an index that   \n  tracks                                      \n  the performance of publicly traded          \n  companies that                              \n  do business as broker-dealers, asset        \n  managers,                                   \n  trust and custody banks or exchanges.       \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 20% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nCapital Markets Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 13 8\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the capital\nmarkets segment of the\nS&P Total Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\ncapital markets segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the following\nsub-industries: Asset\nManagement & Custody\nBanks, Diversified\nCapital Markets,\nFinancial Exchanges &\nData, and Investment\nBanking & Brokerage.\nThe Index is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the performance\nof a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of\nsub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Asset Management\n& Custody Banks,\nDiversified Capital\nMarkets, Financial\nExchanges & Data, and\nInvestment Banking &\nBrokerage sub-\nindustries that satisfy\nthe following criteria:\n(i) have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 58 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nCapital Markets\nCompanies Risk: Capital\nMarkets companies may\nbe significantly\naffected by stock and\nbank trading activity,\nchanges in governmental\nregulation, continuing\nincreases in price\ncompetition, decreases\nin fees or fee-related\nbusiness, including\ninvestment banking,\nbrokerage, asset\nmanagement and other\nservicing fees,\nfluctuation in interest\nrates and other factors\nwhich could adversely\naffect financial\nmarkets. 13 9 Table of\nContents Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 140 Table of\nContents Liquidity\nRisk: Lack of a ready\nmarket or restrictions\non resale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past performance\n(before and after\ntaxes) is not\nnecessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance information\nis available by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/sp\ndrs .\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 21.90% ( Q1,\n2012)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 26.98% ( Q3,\n2011)\n     \n  *  \n     \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes. Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective October 24, 2011 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the KBW Capital\nMarkets Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d)\nto the S&P Capital Markets Select Industry\nIndex, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index. Performance\nof the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index\nChange Date is therefore based on the Fund's\ninvestment strategy to track the Previous\nBenchmark Index.\n                                              \n                OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return        27.13%   5.73%      7.41%     \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      26.39%   5.08%      6.80%     \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  16.52%   4.32%      5.83%     \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  1             27.13%   5.92%      7.68%     \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction     31.49%   11.70%     13.56%    \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.

Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n142 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Dividend ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)      \n  seeks to                                    \n  provide investment results that, before     \n  fees and                                    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  total return                                \n  performance of an index that tracks the     \n  performance of publicly traded issuers      \n  that have                                   \n  historically followed a policy of making    \n  dividend                                    \n  payments.                                   \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 31% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nHigh Yield Dividend\nAristocrats Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 143 Table of\nContents\n\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\nhighest dividend\nyielding S&P Composite\n1500 \u00aeIndex\nconstituents that have\nfollowed a managed-\ndividends policy of\nconsistently increasing\ndividends every year\nfor at least 20\nconsecutive years.\nStocks included in the\nIndex have both capital\ngrowth and dividend\nincome characteristics,\nas opposed to stocks\nthat are pure yield, or\npure capital oriented,\nand must meet minimum\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization and\nliquidity requirements.\nStocks within the Index\nare weighted by\nindicated yield\n(annualized gross\ndividend payment per\nshare divided by price\nper share) and weight-\nadjusted each quarter.\nThe Index components\nare reviewed annually\nin January for\ncontinued inclusion in\nthe Index and re-\nweighted quarterly\nafter the closing of\nthe last business day\nof January, April, July\nand October. If between\nannual reviews the\nIndex Provider (as\ndefined below)\ndetermines, based on\npublicly available\ninformation, that an\nIndex constituent has\neliminated or suspended\nits dividend, omitted a\npayment, or reduced its\ncalendar year dividend\namount and will no\nlonger qualify for the\nIndex at the subsequent\nreconstitution, the\nIndex constituent will\nbe removed from the\nindex effective prior\nto the open of the\nfirst business day of\nthe following month. As\nof July 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nindustrial and energy\nsectors, although this\nmay change from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 117 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nDividend Paying\nSecurities Risk:\nSecurities that pay\ndividends, as a group,\ncan fall out of favor\nwith the market,\ncausing such companies\nto underperform\ncompanies that do not\npay dividends. In\naddition, changes in\nthe dividend policies\nof the companies held\nby the Fund or the\ncapital resources\navailable for such\ncompany's dividend\npayments may adversely\naffect the Fund.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty. 144 Table\nof Contents Derivatives\nRisk: Derivative\ntransactions can create\ninvestment leverage and\nmay have significant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Energy Sector\nRisk: Issuers in\nenergy-related\nindustries can be\nsignificantly affected\nby fluctuations in\nenergy prices and\nsupply and demand of\nenergy fuels. Markets\nfor various energy-\nrelated commodities can\nhave significant\nvolatility, and are\nsubject to control or\nmanipulation by large\nproducers or\npurchasers. Companies\nin the energy sector\nmay need to make\nsubstantial\nexpenditures, and to\nincur significant\namounts of debt, in\norder to maintain or\nexpand their reserves.\nOil and gas exploration\nand production can be\nsignificantly affected\nby natural disasters as\nwell as changes in\nexchange rates,\ninterest rates,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions.\nThese companies may be\nat risk for\nenvironmental damage\nclaims. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). 145 Table\nof Contents\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n14 7 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Health Care Equipment ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF      \n  (the                                        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment         \n  results that,                               \n  before fees and expenses, correspond        \n  generally to                                \n  the total return performance of an index    \n  derived                                     \n  from the health care equipment and          \n  supplies                                    \n  segment of a U.S. total market composite    \n  index.                                      \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 25% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nHealth Care Equipment\nSelect Industry Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 148 Table of\nContents\n\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the health\ncare equipment segment\nof the S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nhealth care equipment\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the following\nsub-industries: Health\nCare Equipment and\nHealth Care Supplies.\nThe Index is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the performance\nof a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of\nsub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Health Care\nEquipment and Health\nCare Services sub-\nindustries that satisfy\nthe following criteria:\n(i) have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 72 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Health\nCare Equipment\nCompanies Risk: Health\ncare equipment\ncompanies are affected\nby rising costs of\nmedical products,\ndevices and services\nand the increased\nemphasis on the\ndelivery of health care\nthrough outpatient\nservices. Competition\namong health care\nequipment companies is\nhigh and can be\nsignificantly affected\nby extensive government\nregulation or\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses. The\nequipment may be\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nmalpractice claims,\nproduct liability\nclaims or other\nlitigation. Medical\nequipment manufacturers\nare heavily dependent\non patent protection\nand the expiration of\npatents may adversely\naffect their\nprofitability. Many new\nhealth care products\nare subject to the\napproval of the U.S.\nFood and Drug\nAdministration (\u201cFDA\u201d).\nThe process of\nobtaining FDA approval\nis often long and\nexpensive. 149 Table of\nContents Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Health Care\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the health care\nsector are subject to\nextensive government\nregulation and their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of medical\nproducts and services,\npricing pressure\n(including price\ndiscounting), limited\nproduct lines and an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of\nhealthcare through\noutpatient services.\nCompanies in the health\ncare sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining\nand defending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in technologies\nor other market\ndevelopments. Many new\nproducts in the health\ncare sector require\nsignificant research\nand development and may\nbe subject to\nregulatory approvals,\nall of which may be\ntime consuming and\ncostly with no\nguarantee that any\nproduct will come to\nmarket. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations 150\nTable of Contents on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                              \n             OneYear  FiveYears  Since        \n                                 Inception(\u2026  \n  Return                                      \n  Before     22.39%   16.34%     16.31%       \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return                                      \n  After      22.37%   15.83%     15.87%       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribu\u2026                                   \n  Return                                      \n  After                                       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribu\u2026  13.26%   13.00%     13.57%       \n  and Sale                                    \n  of Fund                                     \n  Shares                                      \n  S&P                                         \n  Health                                      \n  Care                                        \n  Equipment                                   \n  Select                                      \n  Industry                                    \n  Index      22.72%   16.68%     16.67%       \n  (reflects                                   \n  no                                          \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses                                    \n  or taxes)                                   \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects                                   \n  no         31.49%   11.70%     13.11%       \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses                                    \n  or taxes)                                   \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Kala O'Donnell. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Kala O'Donnell\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group. She joined the Adviser\nin 1995. 151 Table of Contents\n\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n152 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Health Care Services ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF (the  \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of an index        \n  derived from                                \n  the health care providers and services      \n  segment of                                  \n  a U.S. total market composite index.        \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 25% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nHealth Care Services\nSelect Industry Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 153 Table of\nContents\n\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the health\ncare services segment\nof the S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nhealth care services\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the following\nsub-industries: Health\nCare Distributors,\nHealth Care Facilities,\nHealth Care Services,\nand Managed Health\nCare. The Index is one\nof twenty-one (21) of\nthe S&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the performance\nof a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of\nsub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Health Care\nDistributors, Health\nCare Facilities, Health\nCare Services, and\nManaged Health Care\nsub-industries that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 48 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Health\nCare Services Companies\nRisk: Health care\nservices companies are\naffected by rising\ncosts of medical\nproducts, devices and\nservices and the\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of health\ncare through outpatient\nservices. Competition\nis high among health\ncare services companies\nand can be\nsignificantly affected\nby extensive government\nregulation or\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses. The\nequipment may be\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nmalpractice claims,\nproduct liability\nclaims or other\nlitigation. Medical\nequipment manufacturers\nare heavily dependent\non patent protection\nand the expiration of\npatents may adversely\naffect their\nprofitability. Many new\nhealth care products\nare subject to the\napproval of the U.S.\nFood and Drug\nAdministration (\u201cFDA\u201d).\nThe process of\nobtaining FDA approval\nis often long and\nexpensive. 154 Table of\nContents Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Health Care\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the health care\nsector are subject to\nextensive government\nregulation and their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of medical\nproducts and services,\npricing pressure\n(including price\ndiscounting), limited\nproduct lines and an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of\nhealthcare through\noutpatient services.\nCompanies in the health\ncare sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining\nand defending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in technologies\nor other market\ndevelopments. Many new\nproducts in the health\ncare sector require\nsignificant research\nand development and may\nbe subject to\nregulatory approvals,\nall of which may be\ntime consuming and\ncostly with no\nguarantee that any\nproduct will come to\nmarket. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations 155\nTable of Contents on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 27% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nHomebuilders Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 158 Table of\nContents\n\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\nhomebuilders segment of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nhomebuilders segment of\nthe S&P TMI comprises\nthe Homebuilding sub-\nindustry. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Homebuilding\nsub-industry that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. If\nthere are fewer than 35\nstocks, stocks from the\nBuilding Products, Home\nFurnishings, Home\nImprovement Retail,\nHomefurnishing Retail,\nor Household Appliances\nsub-industries that\nmeet the market\ncapitalization and\nliquidity thresholds\nare included in order\nof their float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions.

Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nHomebuilding Companies\nRisk: Homebuilding\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby the national,\nregional and local real\nestate markets. This\nindustry is also\nsensitive to interest\nrate fluctuations which\ncan cause changes in\nthe availability of\nmortgage capital and\ndirectly affect the\npurchasing power of\npotential homebuyers.\nThe building industry\ncan be significantly\naffected by changes in\ngovernment spending,\nconsumer confidence,\ndemographic patterns\nand the level of new\nand existing home\nsales. 159 Table of\nContents Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily\non disposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. Also,\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on their\nrespective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\n160 Table of Contents\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Retail\nCompanies Risk: Retail\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby the performance of\nthe domestic and\ninternational economy,\nconsumer confidence and\nspending, intense\ncompetition, changes in\ndemographics, and\nchanging consumer\ntastes and preferences.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Raymond Donofrio. 161 Table\nof Contents Michael Feehily, CFA, is a Senior\nManaging Director of the Adviser and the Head\nof Global Equity Beta Solutions in the\nAmericas. He worked at the Adviser from 1997\nto 2006 and rejoined in 2010. Karl Schneider,\nCAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser\nand Deputy Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He joined the\nAdviser in 1997. Raymond Donofrio is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2008. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n162 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Insurance ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)     \n  seeks to                                    \n  provide investment results that, before     \n  fees and                                    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  total return                                \n  performance of an index that tracks the     \n  performance of publicly traded companies    \n  in the                                      \n  insurance industry.                         \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 19% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nInsurance Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 163\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\ninsurance segment of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\ninsurance segment of\nthe S&P TMI comprises\nthe following sub-\nindustries: Insurance\nBrokers, Life & Health\nInsurance, Multi-Line\nInsurance, Property &\nCasualty Insurance, and\nReinsurance. The Index\nis one of twenty-one\n(21) of the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Insurance\nBrokers, Life & Health\nInsurance, Multi-Line\nInsurance, Property &\nCasualty Insurance, and\nReinsurance sub-\nindustries that satisfy\nthe following criteria:\n(i) have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization above $2\nbillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) above\n90%; and (ii) are U.S.\nbased companies. The\nlength of time to\nevaluate liquidity is\nreduced to the\navailable trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $1 billion or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 51 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nInsurance Companies\nRisk: Insurance\ncompanies' profits are\naffected by many\nfactors, including\ninterest rate\nmovements, the\nimposition of premium\nrate caps, competition\nand pressure to compete\nglobally. Certain types\nof insurance companies\nmay also be affected by\nweather catastrophes\nand other disasters and\nmortality rates. In\naddition, although\ninsurance companies are\ncurrently subject to\nextensive regulation,\nsuch companies may be\nadversely affected by\nincreased governmental\nregulations or tax law\nchanges in the future.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\n164 Table of Contents\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the 165 Table of\nContents ability of the\nFund to obtain cash to\nmeet redemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past performance\n(before and after\ntaxes) is not\nnecessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance information\nis available by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website at\nhttps\n://www.ssga.com/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 19.16% ( Q1,\n2010)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 23.22% ( Q3,\n2011)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was -19.67%.         \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Raymond Donofrio. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. 166 Table of Contents Karl Schneider,\nCAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser\nand Deputy Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 57% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nInternet Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 16 8\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the internet\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\ninternet segment of the\nS&P TMI comprises the\nInternet & Direct\nMarketing Retail,\nInternet Services &\nInfrastructure, and\nInteractive Media &\nServices sub-\nindustries. The Index\nis one of twenty-one\n(21) of the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Internet &\nDirect Marketing\nRetail, Internet\nServices &\nInfrastructure, and\nInteractive Media &\nServices sub-industries\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i)\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges.

As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 43 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nInternet Segment Risk:\nInternet companies are\nsubject to rapid\nchanges in technology,\nworldwide competition,\nrapid obsolescence of\nproducts and services,\nloss of patent\nprotections, cyclical\nmarket patterns,\nevolving industry\nstandards and frequent\nnew product\nintroductions.\nCompetitive pressures,\nsuch as technological\ndevelopments, fixed-\nrate pricing and the\nability to attract and\nretain skilled\nemployees, can\nsignificantly affect\ninternet companies, and\nchanging domestic and\ninternational demand,\nresearch and\ndevelopment costs,\navailability and price\ncomponents and product\nobsolescence also can\naffect their\nprofitability. 169\nTable of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Communication\nServices Sector Risk:\nCommunication services\ncompanies are\nparticularly vulnerable\nto the potential\nobsolescence of\nproducts and services\ndue to technological\nadvancement and the\ninnovation of\ncompetitors. Companies\nin the communication\nservices sector may\nalso be affected by\nother competitive\npressures, such as\npricing competition, as\nwell as research and\ndevelopment costs,\nsubstantial capital\nrequirements and\ngovernment regulation.\nAdditionally,\nfluctuating domestic\nand international\ndemand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes\nin consumer tastes can\ndrastically affect a\ncommunication services\ncompany's\nprofitability. While\nall companies may be\nsusceptible to network\nsecurity breaches,\ncertain companies in\nthe communication\nservices sector may be\nparticular targets of\nhacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or\nconsumer information or\ndisruptions in service,\nwhich could have a\nmaterial adverse effect\non their businesses.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business, and\nother developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily\non disposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. Also,\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on their\nrespective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 170 Table of\nContents Liquidity\nRisk: Lack of a ready\nmarket or restrictions\non resale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Michael Feehily, CFA, is a Senior\nManaging Director of the Adviser and the Head\nof Global Equity Beta Solutions in the\nAmericas. He worked at the Adviser from 1997\nto 2006 and rejoined in 2010. Karl Schneider,\nCAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser\nand Deputy Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He joined the\nAdviser in 1997. Raymond Donofrio is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2008. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 37%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho Clean Power\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be\nused by the Fund in\nseeking performance\nthat corresponds to\nthe Index and in\nmanaging cash flows.\n\n173 Table of Contents\n\nThe Index is comprised\nof U.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nof companies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide which are\nincluded in the Clean\nPower sector as\ndetermined by a\nclassification\nstandard produced by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d). The Index\nis designed to capture\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nbehind clean power. In\nparticular, the Index\ncomprises the\ncomponents of the S&P\nKensho Cleantech Index\nand the S&P Kensho\nClean Energy Index\n(the \u201cUnderlying\nIndexes\u201d) as of the\nIndex's semi-annual\nselection date, on the\nfirst Friday in June\nand December, subject\nto the following\nliquidity thresholds\nfor each component:\n(i) must be issued by\na company with a\nminimum float market\ncapitalization of at\nleast $100 million and\n(ii) must have a\nminimum three-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of at least $1\nmillion. The S&P\nKensho Cleantech Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies focused on\nbuilding technologies\nor products that\nenable generation of\nenergy in a clean\nmanner (solar, wind,\nhydro and geothermal).\nThe S&P Kensho Clean\nEnergy Index seeks to\ntrack companies\nfocused on the\ngeneration and\ntransmission of energy\nderived from clean\nsources (solar, wind,\nhydro and geothermal).\nTo determine the\nconstituents of the\nUnderlying Indexes,\nthe Index Provider's\nclassification\nstandard utilizes an\nautomated scan of\ncompanies' most recent\nannual reports filed\nwith the U.S.\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission on\nForm 10-K, Form 20-F,\nForm 40-F, or S-1\nfiling and prospectus,\nas applicable, to\nidentify specific\nsearch terms and\nphrases that describe\na company as producing\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities\nfor each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered\nby eliminating\ncompanies that do not\ninclude in their\nannual reports a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and\n(ii) is used in a\nmanner that is within\nthe scope of the\nUnderlying Index's\nobjective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are\nnot listed on NYSE,\nNASDAQ, IEX, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an\naffiliate of one of\nthose exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining\neligible constituent\nto verify the rules of\nthe automated scan\nwere implemented\ncorrectly. Underlying\nIndex constituents are\nthen categorized as\neither \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is\ncategorized as Core if\nits products and\nservices related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nannual report as\nprincipal components\nof the company's\nstrategy. Products and\nservices are deemed to\nbe principal\ncomponents of a\ncompany's strategy if\nthe company's annual\nreport disclosures\nregarding such\nproducts and services\nare determined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on\nthe frequency and\nposition of such\ndisclosures within an\nannual report. All\nother companies are\ncategorized as Non-\nCore, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain of the\nsegment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index.\nAn Index constituent\ncategorized as Core by\nat least one of the\nUnderlying Indexes\nwill be categorized as\nCore for purposes of\nthe Index. At the time\nof each rebalance, to\ntilt the Index's\nexposure toward Core\nIndex Constituents,\nthe Core Index\nConstituents are\nsystematically\noverweighted relative\nto the Non-Core Index\nConstituents. Each\nCore Index Constituent\nand Non-Core Index\nConstituent is then\nequally weighted\nwithin the group of\nCore Index\nConstituents and Non-\nCore Index\nConstituents,\nrespectively, subject\nto liquidity\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 39\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. 174\n\nTable of Contents\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Clean Power\nCompanies Risk : Clean\npower companies may be\nhighly dependent upon\ngovernment subsidies,\ncontracts with\ngovernment entities,\nand the successful\ndevelopment of new and\nproprietary\ntechnologies. Clean\npower companies may be\naffected by\ncompetition from new\nand existing market\nentrants, obsolescence\nof technology, short\nproduct cycles,\nchanges in exchange\nrates, imposition of\nimport controls, and\ndepletion of\nresources. In\naddition, seasonal\nweather conditions,\nfluctuations in supply\nof and demand for\nclean energy products\nor services, and\ninternational\npolitical events may\ncause fluctuations in\nthe performance of\nclean power companies\nand the prices of\ntheir securities.\nRisks associated with\nfluctuations in energy\nprices and supply and\ndemand of alternative\nenergy fuels, energy\nconservation, the\nsuccess of exploration\nprojects and tax and\nother government\nregulations can\nsignificantly affect\nclean power companies.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In\ngeneral, cyber-attacks\nare deliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may\nresult in material\nadverse consequences\nfor such company, as\nwell as other\ncompanies included in\nthe Index, and may\ncause the Fund's\ninvestments to lose\nvalue. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. 175 Table\nof Contents Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible\ntrade barriers,\ncurrency transfer\nrestrictions, a more\nlimited number of\npotential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew 176 Table of\nContents key\nemployees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nare subject to\npolitical, regulatory,\nand economic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUtilities Sector Risk:\nUtility companies are\naffected by supply and\ndemand, operating\ncosts, government\nregulation,\nenvironmental factors,\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities, and rate\ncaps or rate changes.\nAlthough rate changes\nof a utility usually\nfluctuate in\napproximate\ncorrelation with\nfinancing costs, due\nto political and\nregulatory factors\nrate changes\nordinarily occur only\nfollowing a delay\nafter the changes in\nfinancing costs. This\nfactor will tend to\nfavorably affect a\nregulated utility\ncompany's earnings and\ndividends in times of\ndecreasing costs, but\nconversely, will tend\nto adversely affect\nearnings and dividends\nwhen costs are rising.\nThe value of regulated\nutility debt\nsecurities (and, to a\nlesser extent, equity\nsecurities) may tend\nto have an inverse\nrelationship to the\nmovement of interest\nrates. Certain utility\ncompanies have\nexperienced full or\npartial deregulation\nin recent years. These\nutility companies are\nfrequently more\nsimilar to industrial\ncompanies in that 177\nTable of Contents they\nare subject to greater\ncompetition and have\nbeen permitted by\nregulators to\ndiversify outside of\ntheir original\ngeographic regions and\ntheir traditional\nlines of business.\nThese opportunities\nmay permit certain\nutility companies to\nearn more than their\ntraditional regulated\nrates of return. Some\ncompanies, however,\nmay be forced to\ndefend their core\nbusiness and may be\nless profitable. In\naddition, natural\ndisasters, terrorist\nattacks, government\nintervention or other\nfactors may render a\nutility company's\nequipment unusable or\nobsolete and\nnegatively impact\nprofitability. Among\nthe risks that may\naffect utility\ncompanies are the\nfollowing: risks of\nincreases in fuel and\nother operating costs;\nthe high cost of\nborrowing to finance\ncapital construction\nduring inflationary\nperiods; restrictions\non operations and\nincreased costs and\ndelays associated with\ncompliance with\nenvironmental and\nnuclear safety\nregulations; and the\ndifficulties involved\nin obtaining natural\ngas for resale or fuel\nfor generating\nelectricity at\nreasonable prices.\nOther risks include\nthose related to the\nconstruction and\noperation of nuclear\npower plants, the\neffects of energy\nconservation and the\neffects of regulatory\nchanges. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially\na large portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindicationof the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a pricegreater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.45%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 39% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho Final Frontiers\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n180\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts) of\ncompanies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide which are\nincluded in the Final\nFrontiers sector as\ndetermined by a\nclassification standard\nproduced by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The\nIndex is designed to\ncapture companies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nbehind the exploration\nof deep space and deep\nsea. In particular, the\nIndex comprises the\ncomponents of the S&P\nKensho Space Index and\nthe deep sea\nexploration components\nof the S&P Kensho\nDrones Index (the\n\u201cUnderlying Indexes\u201d)\nas of the Index's semi-\nannual selection date,\non the first Friday in\nJune and December,\nsubject to the\nfollowing liquidity\nthresholds for each\ncomponent: (i) must be\nissued by a company\nwith a minimum float\nmarket capitalization\nof at least $100\nmillion and (ii) must\nhave a minimum three-\nmonth average daily\ntraded value of at\nleast $1 million. The\nS&P Kensho Space Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nthat enable space\ntravel and exploration,\nor are a necessary\ncomponent of the supply\nchain for such products\nand services. The S&P\nKensho Drones Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nremotely-operated or\nunmanned aerial,\nunderwater and surface-\nlevel drones market, or\nare a necessary\ncomponent of the supply\nchain for such products\nand services. To\ndetermine the\nconstituents of the\nUnderlying Indexes, the\nIndex Provider's\nclassification standard\nutilizes an automated\nscan of companies' most\nrecent annual reports\nfiled with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange\nCommission on Form\n10-K, Form 20-F, Form\n40-F, or S-1 filing and\nprospectus, as\napplicable, to identify\nspecific search terms\nand phrases that\ndescribe a company as\nproducing products and\nservices related to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities for\neach Underlying Index\nis then filtered by\neliminating companies\nthat do not include in\ntheir annual reports a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and (ii)\nis used in a manner\nthat is within the\nscope of the Underlying\nIndex's objective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are not\nlisted on NYSE, NASDAQ,\nIEX, or CBOE exchanges\n(or an affiliate of one\nof those exchanges) or\ndo not meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining eligible\nconstituent to verify\nthe rules of the\nautomated scan were\nimplemented correctly.\nUnderlying Index\nconstituents are then\ncategorized as either\n\u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-Core.\u201d A\ncompany is categorized\nas Core if its products\nand services related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nannual report as\nprincipal components of\nthe company's strategy.\nProducts and services\nare deemed to be\nprincipal components of\na company's strategy if\nthe company's annual\nreport disclosures\nregarding such products\nand services are\ndetermined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on the\nfrequency and position\nof such disclosures\nwithin an annual\nreport. All other\ncompanies are\ncategorized as Non-\nCore, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the supply\nchain of the segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. An\nIndex constituent\ncategorized as Core by\nat least one of the\nUnderlying Indexes will\nbe categorized as Core\nfor purposes of the\nIndex. At the time of\neach rebalance, to tilt\nthe Index's exposure\ntoward Core Index\nConstituents, the Core\nIndex Constituents are\nsystematically\noverweighted relative\nto the Non-Core Index\nConstituents. Each Core\nIndex Constituent and\nNon-Core Index\nConstituent is then\nequally weighted within\nthe group of Core Index\nConstituents and Non-\nCore Index\nConstituents,\nrespectively, subject\nto liquidity\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 29\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. 181 Table\nof Contents Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nAerospace and Defense\nCompanies Risk:\nAerospace and defense\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby government aerospace\nand defense regulation\nand spending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely to a\nsignificant extent on\nU.S. (and other)\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Drone\nCompanies Risk: Drone\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets, financial\nresources or personnel\nand are subject to the\nrisks of changes in\nbusiness cycles, world\neconomic growth,\ntechnological progress,\nand government\nregulation. Securities\nof drone companies,\nespecially smaller,\nstart-up companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than\nsecurities of companies\nthat do not rely\nheavily on technology.\nThese companies may\nface intense\ncompetition and\npotentially rapid\nproduct obsolescence.\nIn addition, drone\ncompanies may be\ndependent on the U.S.\ngovernment and its\nagencies for a\nsignificant portion of\ntheir sales, and their\nsuccess and growth may\nbe dependent on their\nability to win future\ngovernment contracts.\nAs a result, such\ncompanies may be\nnegatively affected by\nbudgetary constraints,\nspending reductions,\ncongressional\nappropriations, and\nadministrative\nallocations of funds\nthat affect the U.S.\ngovernment and its\nagencies. Drone\ncompanies may rely on a\ncombination of patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks\nand trade secret laws\nto establish and\nprotect their\nproprietary rights in\ntheir products and\ntechnologies, and may\nbe adversely affected\nby loss or impairment\nof those rights. Legal\nand regulatory changes\nmay have an impact on a\ndrone company's\nproducts or services.\nIn addition, drone\ncompanies may also be\nsubject to increasing\nregulatory constraints\nthat may limit the sale\nor use of a company's\nproducts, including the\nneed to obtain\nregulatory approvals\nfrom certain government\nagencies. Drone\ncompanies typically\nengage in significant\namounts of spending on\nresearch and\ndevelopment, and there\nis no guarantee that\nthe products or\nservices produced by\nthese companies will be\nsuccessful.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In general,\ncyber-attacks are\ndeliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may result\nin material adverse\nconsequences for such\ncompany, as well as\nother companies\nincluded in the Index,\nand may cause the\nFund's investments to\nlose value. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts may\nbe less liquid and more\nvolatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency than\nits underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts may\nhave limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith 182 Table of\nContents respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the issuer\nof the receipts to take\naction. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may\ndiffer from the prices\nof securities upon\nwhich they are based.\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible trade\nbarriers, currency\ntransfer restrictions,\na more limited number\nof potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid, less\ngovernmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques, differences\nin auditing and\nfinancial reporting\nstandards, and less\ndeveloped legal\nsystems. There is also\nthe potential for\nunfavorable action such\nas expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of securities\nof certain companies in\na particular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in the\ncountry or region. The\nFund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions\nin such securities at\nany time, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in frontier\nmarket countries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund\nis managed with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, 183 Table of\nContents product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-sized\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may be volatile.\nNon-Diversification\nRisk: As a \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d fund, the\nFund may hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S.\nentity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security and\nthe last quoted price\nfor the underlying\nsecurity on the closed\nforeign market. These\ndeviations could result\nin the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities\ntraded on foreign\nmarkets may be less\nliquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital\nto the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent\nthat the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated\nin a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks\nsuch as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates\nand the risk that a\nforeign government\ncould regulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant impact\non the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts may\nbe less liquid and more\nvolatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant volatility.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any time,\nor at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet\nthe Fund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily 184 Table\nof Contents dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations. This\nmay occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil\nor reduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

She joined the Adviser in\n2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 25%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho Future Security\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n187\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nof companies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide which are\nincluded in the Future\nSecurity sector as\ndetermined by a\nclassification\nstandard produced by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d). The Index\nis designed to capture\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nbehind future\nsecurity. In\nparticular, the Index\ncomprises the\ncomponents of the S&P\nKensho Cyber Security\nIndex and the S&P\nKensho Smart Borders\nIndex, and the\nmilitary components of\nthe S&P Kensho\nRobotics Index, the\nS&P Kensho Drones\nIndex, the S&P Kensho\nSpace Index, the S&P\nKensho Wearables Index\nand the S&P Kensho\nVirtual Reality Index\n(the \u201cUnderlying\nIndexes\u201d) as of the\nIndex's semi-annual\nselection date, on the\nfirst Friday in June\nand December, subject\nto the following\nliquidity thresholds\nfor each component:\n(i) must be issued by\na company with a\nminimum float market\ncapitalization of at\nleast $100 million and\n(ii) must have a\nminimum three-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of at least $1\nmillion. The S&P\nKensho Cyber Security\nIndex seeks to track\ncompanies that focus\non protecting\nenterprises and\ndevices from\nunauthorized access\nvia electronic means\nand, produce products\nand services that\nprotect enterprises,\nhomes and portable\ndevices from\nunauthorized access\nvia electronic means,\nor are a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain for such\nproducts and services.\nThe S&P Kensho Smart\nBorders Index seeks to\ntrack companies that\nproduce products and\nservices that secure\nborders and critical\ninfrastructure, or are\na necessary component\nof the supply chain\nfor such products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Robotics Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nto build robotic\nproducts and their\nsubsystems, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Drones Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nremotely-operated or\nunmanned aerial,\nunderwater and\nsurface-level drones\nmarket and related\nsubsystems, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Space Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nthat enable space\ntravel and\nexploration, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Wearables Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nrelated to wearable\ntechnologies for\nconsumer, military or\nmedical uses, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Virtual Reality\nIndex seeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nrelated to virtual or\naugmented reality\nactivities, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. To determine\nthe constituents of\nthe Underlying\nIndexes, the Index\nProvider's\nclassification\nstandard utilizes an\nautomated scan of\ncompanies' most recent\nannual reports filed\nwith the U.S.\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission on\nForm 10-K, Form 20-F,\nForm 40-F, or S-1\nfiling and prospectus,\nas applicable, to\nidentify specific\nsearch terms and\nphrases that describe\na company as producing\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities\nfor each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered\nby eliminating\ncompanies that do not\ninclude in their\nannual reports a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and\n(ii) is used in a\nmanner that is within\nthe scope of the\nUnderlying Index's\nobjective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are\nnot listed on NYSE,\nNASDAQ, IEX, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an\naffiliate of one of\nthose exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining\neligible constituent\nto verify the rules of\nthe automated scan\nwere implemented\ncorrectly. Underlying\nIndex constituents are\nthen categorized as\neither \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is\ncategorized as Core if\nits products and\nservices related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nannual report as\nprincipal components\nof the company's\nstrategy. Products and\nservices are deemed to\nbe principal\ncomponents of a\ncompany's strategy if\nthe company's annual\nreport disclosures\nregarding such\nproducts and services\nare determined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on\nthe frequency and\nposition of such\ndisclosures within an\nannual report. All\nother companies are\ncategorized as Non-\nCore, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain of the\nsegment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index.\nAn Index constituent\ncategorized as Core by\nat least one of the\nUnderlying Indexes\nwill be categorized as\nCore for purposes of\nthe Index. To tilt the\nIndex's exposure\ntoward Core Index\nConstituents, at the\ntime of each rebalance\nthe aggregate\nweighting of Core\nIndex Constituents is\nbased on the\nproportion of the\nnumber of Core Index\nConstituents, plus an\noverweight factor of\nup to 20%. At the time\nof each rebalance,\neach Core Index\nConstituent and Non-\nCore Index Constituent\nis equally weighted\nwithin the group of\nCore Index\nConstituents and Non-\nCore Index\nConstituents,\nrespectively, subject\nto liquidity\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 66\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. 188 Table of\nContents Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Aerospace and\nDefense Companies\nRisk: Aerospace and\ndefense companies can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\naerospace and defense\nregulation and\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely to a\nsignificant extent on\nU.S. (and other)\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Cybersecurity\nCompanies Risk:\nCompanies in the\ncybersecurity field\nface intense\ncompetition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally, which\nmay have an adverse\neffect on profit\nmargins. Cybersecurity\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets, financial\nresources or\npersonnel. The\nproducts of\ncybersecurity\ncompanies may face\nobsolescence due to\nrapid technological\ndevelopments and\nfrequent new product\nintroduction, and such\ncompanies may face\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates,\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel and\ncompetition from\nforeign competitors\nwith lower production\ncosts. Companies in\nthe cybersecurity\nfield are heavily\ndependent on patent\nand intellectual\nproperty rights. The\nloss or impairment of\nthese rights may\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In\ngeneral, cyber-attacks\nare deliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may\nresult in material\nadverse consequences\nfor such company, as\nwell as other\ncompanies included in\nthe Index, and may\ncause the Fund's\ninvestments to lose\nvalue. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. 189 Table of\nContents If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible\ntrade barriers,\ncurrency transfer\nrestrictions, a more\nlimited number of\npotential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\n190 Table of Contents\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nare subject to\npolitical, regulatory,\nand economic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. 191 Table\nof Contents\n\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 26% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho Intelligent\nInfrastructure Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash f lows.\n\n194\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts) of\ncompanies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide which are\nincluded in the\nIntelligent\nInfrastructure sector\nas determined by a\nclassification standard\nproduced by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The\nIndex is designed to\ncapture companies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nbehind intelligent\ninfrastructure. In\nparticular, the Index\ncomprises the\ncomponents of the S&P\nKensho Smart Grids\nIndex and the S&P\nKensho Smart Buildings\nIndex (the \u201cUnderlying\nIndexes\u201d) as of the\nIndex's semi-annual\nselection date, on the\nfirst Friday in June\nand December, subject\nto the following\nliquidity thresholds\nfor each component: (i)\nmust be issued by a\ncompany with a minimum\nfloat market\ncapitalization of at\nleast $100 million and\n(ii) must have a\nminimum three-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of at least $1\nmillion. The S&P Kensho\nSmart Grids Index seeks\nto track companies that\nprovide next generation\nproducts and services\nrelated to power, water\nand transportation\ninfrastructures, or are\na necessary component\nof the supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Smart Buildings\nIndex seeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nthat enable buildings\nto become more\nconnected, intelligent\nand adaptive, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. To determine\nthe constituents of the\nUnderlying Indexes, the\nIndex Provider's\nclassification standard\nutilizes an automated\nscan of companies' most\nrecent annual reports\nfiled with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange\nCommission on Form\n10-K, Form 20-F, Form\n40-F, or S-1 filing and\nprospectus, as\napplicable, to identify\nspecific search terms\nand phrases that\ndescribe a company as\nproducing products and\nservices related to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities for\neach Underlying Index\nis then filtered by\neliminating companies\nthat do not include in\ntheir annual reports a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and (ii)\nis used in a manner\nthat is within the\nscope of the Underlying\nIndex's objective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are not\nlisted on NYSE, NASDAQ,\nIEX, or CBOE exchanges\n(or an affiliate of one\nof those exchanges) or\ndo not meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining eligible\nconstituent to verify\nthe rules of the\nautomated scan were\nimplemented correctly.\nUnderlying Index\nconstituents are then\ncategorized as either\n\u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-Core.\u201d A\ncompany is categorized\nas Core if its products\nand services related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nannual report as\nprincipal components of\nthe company's strategy.\nProducts and services\nare deemed to be\nprincipal components of\na company's strategy if\nthe company's annual\nreport disclosures\nregarding such products\nand services are\ndetermined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on the\nfrequency and position\nof such disclosures\nwithin an annual\nreport. All other\ncompanies are\ncategorized as Non-\nCore, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the supply\nchain of the segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. An\nIndex constituent\ncategorized as Core by\nat least one of the\nUnderlying Indexes will\nbe categorized as Core\nfor purposes of the\nIndex. To tilt the\nIndex's exposure toward\nCore Index\nConstituents, at the\ntime of each rebalance\nthe aggregate weighting\nof Core Index\nConstituents is based\non the proportion of\nthe number of Core\nIndex Constituents,\nplus an overweight\nfactor of up to 20%. At\nthe time of each\nrebalance, each Core\nIndex Constituent and\nNon-Core Index\nConstituent is equally\nweighted within the\ngroup of Core Index\nConstituents and Non-\nCore Index\nConstituents,\nrespectively, subject\nto liquidity\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 45\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. 195 Table\nof Contents Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nInfrastructure-Related\nCompanies Risk:\nInfrastructure-related\ncompanies include\ncompanies that\nprimarily own, manage,\ndevelop and/or operate\ninfrastructure assets,\nincluding\ntransportation,\nutility, energy and/or\ntelecommunications\nassets. Investment in\ninfrastructure-related\nsecurities entails\nexposure to adverse\neconomic, regulatory,\npolitical, legal, and\nother conditions or\nevents affecting the\nissuers of such\nsecurities. Certain\ninfrastructure-related\nentities, particularly\ntelecommunications and\nutilities companies,\nare subject to\nextensive regulation by\nvarious governmental\nauthorities. The costs\nof complying with\ngovernmental\nregulations, delays or\nfailure to receive\nrequired regulatory\napprovals or the\nenactment of new\nadverse regulatory\nrequirements may\nadversely affect\ninfrastructure-related\ncompanies.\nInfrastructure-related\ncompanies may also be\naffected by service\ninterruption and/or\nlegal challenges due to\nenvironmental,\noperational or other\nconditions or events,\nand the imposition of\nspecial tariffs and\nchanges in tax laws,\nregulatory policies and\naccounting standards.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In general,\ncyber-attacks are\ndeliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may result\nin material adverse\nconsequences for such\ncompany, as well as\nother companies\nincluded in the Index,\nand may cause the\nFund's investments to\nlose value. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts may\nbe less liquid and more\nvolatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency than\nits underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts may\nhave limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the issuer\nof the receipts to take\naction. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may\ndiffer from the prices\nof securities upon\nwhich they are based.\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. 196 Table of\nContents Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible trade\nbarriers, currency\ntransfer restrictions,\na more limited number\nof potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid, less\ngovernmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques, differences\nin auditing and\nfinancial reporting\nstandards, and less\ndeveloped legal\nsystems. There is also\nthe potential for\nunfavorable action such\nas expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of securities\nof certain companies in\na particular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in the\ncountry or region. The\nFund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions\nin such securities at\nany time, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in frontier\nmarket countries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund\nis managed with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few 197\nTable of Contents key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-sized\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may be volatile.\nNon-Diversification\nRisk: As a \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d fund, the\nFund may hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nare subject to\npolitical, regulatory,\nand economic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S.\nentity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security and\nthe last quoted price\nfor the underlying\nsecurity on the closed\nforeign market. These\ndeviations could result\nin the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities\ntraded on foreign\nmarkets may be less\nliquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital\nto the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent\nthat the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated\nin a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks\nsuch as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates\nand the risk that a\nforeign government\ncould regulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant impact\non the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts may\nbe less liquid and more\nvolatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant volatility.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any time,\nor at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet\nthe Fund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations. This\nmay occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil\nor reduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value 198 Table of\nContents established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nMark Krivitsky and Kala O'Donnell. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Mark Krivitsky is a Vice President of\nthe Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in\nthe Global Equity Beta Solutions Group and the\nTax-Efficient Market Capture Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 1996. Kala O'Donnell is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n1995. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price 199\n\nTable of Contents greater than NAV (premium)\nor less than NAV (discount). When buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondarymarket,\nyou may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and\ndiscounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 91% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho New Economies\nComposite Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n201\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts) of\ncompanies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide. The Index is\ndesigned to capture\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nand transforming the\nglobal economy through\nthe use of existing and\nemerging technologies,\nand rapid developments\nin robotics,\nautomation, artificial\nintelligence,\nconnectedness and\nprocessing power (\u201cNew\nEconomies companies\u201d).\nIn particular, the\nIndex comprises the\ncomponents included in\nthe New Economy\nSubsector Indexes\n(each, an \u201cUnderlying\nIndex\u201d) developed by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d). Each\nUnderlying Index is\ncomprised of securities\nof New Economies\ncompanies in a specific\nsector. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index was\ncomprised of 22\nUnderlying Indexes. The\nconstituents of each\nUnderlying Index are\ndetermined by a\nclassification standard\nproduced by the Index\nProvider. The\nclassification standard\nutilizes an automated\nscan of companies' most\nrecent annual reports\nfiled with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange\nCommission on Form\n10-K, Form 20-F, Form\n40-F, or S-1 filing and\nprospectus, as\napplicable, to identify\nspecific search terms\nand phrases that\ndescribe a company as\nproducing products and\nservices related to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities for\neach Underlying Index\nis then filtered by\neliminating companies\nthat do not include in\ntheir annual reports a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and (ii)\nis used in a manner\nthat is within the\nscope of the Underlying\nIndex's objective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are not\nlisted on NYSE, NASDAQ,\nIEX, or CBOE exchanges\n(or an affiliate of one\nof those exchanges) or\ndo not meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining eligible\nconstituent to verify\nthe rules of the\nautomated scan were\nimplemented correctly.\nUnderlying Index\nconstituents are then\ncategorized as either\n\u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-Core.\u201d A\ncompany is categorized\nas Core if its products\nand services related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nannual report as\nprincipal components of\nthe company's strategy.\nProducts and services\nare deemed to be\nprincipal components of\na company's strategy if\nthe company's annual\nreport disclosures\nregarding such products\nand services are\ndetermined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on the\nfrequency and position\nof such disclosures\nwithin an annual\nreport. All other\ncompanies are\ncategorized as Non-\nCore, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the supply\nchain of the segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. Each\nUnderlying Index's\nexposure is then tilted\ntowards Core Index\nConstituents. The\nweight of each security\nin the Index is based\non the relative weight\ngiven to each\nUnderlying Index in the\nIndex. The relative\nweight of each\nUnderlying Index is\ndetermined by a\nproprietary process\ncomparing the ratio of\nthe average daily\nreturns divided by the\nstandard deviation of\ndaily returns among the\nUnderlying Indexes.\nUnderlying Indexes with\nlarger ratios are\nweighted more heavily\nthan Underlying Indexes\nwith smaller ratios.\nThe weight of each\nsecurity in each\nUnderlying Index is\nthen multiplied by the\nrelative weight of the\nrespective Underlying\nIndex in the Index to\ndetermine the\nsecurity's final weight\nin the Index. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 396\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. 202\nTable of Contents New\nEconomies Companies\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nare engaged in emerging\nindustries and new\ntechnologies that may\nbe unproven. Such\nindustries and\ntechnologies may be\nadversely affected by\ntechnological advances,\ncompetition, rapid\nproduct or service\nobsolescence, and new\nand evolving\nregulations. Companies\nincluded in the Index\nmay rely on a\ncombination of patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks\nand trade secret laws\nto establish and\nprotect their\nproprietary rights in\ntheir products and\ntechnologies, and may\nbe adversely affected\nby loss or impairment\nof those rights. In\naddition, companies in\nthe Index may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets, financial\nresources or personnel.\nThe Index may include\nstocks of smaller,\nless-seasoned companies\nthat may be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In general,\ncyber-attacks are\ndeliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may result\nin material adverse\nconsequences for such\ncompany, as well as\nother companies\nincluded in the Index,\nand may cause the\nFund's investments to\nlose value. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts may\nbe less liquid and more\nvolatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency than\nits underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts may\nhave limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the issuer\nof the receipts to take\naction. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may\ndiffer from the prices\nof securities upon\nwhich they are based.\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible trade\nbarriers, currency\ntransfer restrictions,\na more limited number\nof potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid, less\ngovernmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques, differences\nin auditing and\nfinancial reporting\nstandards, and less\ndeveloped legal\nsystems. There is also\nthe potential for\nunfavorable action such\nas expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of securities\nof certain companies in\na particular country or\n203 Table of Contents\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in the\ncountry or region. The\nFund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions\nin such securities at\nany time, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in frontier\nmarket countries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nHealth Care Sector\nRisk: Companies in the\nhealth care sector are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernment regulation\nand their profitability\ncan be significantly\naffected by\nrestrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of medical\nproducts and services,\npricing pressure\n(including price\ndiscounting), limited\nproduct lines and an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of\nhealthcare through\noutpatient services.\nCompanies in the health\ncare sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining\nand defending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in technologies\nor other market\ndevelopments. Many new\nproducts in the health\ncare sector require\nsignificant research\nand development and may\nbe subject to\nregulatory approvals,\nall of which may be\ntime consuming and\ncostly with no\nguarantee that any\nproduct will come to\nmarket. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. 204\nTable of Contents Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-sized\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may be volatile.\nNon-Diversification\nRisk: As a \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d fund, the\nFund may hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S.\nentity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security and\nthe last quoted price\nfor the underlying\nsecurity on the closed\nforeign market. These\ndeviations could result\nin the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities\ntraded on foreign\nmarkets may be less\nliquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital\nto the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent\nthat the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated\nin a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks\nsuch as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates\nand the risk that a\nforeign government\ncould regulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant impact\non the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts may\nbe less liquid and more\nvolatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant volatility.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any time,\nor at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet\nthe Fund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations. This\nmay occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil\nor reduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, 205 Table\nof Contents may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.\n\n206\n\nTable of Contents Individual Fund Shares may\nonly be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca,\nInc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondarymarket, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same.

A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 29% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho Smart\nTransportation Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n208\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts) of\ncompanies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide which are\nincluded in the Smart\nTransportation sector\nas determined by a\nclassification standard\nproduced by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d).

In\nparticular, the Index\ncomprises the\ncomponents of the S&P\nKensho Autonomous\nVehicles Index, the S&P\nKensho Advanced\nTransport Systems\nIndex, the S&P Kensho\nElectric Vehicles Index\nand the\ncivilian/commercially\nfocused components of\nthe S&P Kensho Drones\nIndex (the \u201cUnderlying\nIndexes\u201d) as of the\nIndex's semi-annual\nselection date, on the\nfirst Friday in June\nand December, subject\nto the following\nliquidity thresholds\nfor each component: (i)\nmust be issued by a\ncompany with a minimum\nfloat market\ncapitalization of at\nleast $100 million and\n(ii) must have a\nminimum three-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of at least $1\nmillion. The S&P Kensho\nAutonomous Vehicles\nIndex seeks to track\ncompanies that build\nautonomous and\nconnected vehicles and\nthat provide the\nproducts and services\nthat enable these\nvehicles to become more\nefficient and\nintelligent, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Advanced\nTransport Systems Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nthat optimize the\nefficiency of managing\nlarge fleets of\nvehicles, cargo\ntransportation, and\nmass transit, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Electric\nVehicles Index seeks to\ntrack companies that\nproduce products and\nservices related to the\ndevelopment of electric\nvehicles, clean fuel\nsystems, and related\nsystems, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Drones Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nremotely-operated or\nunmanned aerial,\nunderwater and surface-\nlevel drones market and\nrelated subsystems, or\nare a necessary\ncomponent of the supply\nchain for such products\nand services. To\ndetermine the\nconstituents of the\nUnderlying Indexes, the\nIndex Provider's\nclassification standard\nutilizes an automated\nscan of companies' most\nrecent annual reports\nfiled with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange\nCommission on Form\n10-K, Form 20-F, Form\n40-F, or S-1 filing and\nprospectus, as\napplicable, to identify\nspecific search terms\nand phrases that\ndescribe a company as\nproducing products and\nservices related to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities for\neach Underlying Index\nis then filtered by\neliminating companies\nthat do not include in\ntheir annual reports a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and (ii)\nis used in a manner\nthat is within the\nscope of the Underlying\nIndex's objective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are not\nlisted on NYSE, NASDAQ,\nIEX, or CBOE exchanges\n(or an affiliate of one\nof those exchanges) or\ndo not meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining eligible\nconstituent to verify\nthe rules of the\nautomated scan were\nimplemented correctly.\nUnderlying Index\nconstituents are then\ncategorized as either\n\u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-Core.\u201d A\ncompany is categorized\nas Core if its products\nand services related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nannual report as\nprincipal components of\nthe company's strategy.\nProducts and services\nare deemed to be\nprincipal components of\na company's strategy if\nthe company's annual\nreport disclosures\nregarding such products\nand services are\ndetermined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on the\nfrequency and position\nof such disclosures\nwithin an annual\nreport. All other\ncompanies are\ncategorized as Non-\nCore, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the supply\nchain of the segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. An\nIndex constituent\ncategorized as Core by\nat least one of the\nUnderlying Indexes will\nbe categorized as Core\nfor purposes of the\nIndex. To tilt the\nIndex's exposure toward\nCore Index\nConstituents, at the\ntime of each rebalance\nthe aggregate weighting\nof Core Index\nConstituents is based\non the proportion of\nthe number of Core\nIndex Constituents,\nplus an overweight\nfactor of up to 20%. At\nthe time of each\nrebalance, each Core\nIndex Constituent and\nNon-Core Index\nConstituent is equally\nweighted within the\ngroup of Core Index\nConstituents and Non-\nCore Index\nConstituents,\nrespectively, subject\nto liquidity\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 58\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth 209\n\nTable of Contents or\nrecession, changes in\ninterest rates, changes\nin the actual or\nperceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nTransportation\nCompanies Risk:\nTransportation\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices,\nlabor relations,\ntechnology\ndevelopments, exchange\nrates, insurance costs,\nindustry competition\nand government\nregulation.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In general,\ncyber-attacks are\ndeliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may result\nin material adverse\nconsequences for such\ncompany, as well as\nother companies\nincluded in the Index,\nand may cause the\nFund's investments to\nlose value. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily\non disposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. Also,\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on their\nrespective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts may\nbe less liquid and more\nvolatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency than\nits underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts may\nhave limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the issuer\nof the receipts to take\naction. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may\ndiffer from the prices\nof securities upon\nwhich they are based.\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a 210 Table of\nContents derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible trade\nbarriers, currency\ntransfer restrictions,\na more limited number\nof potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid, less\ngovernmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques, differences\nin auditing and\nfinancial reporting\nstandards, and less\ndeveloped legal\nsystems. There is also\nthe potential for\nunfavorable action such\nas expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of securities\nof certain companies in\na particular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in the\ncountry or region. The\nFund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions\nin such securities at\nany time, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in frontier\nmarket countries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund\nis managed with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. 211\nTable of Contents Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-sized\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may be volatile.\nNon-Diversification\nRisk: As a \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d fund, the\nFund may hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S.\nentity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security and\nthe last quoted price\nfor the underlying\nsecurity on the closed\nforeign market. These\ndeviations could result\nin the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities\ntraded on foreign\nmarkets may be less\nliquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital\nto the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent\nthat the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated\nin a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks\nsuch as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates\nand the risk that a\nforeign government\ncould regulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant impact\non the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts may\nbe less liquid and more\nvolatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant volatility.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any time,\nor at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet\nthe Fund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations. This\nmay occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil\nor reduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, 212 Table\nof Contents may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past performance\n(before and after\ntaxes) is not\nnecessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance information\nis available by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/sp\ndrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 16.99% ( Q1,\n2019)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 21.27% ( Q4,\n2018)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 25.40%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.\n\n213\n\nTable of Contents Individual Fund Shares may\nonly be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca,\nInc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondarymarket, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 41% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nMetals & Mining Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. 215\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex represents the\nmetals and mining\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nmetals & mining segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the following\nsub-industries:\nAluminum, Coal &\nConsumable Fuels,\nCopper, Diversified\nMetals & Mining, Gold,\nPrecious Metals &\nMinerals, Silver, and\nSteel. The Index is one\nof twenty-one (21) of\nthe S&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the performance\nof a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of\nsub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Aluminum, Coal &\nConsumable Fuels,\nCopper, Diversified\nMetals & Mining, Gold,\nPrecious Metals &\nMinerals, Silver, and\nSteel sub-industries\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i)\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 22 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Metals\nand Mining Companies\nRisk: Metals and mining\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby events relating to\ninternational political\nand economic\ndevelopments, energy\nconservation, the\nsuccess of exploration\nprojects, commodity\nprices, and tax and\nother government\nregulations.\nInvestments in metals\nand mining companies\nmay be speculative and\nmay be subject to\ngreater price\nvolatility than\ninvestments in other\ntypes of companies.\nRisks of metals and\nmining investments\ninclude: changes in\ninternational monetary\npolicies or economic\nand political\nconditions that can\naffect the supply of\nprecious metals and\nconsequently the value\nof metals and mining\ncompany investments;\nthe United States or\nforeign governments may\npass laws or\nregulations limiting\nmetals investments for\nstrategic or other\npolicy reasons; and\nincreased environmental\nor labor costs may\ndepress the value of\nmetals and mining\ninvestments. 216 Table\nof Contents Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nMaterials Sector Risk:\nMany materials\ncompanies are\nsignificantly affected\nby the level and\nvolatility of commodity\nprices, exchange rates,\nimport controls,\nworldwide competition,\nenvironmental policies\nand consumer demand. At\ntimes, worldwide\nproduction of\nindustrial materials\nhas exceeded demand as\na result of over-\nbuilding or economic\ndownturns, leading to\npoor investment returns\nor losses. Other risks\nmay include liabilities\nfor environmental\ndamage and general\ncivil liabilities,\ndepletion of resources,\nand mandated\nexpenditures for safety\nand pollution control.\nThe materials sector\nmay also be affected by\neconomic cycles,\ntechnical progress,\nlabor relations, and\ngovernment regulations.\nNon-Diversification\nRisk: As a \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d fund, the\nFund may hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\n217 Table of Contents\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                              \n                OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return        14.42%   0.70%      -4.08%    \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      13.64%   0.17%      -4.48%    \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  8.89%    0.40%      -2.99%    \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P Metals &                                \n  Mining                                      \n  Select                                      \n  Industry                                    \n  Index         14.83%   0.68%      -4.07%    \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction     31.49%   11.70%     13.56%    \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Raymond Donofrio. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Raymond\nDonofrio is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Global\nEquity Beta Solutions Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2008. Purchase and Sale Information\nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price\n\n218\n\nTable of Contents greater than NAV (premium)\nor less than NAV (discount). When buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market,\nyou may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and\ndiscounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n219 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment &          \n  Services ETF                                \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment    \n  results                                     \n  that, before fees and expenses, correspond  \n  generally to the total return performance   \n  of an                                       \n  index derived from the oil and gas          \n  equipment and                               \n  services segment of a U.S. total market     \n  composite                                   \n  index.                                      \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 51% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nOil & Gas Equipment &\nServices Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 220\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the oil and\ngas equipment and\nservices segment of the\nS&P Total Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The oil\nand gas equipment and\nservices segment of the\nS&P TMI comprises the\nOil & Gas Drilling sub-\nindustry and the Oil &\nGas Equipment &\nServices sub-industry.\nThe Index is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the performance\nof a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of\nsub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Oil & Gas\nDrilling sub-industry\nand the Oil & Gas\nEquipment & Services\nsub-industry that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 22 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Oil\nand Gas Companies Risk:\nOil and gas companies\ndevelop and produce\ncrude oil and natural\ngas and provide\ndrilling and other\nenergy resources\nproduction and\ndistribution related\nservices. Stock prices\nfor these types of\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor energy products in\ngeneral. The price of\noil and gas,\nexploration and\nproduction spending,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions\nwill likewise affect\nthe performance of\nthese companies.\nCorrespondingly,\nsecurities of companies\nin the energy field are\nsubject to swift price\nand supply fluctuations\ncaused by events\nrelating to\ninternational politics,\nenergy conservation,\nthe success of\nexploration projects,\nand tax and other\ngovernmental regulatory\npolicies. Weak demand\nfor the companies'\nproducts or services or\nfor energy products and\nservices in 221 Table\nof Contents general, as\nwell as negative\ndevelopments in these\nother areas, would\nadversely impact the\nFund's performance. Oil\nand gas equipment and\nservices can be\nsignificantly affected\nby natural disasters as\nwell as changes in\nexchange rates,\ninterest rates,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions.\nThese companies may be\nat risk for\nenvironmental damage\nclaims. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Energy Sector\nRisk: Issuers in\nenergy-related\nindustries can be\nsignificantly affected\nby fluctuations in\nenergy prices and\nsupply and demand of\nenergy fuels. Markets\nfor various energy-\nrelated commodities can\nhave significant\nvolatility, and are\nsubject to control or\nmanipulation by large\nproducers or\npurchasers. Companies\nin the energy sector\nmay need to make\nsubstantial\nexpenditures, and to\nincur significant\namounts of debt, in\norder to maintain or\nexpand their reserves.\nOil and gas exploration\nand production can be\nsignificantly affected\nby natural disasters as\nwell as changes in\nexchange rates,\ninterest rates,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions.\nThese companies may be\nat risk for\nenvironmental damage\nclaims. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations 222\nTable of Contents on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 41% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nOil & Gas Exploration &\nProduction Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 225\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the oil and\ngas exploration and\nproduction segment of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The oil\nand gas exploration and\nproduction segment of\nthe S&P TMI comprises\nthe following sub-\nindustries: Integrated\nOil & Gas, Oil & Gas\nExploration &\nProduction, and Oil &\nGas Refining &\nMarketing. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Integrated Oil &\nGas, Oil & Gas\nExploration &\nProduction, and Oil &\nGas Refining &\nMarketing sub-\nindustries that satisfy\nthe following criteria:\n(i) have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 41 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Oil\nand Gas Companies Risk:\nOil and gas companies\ndevelop and produce\ncrude oil and natural\ngas and provide\ndrilling and other\nenergy resources\nproduction and\ndistribution related\nservices. Stock prices\nfor these types of\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor energy products in\ngeneral. The price of\noil and gas,\nexploration and\nproduction spending,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions\nwill likewise affect\nthe performance of\nthese companies.\nCorrespondingly,\nsecurities of companies\nin the energy field are\nsubject to swift price\nand supply fluctuations\ncaused by events\nrelating to\ninternational politics,\nenergy conservation,\nthe success of\nexploration projects,\nand tax and other\ngovernmental regulatory\npolicies. Weak demand\nfor the companies'\nproducts or services or\nfor energy products and\nservices in 226 Table\nof Contents general, as\nwell as negative\ndevelopments in these\nother areas, would\nadversely impact the\nFund's performance. Oil\nand gas exploration and\nproduction can be\nsignificantly affected\nby natural disasters as\nwell as changes in\nexchange rates,\ninterest rates,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions.\nThese companies may be\nat risk for\nenvironmental damage\nclaims. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Energy Sector\nRisk: Issuers in\nenergy-related\nindustries can be\nsignificantly affected\nby fluctuations in\nenergy prices and\nsupply and demand of\nenergy fuels. Markets\nfor various energy-\nrelated commodities can\nhave significant\nvolatility, and are\nsubject to control or\nmanipulation by large\nproducers or\npurchasers. Companies\nin the energy sector\nmay need to make\nsubstantial\nexpenditures, and to\nincur significant\namounts of debt, in\norder to maintain or\nexpand their reserves.\nOil and gas exploration\nand production can be\nsignificantly affected\nby natural disasters as\nwell as changes in\nexchange rates,\ninterest rates,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions.\nThese companies may be\nat risk for\nenvironmental damage\nclaims. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations 227\nTable of Contents on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 31% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nPharmaceuticals Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 230\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\npharmaceuticals segment\nof the S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\npharmaceuticals segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nPharmaceuticals sub-\nindustry. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Pharmaceuticals\nsub-industry that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 40 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nPharmaceuticals\nCompanies Risk:\nPharmaceutical\ncompanies are heavily\ndependent on patent\nprotection. The\nexpiration of patents\nmay adversely affect\nthe profitability of\nthe companies.\nPharmaceutical\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nother similar claims.\nMany new products are\nsubject to approval of\nthe U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (\u201cFDA\u201d).\nThe process of\nobtaining FDA approval\ncan be long and costly\nand approved products\nare susceptible to\nobsolescence.\nPharmaceutical\ncompanies are also\nsubject to heavy\ncompetitive forces that\nmay make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in\nfact, may result in\nprice discounting. 231\n\nTable of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Health Care\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the health care\nsector are subject to\nextensive government\nregulation and their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of medical\nproducts and services,\npricing pressure\n(including price\ndiscounting), limited\nproduct lines and an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of\nhealthcare through\noutpatient services.\nCompanies in the health\ncare sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining\nand defending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in technologies\nor other market\ndevelopments. Many new\nproducts in the health\ncare sector require\nsignificant research\nand development and may\nbe subject to\nregulatory approvals,\nall of which may be\ntime consuming and\ncostly with no\nguarantee that any\nproduct will come to\nmarket. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations 232\nTable of Contents on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondarymarket, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 35%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nRegional Banks Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n235\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\nregional banks segment\nof the S&P Total\nMarket Index (\u201cS&P\nTMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the\nbroad U.S. equity\nmarket. The regional\nbanks segment of the\nS&P TMI comprises the\nRegional Banks sub-\nindustry. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nRegional Banks sub-\nindustry that satisfy\nthe following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced\nto the available\ntrading period for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions.\nRebalancing occurs on\nthe third Friday of\nthe quarter ending\nmonth. The S&P TMI\ntracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX exchanges.\nThe Index is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, the\nIndex comprised 130\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Banking\nCompanies Risk: The\nperformance of bank\nstocks may be affected\nby extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, and the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds,\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers can\nnegatively impact\nbanking companies.\nBanks may also be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nCompetition is high\namong banking\ncompanies and failure\nto maintain or\nincrease market share\nmay result in lost\nmarket value. 236\nTable of Contents\n\nFinancial Institutions\nRisk: Changes in the\ncreditworthiness of\nfinancial institutions\n(such as banks and\nbroker-dealers) may\nadversely affect the\nvalues of instruments\nof issuers in\nfinancial industries.\nAdverse developments\nin banking and other\nfinancial industries\nmay cause the Fund to\nunderperform relative\nto other funds that\ninvest more broadly\nacross different\nindustries or have a\nsmaller exposure to\nfinancial\ninstitutions. Changes\nin governmental\nregulation and\noversight of financial\ninstitutions may have\nan adverse effect on\nthe financial\ncondition of a\nfinancial institution.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more 237\nTable of Contents\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective October 24, 2011 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the KBW Regional\nBanking Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d)\nto the S&P Regional Banks Select Industry\nIndex, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 43% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nRetail Select Industry\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 240 Table of\nContents\n\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the retail\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nretail segment of the\nS&P TMI comprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries: Apparel\nRetail, Automotive\nRetail, Computer &\nElectronic Retail,\nDepartment Stores, Drug\nRetail, Food Retailers,\nGeneral Merchandise\nStores, Hypermarkets &\nSuper Centers, Internet\n& Direct Marketing\nRetail, and Specialty\nStores. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Apparel Retail,\nAutomotive Retail,\nComputer & Electronic\nRetail, Department\nStores, Drug Retail,\nFood Retailers, General\nMerchandise Stores,\nHypermarkets & Super\nCenters, Internet &\nDirect Marketing\nRetail, and Specialty\nStores sub-industries\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i)\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market,\nInvestors Exchange\n(IEX), NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 82 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Retail\nCompanies Risk: Retail\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby the performance of\nthe domestic and\ninternational economy,\nconsumer confidence and\nspending, intense\ncompetition, changes in\ndemographics, and\nchanging consumer\ntastes and preferences.\n241 Table of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily\non disposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. Also,\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on their\nrespective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace. Consumer\nStaples Sector Risk:\nConsumer staples\ncompanies are subject\nto government\nregulation affecting\ntheir products which\nmay negatively impact\nsuch companies'\nperformance. For\ninstance, government\nregulations may affect\nthe permissibility of\nusing various food\nadditives and\nproduction methods of\ncompanies that make\nfood products, which\ncould affect company\nprofitability. Tobacco\ncompanies may be\nadversely affected by\nthe adoption of\nproposed legislation\nand/or by litigation.\nAlso, the success of\nfood, beverage,\nhousehold and personal\nproduct companies may\nbe strongly affected by\nconsumer interest,\nmarketing campaigns and\nother factors affecting\nsupply and demand,\nincluding performance\nof the overall domestic\nand global economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence and\nspending. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty ,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral posted\nby its counterparty ,\nit may be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty .\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 242\n\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Ted Janowsky. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997.\n\n243\n\nTable of Contents Ted Janowsky, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondarymarket, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 21% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSemiconductor Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 245 Table of\nContents\n\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\nsemiconductors segment\nof the S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nsemiconductors segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nSemiconductors sub-\nindustry. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Semiconductors\nsub-industry that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. If\nthere are fewer than 35\nstocks, stocks from the\nSemiconductor Equipment\nsub-industry that meet\nthe market\ncapitalization and\nliquidity thresholds\nare included in order\nof their float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions.

Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nSemiconductor Companies\nRisk: The Fund is\nsubject to the risk\nthat market or economic\nfactors impacting\nsemiconductor companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\nsemiconductor companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in product\ncycles, rapid product\nobsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nSemiconductor companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology,\n246 Table of Contents\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nAdditionally,\nsemiconductor companies\nmay face dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates\nand competition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty ,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral posted\nby its counterparty ,\nit may be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty .\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). 247 Table\nof Contents Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondarymarket, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 31% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSoftware & Services\nSelect Industry Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 250\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the software\nand services segment of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nsoftware and services\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the following\nsub-industries:\nApplication Software,\nData Processing &\nOutsourced Services,\nInteractive Home\nEntertainment, IT\nConsulting & Other\nServices, and Systems\nSoftware. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Application\nSoftware, Data\nProcessing & Outsourced\nServices, Interactive\nHome Entertainment, IT\nConsulting & Other\nServices, and Systems\nSoftware sub-industries\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i)\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. Rebalancing\noccurs on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month.

The\nIndex is modified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2020, the Index\ncomprised 167 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nComputer\nSoftware/Services\nCompanies Risk:\nComputer\nsoftware/services\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby competitive\npressures, aggressive\npricing, technological\ndevelopments, changing\ndomestic demand, the\nability to attract and\nretain skilled\nemployees and\navailability and price\nof components. The\nmarket for products\nproduced by computer\nsoftware/services\ncompanies is\ncharacterized by\nrapidly changing\ntechnology, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ncyclical market\npatterns, evolving\nindustry standards and\nfrequent new product\nintroductions. The\nsuccess of computer\nsoftware/services\ncompanies depends in\nsubstantial part on the\ntimely and successful\nintroduction of new\nproducts and the\nability to service such\nproducts. An unexpected\nchange in one or more\nof the 251 Table of\nContents technologies\naffecting an issuer's\nproducts or in the\nmarket for products\nbased on a particular\ntechnology could have a\nmaterial adverse effect\non a participant's\noperating results. Many\ncomputer\nsoftware/services\ncompanies rely on a\ncombination of patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks\nand trade secret laws\nto establish and\nprotect their\nproprietary rights in\ntheir products and\ntechnologies. There can\nbe no assurance that\nthe steps taken by\ncomputer\nsoftware/services\ncompanies to protect\ntheir proprietary\nrights will be adequate\nto prevent\nmisappropriation of\ntheir technology or\nthat competitors will\nnot independently\ndevelop technologies\nthat are substantially\nequivalent or superior\nto such companies'\ntechnology. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatilityor periods of\nsteep market declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business, and\nother developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty ,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral posted\nby its counterparty ,\nit may be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty .\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the\nFund'sreturn may not\nmatch the return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. 252\nTable of Contents Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market,you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 44% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nTelecom Select Industry\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 255 Table of\nContents\n\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\ntelecommunications\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\ntelecommunications\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the following\nsub-industries:\nAlternative Carriers,\nCommunications\nEquipment, Integrated\nTelecommunication\nServices, and Wireless\nTelecommunication\nServices. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Alternative\nCarriers,\nCommunications\nEquipment, Integrated\nTelecommunication\nServices, and Wireless\nTelecommunication\nServices sub-industries\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i)\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions.

Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nTelecommunications\nSector Risk: The\ntelecommunications\nindustry is subject to\nextensive government\nregulation. The costs\nof complying with\ngovernmental\nregulations, delays or\nfailure to receive\nrequired regulatory\napprovals or the\nenactment of new\nadverse regulatory\nrequirements may\nadversely affect the\nbusiness of the\ntelecommunications\ncompanies. The\ntelecommunications\nindustry can also be\nsignificantly affected\nby intense 256 Table of\nContents competition,\nincluding competition\nwith alternative\ntechnologies such as\nwireless\ncommunications, product\ncompatibility, consumer\npreferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence\nand research and\ndevelopment of new\nproducts. Technological\ninnovations may make\nthe products and\nservices of\ntelecommunications\ncompanies obsolete.\nOther risks include\nuncertainties resulting\nfrom such companies'\ndiversification into\nnew domestic and\ninternational\nbusinesses, as well as\nagreements by any such\ncompanies linking\nfuture rate increases\nto inflation or other\nfactors not directly\nrelated to the actual\noperating profits of\nthe enterprise.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty ,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral posted\nby its counterparty ,\nit may be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty .\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more 257\nTable of Contents\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Michael Finocchi. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Michael\nFinocchi is a Principal of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary 258\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 29% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nTransportation Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 260 Table of\nContents\n\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\ntransportation segment\nof the S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\ntransportation segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the following\nsub-industries: Air\nFreight & Logistics,\nAirlines, Airport\nServices, Highways &\nRail Tracks, Marine,\nMarine Ports &\nServices, Railroads,\nand Trucking. The Index\nis one of twenty-one\n(21) of the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Air Freight &\nLogistics, Airlines,\nAirport Services,\nHighways & Rail Tracks,\nMarine, Marine Ports &\nServices, Railroads,\nand Trucking sub-\nindustries that satisfy\nthe following criteria:\n(i) have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. The length\nof time to evaluate\nliquidity is reduced to\nthe available trading\nperiod for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history. The\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions.

Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nTransportation\nCompanies Risk:\nTransportation\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices,\nlabor relations,\ntechnology\ndevelopments, exchange\nrates, insurance costs,\nindustry competition\nand government\nregulation. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\n261 Table of Contents\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty ,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral posted\nby its counterparty ,\nit may be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty .\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. 262\nTable of Contents Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.\n\n263 Table of Contents Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondarymarket, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 36% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of Wells\nFargo Hybrid and\nPreferred Securities\nAggregate Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d)\neither may invest the\nFund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the 265\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis a modified market\ncapitalization weighted\nindex designed to\nmeasure the performance\nof non-convertible\npreferred stock and\nsecurities that are\nfunctionally equivalent\nto preferred stock,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, depositary\npreferred securities,\nperpetual subordinated\ndebt and certain\nsecurities issued by\nbanks and other\nfinancial institutions\nthat are eligible for\ncapital treatment with\nrespect to such\ninstruments akin to\nthat received for\nissuance of straight\npreferred stock\n(collectively,\n\u201cPreferred\nSecurities\u201d). Preferred\nSecurities generally\npay fixed rate\ndistributions and\ntypically have\n\u201cpreference\u201d over\ncommon stock in the\npayment of\ndistributions and the\nliquidation of a\ncompany's assets \u2014\npreference means that a\ncompany must pay\ndistributions on its\nPreferred Securities\nbefore paying dividends\non its common stock,\nand the claims of\nPreferred Securities\nholders are ahead of\ncommon stockholders'\nclaims on assets in a\ncorporate liquidation.\nThe Index includes\nPreferred Securities\nthat meet the following\ncriteria: (i) are non-\nconvertible; (ii) have\na par amount of $25;\n(iii) are listed on the\nNew York Stock Exchange\nor NYSE Arca, Inc.\n(\u201cNYSE Arca\u201d); (iv)\nmaintain a minimum par\nvalue of $250 million;\n(v) are U.S. dollar\ndenominated; (vi) are\nrated investment grade\nby one of Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc.\nor Standard & Poor's\nFinancial Services, LLC\nratings services; (vii)\nare publicly registered\nor exempt from\nregistration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933;\nand (viii) have a\nminimum monthly trading\nvolume during each of\nthe last six months of\nat least 250,000\ntrading units. The\nIndex does not include\nauction rate preferred\nsecurities, convertible\npreferred shares,\nsecurities subject to\nsinking fund\nprovisions, shares in\nclosed-end funds,\nmunicipal securities,\nor repackaged\nsecurities linked to a\nsecurity, a basket of\nsecurities or an index.\nThe Index is rebalanced\nmonthly, on the final\nNYSE Arca trading day\nof each month. Issuers\nof Preferred Securities\nmay be either U.S.\nbased or foreign. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial and utilities\nsectors, although this\nmay change from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 163 Preferred\nSecurities. The Index\nis sponsored by Wells\nFargo & Company (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nPreferred Securities\nRisk: Generally,\nPreferred Security\nholders have no or\nlimited voting rights\nwith respect to the\nissuing company. In\naddition, Preferred\nSecurities are\nsubordinated to bonds\nand other debt\ninstruments in a\ncompany's capital\nstructure and therefore\nwill be subject to\ngreater credit risk\nthan those debt\ninstruments. Dividend\npayments on a Preferred\nSecurity typically must\nbe declared by the\nissuer's board of\ndirectors. In the event\nan issuer of Preferred\nSecurities experiences\neconomic difficulties,\nthe issuer's Preferred\nSecurities may lose\nsubstantial value due\nto the reduced\nlikelihood that the\nissuer's board of\ndirectors will declare\na dividend and the fact\nthat the Preferred\nSecurity may be\nsubordinated to other\nsecurities of the same\nissuer. Further,\nbecause many Preferred\nSecurities pay\ndividends at a fixed\nrate, their market\nprice can be sensitive\nto changes in interest\nrates in a manner\nsimilar to bonds \u2014 that\nis, as interest rates\nrise, the value of the\nPreferred Securities\nheld by the Fund are\nlikely to decline. In\naddition, because many\nPreferred Securities\nallow holders to\nconvert the Preferred\nSecurities into common\nstock of the issuer,\ntheir market price can\nbe sensitive to changes\nin the value of the\nissuer's common stock\nand, therefore,\ndeclining common stock\nvalues may also cause\nthe value of the Fund's\n266 Table of Contents\ninvestments to decline.\nPreferred securities\noften have call\nfeatures which allow\nthe issuer to redeem\nthe security at its\ndiscretion. The\nredemption of a\nPreferred Security\nhaving a higher than\naverage yield may cause\na decrease in the\nFund's yield.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty ,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral posted\nby its counterparty ,\nit may be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty .\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts may\nbe less liquid and more\nvolatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency than\nits underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts may\nhave limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the issuer\nof the receipts to take\naction. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may\ndiffer from the prices\nof securities upon\nwhich they are based.\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may 267 Table of\nContents be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e.,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S.\nentity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security and\nthe last quoted price\nfor the underlying\nsecurity on the closed\nforeign market. These\ndeviations could result\nin the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities\ntraded on foreign\nmarkets may be less\nliquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital\nto the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent\nthat the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated\nin a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks\nsuch as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates\nand the risk that a\nforeign government\ncould regulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant impact\non the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts may\nbe less liquid and more\nvolatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Unconstrained\nSector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a\nsubstantial portion of\nits assets within one\nor more economic\nsectors or industries,\nwhich may change from\ntime to time. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\nUtilities Sector Risk:\nUtility companies are\naffected by supply and\ndemand, operating\ncosts, government\nregulation,\nenvironmental factors,\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities, and rate\ncaps or rate changes.\nAlthough rate changes\nof a utility usually\nfluctuate in\napproximate correlation\nwith financing costs,\ndue to political and\nregulatory factors rate\nchanges ordinarily\noccur only following a\ndelay after the changes\nin financing costs.\nThis factor will tend\nto favorably affect a\nregulated utility\ncompany's earnings and\ndividends in times of\ndecreasing costs, but\nconversely, will tend\nto adversely affect\nearnings and dividends\nwhen costs are rising.\nThe value of regulated\nutility debt securities\n(and, to a lesser\nextent, equity\nsecurities) may tend to\nhave an inverse\nrelationship to the\nmovement of interest\nrates. Certain utility\ncompanies have\nexperienced full or\npartial deregulation in\nrecent years. These\nutility companies are\nfrequently more similar\nto industrial companies\nin that they are\nsubject to greater\ncompetition and have\nbeen permitted by\nregulators to diversify\noutside of their\noriginal geographic\nregions and their\ntraditional lines of\nbusiness. These\nopportunities may\npermit certain utility\ncompanies to earn more\nthan their traditional\nregulated rates of\nreturn. Some companies,\nhowever, may be forced\nto defend 268 Table of\nContents their core\nbusiness and may be\nless profitable. In\naddition, natural\ndisasters, terrorist\nattacks, government\nintervention or other\nfactors may render a\nutility company's\nequipment unusable or\nobsolete and negatively\nimpact profitability.\nAmong the risks that\nmay affect utility\ncompanies are the\nfollowing: risks of\nincreases in fuel and\nother operating costs;\nthe high cost of\nborrowing to finance\ncapital construction\nduring inflationary\nperiods; restrictions\non operations and\nincreased costs and\ndelays associated with\ncompliance with\nenvironmental and\nnuclear safety\nregulations; and the\ndifficulties involved\nin obtaining natural\ngas for resale or fuel\nfor generating\nelectricity at\nreasonable prices.\nOther risks include\nthose related to the\nconstruction and\noperation of nuclear\npower plants, the\neffects of energy\nconservation and the\neffects of regulatory\nchanges.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Amy Scofield. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Amy Scofield is\na Principal of the Adviser and a Portfolio\nManager in the Global Equity Beta Solutions\nGroup. She joined the Adviser in 2010.\n\n269\n\nTable of Contents Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n270 Table of Contents Additional Strategies\nInformation Principal Strategies General .\nPlease see each Fund's \u201cThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund\nSummaries\u201d above for a complete discussion of\neach Fund's principal investment strategies. A\nFund may invest in various types of securities\nand engage in various investment techniques\nwhich are not the principal focus of the Fund\nand therefore are not described in this\nProspectus. These securities, techniques and\npractices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain\nfree of charge by contacting shareholder\nservices (see the back cover of this\nProspectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of\neach Fund's Index as closely as possible\n(i.e., obtain a high degree of correlation\nwith the Index). A number of factors may\naffect a Fund's ability to achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with its Index, and\nthere can be no guarantee that a Fund will\nachieve a high degree of correlation. For\nexample, a Fund may not be able to achieve a\nhigh degree of correlation with its Index when\nthere are practical difficulties or\nsubstantial costs involved in compiling a\nportfolio of securities to follow the Index,\nwhen a security in the Index becomes\ntemporarily illiquid, unavailable or less\nliquid, or legal restrictions exist that\nprohibit the Fund from investing in a security\nin the Index. The Adviser will utilize a\nsampling strategy in managing the Funds.\nSampling means that the Adviser uses\nquantitative analysis to select securities,\nincluding securities in the Index, outside of\nthe Index and derivatives that have a similar\ninvestment profile as the relevant Index in\nterms of key risk factors, performance\nattributes and other economic characteristics.\nThese include industry weightings, market\ncapitalization, and other financial\ncharacteristics of securities. The quantity of\nholdings in a Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nIn addition, from time to time, securities are\nadded to or removed from each Index. The\nAdviser may sell securities that are\nrepresented in an Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in an\nIndex, in anticipation of their removal from\nor addition to an Index. Further, the Adviser\nmay choose to overweight securities in an\nIndex, purchase or sell securities not in an\nIndex, or utilize various combinations of\nother available techniques, in seeking to\ntrack an Index. Certain of the Funds, as\ndescribed in the SAI, have adopted a non-\nfundamental investment policy to invest at\nleast 80% of their respective net assets, plus\nthe amount of borrowings for investment\npurposes, in investments suggested by their\nrespective names, measured at the time of\ninvestment. A Fund will provide shareholders\nwith at least 60 days' notice prior to any\nchange in this non-fundamental 80% investment\npolicy. The Board of Trustees of the Trust\n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change a Fund's investment\nstrategy, Index and other policies without\nshareholder approval, except as otherwise\nindicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI.\nThe Board may also change a Fund's investment\nobjective without shareholder approval. Non-\nPrincipal Strategies Certain Other Investments\n. Each Fund may invest in structured notes\n(notes on which the amount of principal\nrepayment and interest payments are based on\nthe movement of one or more specified factors\nsuch as the movement of a particular security\nor index), swaps, options and futures\ncontracts. Swaps, options and futures\ncontracts and structured notes may be used by\na Fund in seeking performance that corresponds\nto its Index and in managing cash flows.\nTemporary Defensive Positions . In certain\nsituations or market conditions, a Fund may\ntemporarily depart from its normal investment\npolicies and strategies, provided that the\nalternative is consistent with the Fund's\ninvestment objective and is in the best\ninterest of the Fund. For example, a Fund may\nmake larger than normal investments in\nderivatives to maintain exposure to its Index\nif it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . Each\nFund may borrow money from a bank as permitted\nby the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing\nstatute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund, but only for\ntemporary or emergency purposes. Each Fund may\nalso invest in reverse repurchase agreements,\nwhich are considered borrowings under the 1940\nAct. Although the 1940 Act presently allows a\nFund to borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or 271 Table of Contents\n\nhypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/\n3% of its total assets (not including\ntemporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of\nits total assets), and there is no percentage\nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nunder normal circumstances any borrowings by a\nFund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's total\nassets. Lending of Securities . Each Fund may\nlend its portfolio securities in an amount not\nto exceed 40% of the value of its net assets\nvia a securities lending program through its\nsecurities lending agent, State Street Bank\nand Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d or the\n\u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers, dealers and\nother financial institutions desiring to\nborrow securities to complete transactions and\nfor other purposes.

In the securities lending\nprogram, the borrower generally has the right\nto vote the loaned securities; however, a Fund\nmay call loans to vote proxies if a material\nissue affecting the Fund's economic interest\nin the investment is to be voted upon.\nSecurity loans may be terminated at any time\nby a Fund.\nAdditional Risk Information The following     \nsection provides information regarding the    \nprincipal risks identified under \u201cPrincipal   \nRisks of Investing in the Fund\u201d in each Fund  \nSummary along with additional risk            \ninformation.

       \n293\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAerospace and Defense Companies Risk .\nAerospace and defense companies can be\nsignificantly affected by government aerospace\nand defense regulation and spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry\nrely to a significant extent on U.S. (and\nother) government demand for their products\nand services. Thus, the financial condition\nof, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which\nare typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol the U.S. (and other) government\nbudgets. Banking Companies Risk . The\nperformance of bank stocks may be affected by\nextensive governmental regulation which may\nlimit both the amounts and types of loans and\nother financial commitments they can make, and\nthe interest rates and fees they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain.\nProfitability is largely dependent on the\navailability and cost of capital funds, and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change. Credit losses resulting from\nfinancial difficulties of borrowers can\nnegatively impact the banking companies. Banks\nmay also be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Competition among banking\ncompanies is high and failure to maintain or\nincrease market share may result in lost\nmarket value. Biotechnology Companies Risk .\nBiotech companies invest heavily in research\nand development which may not necessarily lead\nto commercially successful products. These\ncompanies are also subject to increased\ngovernmental regulation which may delay or\ninhibit the release of new products. Many\nbiotech companies are dependent upon their\nability to use and enforce intellectual\nproperty rights and patents. Any impairment of\nsuch rights may have adverse financial\nconsequences. Biotech stocks, especially those\nof smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to\nbe more volatile than the overall market.\nBiotech companies can be significantly\naffected by technological change and\nobsolescence, product liability lawsuits and\nconsequential high insurance costs. Capital\nMarkets Companies Risk . Companies within an\nIndex can be significantly affected by stock\nand bank trading activity, changes in\ngovernmental regulation, continuing increases\nin price competition, decreases in fees or\nfee-related business, including investment\nbanking, brokerage, asset management and other\nservicing fees, fluctuation in interest rates\nand other factors which could adversely affect\nfinancial markets. Clean Power Companies Risk.\nClean power companies may be highly dependent\nupon government subsidies, contracts with\ngovernment entities, and the successful\ndevelopment of new and proprietary\ntechnologies. Clean power companies may be\naffected by competition from new and existing\nmarket entrants, obsolescence of technology,\nshort product cycles, changes in exchange\nrates, imposition of import controls, and\ndepletion of resources. In addition, seasonal\nweather conditions, fluctuations in supply of\nand demand for clean energy products or\nservices, and international political events\nmay cause fluctuations in the performance of\nclean power companies and the prices of their\nsecurities. Risks associated with fluctuations\nin energy prices and supply and demand of\nalternative energy fuels, energy conservation,\nthe success of exploration projects and tax\nand other government regulations can\nsignificantly affect clean power companies.\nThe supply and demand for oil and gas, the\nprice of oil and gas, production spending,\ngovernment regulation, world events and\neconomic conditions may also affect clean\npower companies. Communication Services Sector\nRisk. Communication services companies are\nparticularly vulnerable to the potential\nobsolescence of products and services due to\ntechnological advancement and the innovation\nof competitors. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may also be affected by other\ncompetitive pressures, such as pricing\ncompetition, as well as research and\ndevelopment costs, substantial capital\nrequirements and government regulation.\nAdditionally, fluctuating domestic and\ninternational demand, shifting demographics\nand often unpredictable changes in consumer\ntastes can drastically affect a communication\nservices company's profitability. While all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nComputer Software/Services Companies Risk .\nComputer software/services companies can be\nsignificantly affected by competitive\npressures, aggressive pricing, technological\ndevelopments, changing domestic demand, the\nability to attract and retain skilled\nemployees and availability and price of\ncomponents. The market for products produced\nby computer software/services companies is\ncharacterized by rapidly changing technology,\nrapid product obsolescence, cyclical market\npatterns, evolving industry standards and\nfrequent new product introductions. The\nsuccess of computer\n\n294\n\nTable of Contents software/services companies\ndepends in substantial part on the timely and\nsuccessful introduction of new products and\nthe ability to service such products. An\nunexpected change in one or more of the\ntechnologies affecting an issuer's products or\nin the market for products based on a\nparticular technology could have a material\nadverse effect on a participant's operating\nresults. Many computer software/services\ncompanies rely on a combination of patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws\nto establish and protect their proprietary\nrights in their products and technologies.\nThere can be no assurance that the steps taken\nby computer software/services companies to\nprotect their proprietary rights will be\nadequate to prevent misappropriation of their\ntechnology or that competitors will not\nindependently develop technologies that are\nsubstantially equivalent or superior to such\ncompanies' technology. Concentration Risk . A\nFund's assets will generally be concentrated\nin an industry or group of industries to the\nextent that the Fund's underlying Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group\nof industries. When a Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or\nsector, financial, economic, business, and\nother developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have\na greater effect on the Fund than if it had\nnot focused its assets in that industry,\nmarket, or economic sector, which may increase\nthe volatility of the Fund. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector Risk . The success of\nconsumer product manufacturers and retailers\nis tied closely to the performance of the\noverall global economy, interest rates,\ncompetition and consumer confidence. Success\ndepends heavily on disposable household income\nand consumer spending. Also, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary sector may be subject\nto severe competition, which may have an\nadverse impact on their respective\nprofitability. Changes in demographics and\nconsumer tastes can also affect the demand\nfor, and success of, consumer products and\nservices in the marketplace. Consumer Staples\nSector Risk . Consumer staples companies are\nsubject to government regulation affecting\ntheir products which may negatively impact\nsuch companies' performance. For instance,\ngovernment regulations may affect the\npermissibility of using various food additives\nand production methods of companies that make\nfood products, which could affect company\nprofitability. Tobacco companies may be\nadversely affected by the adoption of proposed\nlegislation and/or by litigation. Also, the\nsuccess of food, beverage, household and\npersonal products companies may be strongly\naffected by consumer interest, marketing\ncampaigns and other factors affecting supply\nand demand, including performance of the\noverall domestic and international economy,\ninterest rates, competition and consumer\nconfidence and spending. Counterparty Risk . A\nFund will be subject to credit risk with\nrespect to the counterparties with which the\nFund enters into derivatives contracts and\nother transactions such as repurchase\nagreements or reverse repurchase agreements. A\nFund's ability to profit from these types of\ninvestments and transactions will depend on\nthe willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate\nor realize any gain on the investment or\ntransaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund.\nA Fund may experience significant delays in\nobtaining any recovery in an insolvency,\nbankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding\ninvolving its counterparty (including recovery\nof any collateral posted by it) and may obtain\nonly a limited recovery or may obtain no\nrecovery in such circumstances. If a Fund\nholds collateral posted by its counterparty,\nit may be delayed or prevented from realizing\non the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if a Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another institution being\nsubstituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, a\nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the\nfinancial institution's authority, the\nfinancial institution's liabilities could be\nwritten down, eliminated or converted into\nequity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial\ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of its securities and, if a\nFund holds such securities or has entered into\na transaction with such a financial security\nwhen a bail-in occurs, such Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Currency Risk. Investments\nin issuers in different countries are often\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar. Changes in the values of those\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar may\nhave a positive or negative effect on the\nvalues of a Fund's investments denominated in\nthose currencies. The values of other\ncurrencies relative to the\n\n295 Table of Contents U.S. dollar may\nfluctuate in response to, among other factors,\ninterest rate changes, intervention (or\nfailure to intervene) by national governments,\ncentral banks, or supranational entities such\nas the International Monetary Fund, the\nimposition of currency controls, and other\npolitical or regulatory developments. Currency\nvalues can decrease significantly both in the\nshort term and over the long term in response\nto these and other developments. Continuing\nuncertainty as to the status of the Euro and\nthe Economic and Monetary Union of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201cEMU\u201d) has created\nsignificant volatility in currency and\nfinancial markets generally. Any partial or\ncomplete dissolution of the EMU, or any\ncontinued uncertainty as to its status, could\nhave significant adverse effects on currency\nand financial markets, and on the values of a\nFund's portfolio investments. Cybersecurity\nCompanies Risk . Companies in the\ncybersecurity field face intense competition,\nboth domestically and internationally, which\nmay have an adverse effect on profit margins.\nCybersecurity companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. The products of cybersecurity\ncompanies may face obsolescence due to rapid\ntechnological developments and frequent new\nproduct introduction, and such companies may\nface unpredictable changes in growth rates,\ncompetition for the services of qualified\npersonnel and competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs.\nCompanies in the cybersecurity field are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual\nproperty rights. The loss or impairment of\nthese rights may adversely affect the\nprofitability of these companies.\nCybersecurity-Related Risk . The companies\nincluded in the Index rely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet and depend on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, and therefore may be prone to\noperational and information security risks\nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or\ntechnological malfunctions. Cyber-attacks\ninclude, among others, stealing or corrupting\ndata maintained online or digitally,\npreventing legitimate users from accessing\ninformation or services on a website,\nreleasing confidential information without\nauthorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. In general, cyber-attacks are\ndeliberate, but unintentional events may have\nsimilar effects. Successful cyber-attacks\nagainst, or security breakdowns of, a company\nincluded in the Index may result in material\nadverse consequences for such company, as well\nas other companies included in the Index, and\nmay cause a Fund's investments to lose value.\nDepositary Receipts Risk . American Depositary\nReceipts (\u201cADRs\u201d) are typically trust receipts\nissued by a U.S. bank or trust company that\nevidence an indirect interest in underlying\nsecurities issued by a foreign entity. Global\nDepositary Receipts (\u201cGDRs\u201d), European\nDepositary Receipts (\u201cEDRs\u201d), and other types\nof depositary receipts are typically issued by\nnon-U.S. banks or financial institutions to\nevidence an interest in underlying securities\nissued by either a U.S. or a non-U.S. entity.\nInvestments in non-U.S. issuers through ADRs,\nGDRs, EDRs, and other types of depositary\nreceipts generally involve risks applicable to\nother types of investments in non-U.S.\nissuers. Investments in depositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and more volatile than the\nunderlying securities in their primary trading\nmarket. If a depositary receipt is denominated\nin a different currency than its underlying\nsecurities, a Fund will be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both the investment in the\ndepositary receipt and the underlying\nsecurity. There may be less publicly available\ninformation regarding the issuer of the\nsecurities underlying a depositary receipt\nthan if those securities were traded directly\nin U.S. securities markets. Depositary\nreceipts may or may not be sponsored by the\nissuers of the underlying securities, and\ninformation regarding issuers of securities\nunderlying unsponsored depositary receipts may\nbe more limited than for sponsored depositary\nreceipts. The values of depositary receipts\nmay decline for a number of reasons relating\nto the issuers or sponsors of the depositary\nreceipts, including, but not limited to,\ninsolvency of the issuer or sponsor. Holders\nof depositary receipts may have limited or no\nrights to take action with respect to the\nunderlying securities or to compel the issuer\nof the receipts to take action. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may differ from the prices\nof securities upon which they are based. To\nthe extent a Fund invests in depositary\nreceipts based on securities included in its\nIndex, such differences in prices may increase\nindex tracking risk. Derivatives Risk. A\nderivative is a financial contract the value\nof which depends on, or is derived from, the\nvalue of an underlying asset, interest rate,\nor index. Derivative transactions typically\ninvolve leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a derivative\ntransaction will result in a loss greater than\nthe principal amount invested, and a Fund may\nnot be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price.\nRisks associated with derivative instruments\ninclude potential changes in value in response\nto interest rate changes or other market\ndevelopments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential\nfor the derivative transaction not to have the\neffect the Adviser anticipated or a different\nor less favorable effect than the Adviser\nanticipated; the failure of the counterparty\nto the derivative transaction to perform its\nobligations under the transaction or to settle\na trade; possible mispricing or improper\nvaluation of the derivative instrument;\nimperfect correlation in the value of a\nderivative with the asset, rate, or 296 Table\nof Contents index underlying the derivative;\nthe risk that a Fund may be required to post\ncollateral or margin with its counterparty,\nand will not be able to recover the collateral\nor margin in the event of the counterparty's\ninsolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that a Fund\nwill experience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including without\nlimitation absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to a\nFund due to losses on the transaction and an\nincrease in volatility; the potential for the\nderivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction.\nFutures Contract Risk; Other Exchange-Traded\nDerivatives Risk . The risk of loss relating\nto the use of futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives is potentially\nunlimited. The ability to establish and close\nout positions in futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives will be subject to\nthe development and maintenance of a liquid\nsecondary market. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract or\nother exchange-traded derivative or at any\nparticular time. In the event no such market\nexists for a particular derivative, it might\nnot be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate the derivative. In using futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives, the Fund will be reliant on the\nability of the Adviser to predict market and\nprice movements correctly; the skills needed\nto use such derivatives successfully are\ndifferent from those needed for traditional\nportfolio management. If the Fund uses futures\ncontracts or other exchange-traded derivatives\nfor hedging purposes, there is a risk of\nimperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the derivatives and movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying the derivatives\nor movements in the prices of the Fund's\ninvestments that are the subject of such\nhedge. The prices of futures and other\nexchange-traded derivatives, for a number of\nreasons, may not correlate perfectly with\nmovements in the securities or index\nunderlying them. For example, participants in\nthe futures markets and in markets for other\nexchange-traded derivatives are subject to\nmargin deposit requirements. Such requirements\nmay cause investors to take actions with\nrespect to their derivatives positions that\nthey would not otherwise take. The margin\nrequirements in the derivatives markets may be\nless onerous than margin requirements in the\nsecurities markets in general, and as a result\nthose markets may attract more speculators\nthan the securities markets do. Increased\nparticipation by speculators in those markets\nmay cause temporary price distortions. Due to\nthe possibility of price distortion, even a\ncorrect forecast of general market trends by\nthe Adviser still may not result in a\nsuccessful derivatives activity over a very\nshort time period. The risk of a position in a\nfutures contract or other exchange-traded\nderivative may be very large compared to the\nrelatively low level of margin the Fund is\nrequired to deposit. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its exchange-traded\nderivatives transactions. The Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with\nits transactions in futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives. In the\nevent of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, the\nFund may not be able to recover all (or any)\nof the margin it has posted with the futures\ncommission merchant, or to realize the value\nof any increase in the price of its positions,\nor it may experience a significant delay in\ndoing so. The Fund also may be delayed or\nprevented from recovering margin or other\namounts deposited with a futures commission\nmerchant or futures clearinghouse. The\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the\n\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have\nestablished limits referred to as \u201cspeculative\nposition limits\u201d on the maximum net long or\nnet short positions that any person and\ncertain affiliated entities may hold or\ncontrol in a particular futures contract.\nTrading limits are imposed on the number of\ncontracts that any person may trade on a\nparticular trading day. An exchange may order\nthe liquidation of positions found to be in\nviolation of these limits and it may impose\nsanctions or restrictions. In addition, the\nDodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to establish\nspeculative position limits on certain\ncommodity futures contracts and their\neconomically equivalent futures, options and\nswaps. Regulatory action taken by the CFTC to\nestablish these additional position limits may\nadversely affect the market liquidity of the\nfutures, options and economically equivalent\nderivatives in which the Fund may invest. It\nis possible that, as a result of such limits,\nthe Fund's Adviser will be precluded from\ntaking positions in certain futures contracts\nor over-the-counter derivatives as a result of\npositions held by other clients of the Adviser\nor by the Adviser or its affiliates\nthemselves. Futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives traded on markets\noutside the U.S. are not generally subject to\nthe same level of regulation by the CFTC or\nother U.S. regulatory entities as contracts\ntraded in the U.S., including without\nlimitation as to the execution, delivery, and\nclearing of transactions. U.S. regulators\nneither 297 Table of Contents regulate the\nactivities of a foreign exchange, nor have the\npower to compel enforcement of the rules of\nthe foreign exchange or the laws of the\nforeign country in question. Margin and other\npayments made by a Fund may not be afforded\nthe same protections as are afforded those\npayments in the U.S., including in connection\nwith the insolvency of an executing or\nclearing broker or a clearinghouse or\nexchange. Certain foreign futures contracts\nand other exchange-traded derivatives may be\nless liquid and more volatile than U.S.\ncontracts. Dividend Paying Securities Risk .\nSecurities that pay dividends, as a group, can\nfall out of favor with the market, causing\nsuch companies to underperform companies that\ndo not pay dividends. In addition, changes in\nthe dividend policies of the companies held by\na Fund or the capital resources available for\nsuch company's dividend payments may adversely\naffect the Fund. Drone Companies Risk . Drone\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel and\nare subject to the risks of changes in\nbusiness cycles, world economic growth,\ntechnological progress, and government\nregulation. Securities of drone companies,\nespecially smaller, start-up companies, tend\nto be more volatile than securities of\ncompanies that do not rely heavily on\ntechnology. These companies may face intense\ncompetition and potentially rapid product\nobsolescence. In addition, drone companies may\nbe dependent on the U.S. government and its\nagencies for a significant portion of their\nsales, and their success and growth may be\ndependent on their ability to win future\ngovernment contracts. As a result, such\ncompanies may be negatively affected by\nbudgetary constraints, spending reductions,\ncongressional appropriations, and\nadministrative allocations of funds that\naffect the U.S. government and its agencies.\nDrone companies may rely on a combination of\npatents, copyrights, trademarks and trade\nsecret laws to establish and protect their\nproprietary rights in their products and\ntechnologies, and may be adversely affected by\nloss or impairment of those rights. Legal and\nregulatory changes may have an impact on a\ndrone company's products or services. In\naddition, drone companies may also be subject\nto increasing regulatory constraints that may\nlimit the sale or use of a company's products,\nincluding the need to obtain regulatory\napprovals from certain government agencies.\nDrone companies typically engage in\nsignificant amounts of spending on research\nand development, and there is no guarantee\nthat the products or services produced by\nthese companies will be successful.\nElectronics Companies Risk. Electronics\ncompanies can be significantly affected by\ncompetitive pressures, aggressive pricing,\ntechnological developments, changing domestic\ndemand, the ability to attract and retain\nskilled employees and availability and price\nof components. The market for products is\ncharacterized by rapidly changing technology,\nrapid product obsolescence, cyclical market\npatterns, evolving industry standards and\nfrequent new product introductions. The\nsuccess of electronics companies depends in\nsubstantial part on the timely and successful\nintroduction of new products. An unexpected\nchange in one or more of the technologies\naffecting an issuer's products or in the\nmarket for products based on a particular\ntechnology could have a material adverse\neffect on a participant's operating results.\nElectronic companies may rely on a combination\nof patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade\nsecret laws to establish and protect their\nproprietary rights in their products and\ntechnologies. There can be no assurance that\nthe steps taken by such companies to protect\ntheir proprietary rights will be adequate to\nprevent misappropriation of their technology\nor that competitors will not independently\ndevelop technologies that are substantially\nequivalent or superior to such companies'\ntechnology. Emerging Markets Risk .\nInvestments in emerging markets are generally\nsubject to a greater risk of loss than\ninvestments in developed markets. This may be\ndue to, among other things, the possibility of\ngreater market volatility, lower trading\nvolume and liquidity, greater risk of\nexpropriation, nationalization, and social,\npolitical and economic instability, greater\nreliance on a few industries, international\ntrade or revenue from particular commodities,\nless developed accounting, legal and\nregulatory systems, higher levels of\ninflation, deflation or currency devaluation,\ngreater risk of market shut down, and more\nsignificant governmental limitations on\ninvestment policy as compared to those\ntypically found in a developed market. In\naddition, issuers (including governments) in\nemerging market countries may have less\nfinancial stability than in other countries.\nThe securities of emerging market companies\nmay trade less frequently and in smaller\nvolumes than more widely held securities.\nMarket disruptions or substantial market\ncorrections may limit very significantly the\nliquidity of securities of certain companies\nin a particular country or geographic region,\nor of all companies in the country or region.\nA Fund may be unable to liquidate its\npositions in such securities at any time, or\nat a favorable price, in order to meet the\nFund's obligations. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as\nembargo and acts of war. As a result, there\nwill tend to be an increased risk of price\nvolatility in investments in emerging market\ncountries, which may be magnified by currency\nfluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar.\nSettlement and asset custody practices for\ntransactions in emerging markets may differ\nfrom those in 298 Table of Contents developed\nmarkets. Such differences may include possible\ndelays in settlement and certain settlement\npractices, such as delivery of securities\nprior to receipt of payment, which increase\nthe likelihood of a \u201cfailed settlement.\u201d\nFailed settlements can result in losses. For\nthese and other reasons, investments in\nemerging markets are often considered\nspeculative. Energy Sector Risk . Issuers in\nenergy-related industries can be significantly\naffected by fluctuations in energy prices and\nsupply and demand of energy fuels caused by\ngeopolitical events, energy conservation or\nuse of alternative fuel sources, the success\nof exploration projects, weather or\nmeteorological events, taxes, increased\ngovernmental or environmental regulation,\nresource depletion, rising interest rates,\ndeclines in domestic or foreign production,\naccidents or catastrophic events, or terrorist\nthreats or attacks, among others. Markets for\nvarious energy-related commodities can have\nsignificant volatility, and are subject to\ncontrol or manipulation by large producers or\npurchasers. Companies in the energy sector may\nneed to make substantial expenditures, and to\nincur significant amounts of debt, in order to\nmaintain or expand their reserves through\nexploration of new sources of supply, through\nthe development of existing sources, through\nacquisitions, or through long-term contracts\nto acquire reserves. Factors adversely\naffecting producers, refiners, distributors,\nor others in the energy sector may affect\nadversely companies that service or supply\nthose entities, either because demand for\nthose services or products is curtailed, or\nthose services or products come under price\npressure. Equity Investing Risk . The market\nprices of equity securities owned by a Fund\nmay go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The value of a security may\ndecline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer, such as\nmanagement performance, financial leverage,\nnon-compliance with regulatory requirements,\nand reduced demand for the issuer's goods or\nservices. The values of equity securities also\nmay decline due to general industry or market\nconditions that are not specifically related\nto a particular company, such as real or\nperceived adverse economic conditions, changes\nin the general outlook for corporate earnings,\nchanges in interest or currency rates, or\nadverse investor sentiment generally. In\naddition, equity markets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause stock prices to fall\nover short or extended periods of time. ESG\nInvesting Risk . An Index's incorporation of\nenvironmental, social and/or governance\nconsiderations in its methodology may cause a\nFund to make different investments than funds\nthat do not incorporate such considerations in\ntheir investment strategy or processes. An\nIndex's incorporation of ESG considerations\nmay affect a Fund's exposure to certain\nsectors and/or types of investments, and may\nadversely impact a Fund's performance\ndepending on whether such sectors or\ninvestments are in or out of favor in the\nmarket. In addition, a Fund's investments in\ncertain companies may be susceptible to\nvarious factors that may impact their\nbusinesses or operations, including costs\nassociated with government budgetary\nconstraints that impact publicly funded\nprojects and clean energy initiatives, the\neffects of general economic conditions\nthroughout the world, increased competition\nfrom other providers of services, unfavorable\ntax laws or accounting policies and high\nleverage. Each Index methodology incorporates\ndata and scores provided by third parties,\nwhich may be limited or only take into account\none or a few of many ESG related components of\nportfolio companies. In addition, ESG\ninformation and scores across third party data\nproviders, indexes and other funds may differ\nand/or be incomparable. A Fund may invest in\ncompanies that do not reflect the beliefs and\nvalues of any particular investor. Financial\nInstitutions Risk . Some instruments are\nissued or guaranteed by financial\ninstitutions, such as banks and brokers, or\nare collateralized by securities issued or\nguaranteed by financial institutions. Changes\nin the creditworthiness of any of these\ninstitutions may adversely affect the values\nof instruments of issuers in financial\nindustries. Financial institutions may be\nparticularly sensitive to certain economic\nfactors such as interest rate changes, adverse\ndevelopments in the real estate market, fiscal\nand monetary policy and general economic\ncycles. Adverse developments in banking and\nother financial industries may cause a Fund to\nunderperform relative to other funds that\ninvest more broadly across different\nindustries or have a smaller exposure to\nfinancial institutions. Changes in\ngovernmental regulation and oversight of\nfinancial institutions may have an adverse\neffect on the financial condition or the\nearnings or operations of a financial\ninstitution and on the types and amounts of\nbusinesses in which a financial institution\nmay engage. An investor may be delayed or\nprevented from exercising certain remedies\nagainst a financial institution. The amount of\na Fund's assets that may be invested in any\nfinancial institution, or financial\ninstitutions generally, may be limited by\napplicable law. 299 Table of Contents\nFinancial Sector Risk. Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation which may limit both\nthe amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may\ncause an unusually high degree of volatility\nin the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to\nraise capital (such as the issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or cease operations.\nCredit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses\nassociated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or\npolitical developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage\nfinance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk\n. The net asset value of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate with changes in the market\nvalue of a Fund's securities holdings. The\nmarket prices of Fund Shares will generally\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in a\nFund's net asset value and supply and demand\nof Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be\npredicted whether Fund Shares will trade\nbelow, at or above their net asset value.\nPrice differences may be due, in large part,\nto the fact that supply and demand forces at\nwork in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not\nidentical to, the same forces influencing the\nprices of the securities of an Index trading\nindividually or in the aggregate at any point\nin time. The market prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the net asset value\nof Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares\ncan be created and redeemed in Creation Units\n(unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable discounts\nfrom, and sometimes at premiums to, their net\nasset value), the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to a\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from such Fund's net asset\nvalue. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto the net asset value of Fund Shares or sells\nat a time when the market price is at a\ndiscount to the net asset value of Fund\nShares, then the investor may sustain losses.\nFossil Fuel Reserves Free Ownership Risk. The\nlack of ownership of fossil fuel reserves may\npotentially have an adverse effect on a\ncompany's profitability. The returns on a\nportfolio of securities that seeks to exclude\ncompanies that own fossil fuel reserves may\ntrail the returns on a portfolio of securities\nthat includes companies that own fossil fuel\nreserves. Investing in a portfolio of\nsecurities of companies that do not own fossil\nfuel reserves may affect a Fund's exposure to\ncertain types of investments and may impact\nthe Fund's relative investment performance\ndepending on whether such investments are in\nor out of favor in the market. Growth Stock\nRisk. The prices of growth stocks may be based\nlargely on expectations of future earnings,\nand their prices can decline rapidly and\nsignificantly in reaction to negative news\nabout such factors as earnings, revenues, the\neconomy, political developments, or other\nnews. Growth stocks may underperform value\nstocks and stocks in other broad style\ncategories (and the stock market as a whole)\nover any period of time and may shift in and\nout of favor with investors generally,\nsometimes rapidly, depending on changes in\nmarket, economic, and other factors. As a\nresult, at times when it holds substantial\ninvestments in growth stocks, a Fund may\nunderperform other investment funds that\ninvest more broadly or that favor different\ninvestment styles. Because growth companies\ntypically reinvest their earnings, growth\nstocks typically do not pay dividends at\nlevels associated with other types of stocks,\nif at all. Health Care Equipment Companies\nRisk : Health care equipment companies are\naffected by rising costs of medical products,\ndevices and services and the increased\nemphasis on the delivery of health care\nthrough outpatient services. Competition is\nhigh among health care equipment companies and\ncan be significantly affected by extensive\ngovernment regulation or government\nreimbursement for medical expenses. The\nequipment may be subject to extensive\nlitigation based on malpractice claims,\nproduct liability claims or other litigation.\nMedical equipment 300 Table of Contents\nmanufacturers are heavily dependent on patent\nprotection and the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect their profitability. Many new\nhealth care products are subject to the\napproval of the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The process of\nobtaining FDA approval is often long and\nexpensive. Health Care Sector Risk . Companies\nin the health care sector are subject to\nextensive government regulation and their\nprofitability can be significantly affected by\nrestrictions on government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure\n(including price discounting), limited product\nlines and an increased emphasis on the\ndelivery of healthcare through outpatient\nservices. Companies in the health care sector\nare heavily dependent on obtaining and\ndefending patents, which may be time consuming\nand costly, and the expiration of patents may\nalso adversely affect the profitability of\nthese companies. Health care companies are\nalso subject to extensive litigation based on\nproduct liability and similar claims. In\naddition, their products can become obsolete\ndue to industry innovation, changes in\ntechnologies or other market developments.\nMany new products in the health care sector\nrequire significant research and development\nand may be subject to regulatory approvals,\nall of which may be time consuming and costly\nwith no guarantee that any product will come\nto market. Health Care Services Companies Risk\n. Health care services companies are affected\nby rising costs of medical products, devices\nand services and the increased emphasis on the\ndelivery of health care through outpatient\nservices. Competition is high among health\ncare services companies and can be\nsignificantly affected by extensive government\nregulation or government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses. The equipment may be subject\nto extensive litigation based on malpractice\nclaims, product liability claims or other\nlitigation. Medical equipment manufacturers\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe expiration of patents may adversely affect\ntheir profitability. Many new health care\nproducts are subject to the approval of the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The\nprocess of obtaining FDA approval is often\nlong and expensive. Homebuilding Companies\nRisk . Homebuilding companies can be\nsignificantly affected by the national,\nregional and local real estate markets.\nHomebuilding companies are also sensitive to\ninterest rate fluctuations which can cause\nchanges in the availability of mortgage\ncapital and directly affect the purchasing\npower of potential homebuyers. Homebuilding\ncompanies can be significantly affected by\nchanges in government spending, consumer\nconfidence, demographic patterns and the level\nof new and existing home sales. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk . Each Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities. Each Fund will\nseek to replicate Index returns, regardless of\nthe current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising\nthe Index. This differs from an actively-\nmanaged fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. Each Fund\ngenerally will buy and will not sell a\nsecurity included in the Index as long as the\nsecurity is part of the Index regardless of\nany sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the\nsecurity, even though the Adviser may make a\ndifferent investment decision for other\nactively managed accounts or portfolios that\nhold the security. As a result, a Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms and\nby comparison with other indices) and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index\nin accordance with its methodology may occur\nfrom time to time and may not be identified\nand corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on a Fund and its shareholders.\nWhile the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with the Index), a\nFund's return may not match the return of the\nIndex for a number of reasons. For example,\nthe return on the sample of securities\npurchased by a Fund (or the return on\nsecurities not included in the Index) to\nreplicate the performance of the Index may not\ncorrelate precisely with the return of the\nIndex. Each Fund incurs a number of operating\nexpenses not applicable to the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying and selling securities.\nIn addition, a Fund may not be fully invested\nat times, either as a result of cash flows\ninto or out of the Fund or reserves of cash\nheld by the Fund to meet redemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to trackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between a\nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes\nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact a Fund's ability\nto match the return of the Index. The Adviser\nmay apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment\ntechniques to refine or limit the number or\ntypes of issuers included in the Index in\nwhich a Fund may invest. Application of such\nscreens or techniques may result in investment\nperformance below that of the Index and may\nnot produce results expected by the Adviser.\nIndex tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. 301 Table of\nContents Pursuant to each Index methodology, a\nsecurity may be removed from an Index in the\nevent that it does not comply with the\neligibility requirements of the Index. As a\nresult, a Fund may be forced to sell\nsecurities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the\nIndex components. When there are changes made\nto the component securities of an Index and\nthe corresponding Fund in turn makes similar\nchanges to its portfolio to attempt to\nincrease the correlation between the Fund's\nportfolio and the Index, any transaction costs\nand market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled\nchanges to an Index may expose the\ncorresponding Fund to additional tracking\nerror risk. A Fund may recognize gains as a\nresult of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the corresponding\nIndex. A Fund also may be required to\ndistribute any such gains to its shareholders\nto avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. Industrial Sector Risk .\nIndustrial companies are affected by supply\nand demand both for their specific product or\nservice and for industrial sector products in\ngeneral. Government regulation, world events,\nexchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil\nliabilities will likewise affect the\nperformance of these companies. Aerospace and\ndefense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry\nrely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products\nand services. Thus, the financial condition\nof, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which\nare typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol the U.S. (and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation securities, a\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are\ncyclical and have occasional sharp price\nmovements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Infrastructure-Related\nCompanies Risk . Infrastructure-related\ncompanies include companies that primarily\nown, manage, develop and/or operate\ninfrastructure assets, including\ntransportation, utility, energy and/or\ntelecommunications assets. Infrastructure-\nrelated businesses are subject to a variety of\nfactors that may adversely affect their\nbusiness or operations, including high\ninterest costs in connection with capital\nconstruction programs, insurance costs, costs\nassociated with environmental and other\nregulations, the effects of an economic\nslowdown, surplus capacity or technological\nobsolescence, industry competition, labor\nrelations, rate caps or rate changes,\nuncertainties concerning availability of fuel\nat reasonable prices, the effects of energy\nconservation policies, natural disasters,\nterrorist attacks and other factors. Certain\ninfrastructure-related entities, particularly\ntelecommunications and utilities companies,\nare subject to extensive regulation by various\ngovernmental authorities. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failures to receive required\nregulatory approvals or the enactment of new\nadverse regulatory requirements may adversely\naffect infrastructure-related companies.\nInfrastructure-related companies may also be\naffected by service interruption and/or legal\nchallenges due to environmental, operational\nor other conditions or events, and the\nimposition of special tariffs and changes in\ntax laws, regulatory policies and accounting\nstandards. There is also the risk that\ncorruption may negatively affect publicly-\nfunded infrastructure projects, especially in\nnon-U.S. markets, resulting in work stoppage,\ndelays and cost overruns. Other risks\nassociated with infrastructure-related\ncompanies include uncertainties resulting from\nsuch companies' diversification into new\ndomestic and international businesses, as well\nas agreements by any such companies linking\nfuture rate increases to inflation or other\nfactors not directly related to the actual\noperating profits of the enterprise. Insurance\nCompanies Risk . Insurance companies' profits\nare affected by many factors, including\ninterest rate movements, the imposition of\npremium rate caps, competition and pressure to\ncompete globally. Certain types of insurance\ncompanies may also be affected by weather\ncatastrophes and other disasters and mortality\nrates. In addition, although insurance\ncompanies are currently subject to extensive\nregulation, such companies may be adversely\naffected by increased governmental regulations\nor tax law changes in the future. Internet\nSegment Risk . Internet companies are subject\nto rapid changes in technology, worldwide\ncompetition, rapid obsolescence of products\nand services, loss of patent protections,\ncyclical market patterns, evolving industry\nstandards and frequent new product\nintroductions. Competitive pressures, such as\ntechnological developments, fixed-rate pricing\nand the ability to attract and retain skilled\nemployees, can significantly affect internet\ncompanies, and changing domestic and\ninternational demand, research and development\ncosts, availability and price components and\nproduct obsolescence also can affect their\nprofitability. 302 Table of Contents Large-\nCapitalization Securities Risk. Securities\nissued by large-capitalization companies may\npresent risks not present in smaller\ncompanies. For example, larger companies may\nbe unable to respond as quickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to competitive challenges\nor to changes in business, product, financial,\nor other market conditions. Larger companies\nmay not be able to maintain growth at the high\nrates that may be achieved by well-managed\nsmaller and mid-sized companies, especially\nduring strong economic periods. Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies\ncould trail the returns on investments in\nsecurities of smaller and mid-sized companies.\nLeveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,\nreverse repurchase agreements, certain\nderivatives transactions, securities lending\ntransactions and other investment transactions\nsuch as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or\nforward commitment transactions may create\ninvestment leverage. If a Fund engages in\ntransactions that have a leveraging effect on\nthe Fund's investment portfolio, the value of\nthe Fund will be potentially more volatile and\nall other risks will tend to be compounded.\nThis is because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than a Fund would otherwise have and\nso magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses to a Fund. Certain\nderivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause a\nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to\nmeet asset segregation or coverage\nrequirements. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk\nis the risk that a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of securities or close out derivatives\ntransactions readily at a favorable time or\nprices (or at all) or at prices approximating\nthose at which a Fund currently values them.\nFor example, certain investments may be\nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade\nin the over-the-counter market or in limited\nvolume, or may not have an active trading\nmarket. Illiquid securities may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for a Fund to value illiquid\nsecurities accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. Disposal of illiquid\nsecurities may entail registration expenses\nand other transaction costs that are higher\nthan those for liquid securities. A Fund may\nseek to borrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of\nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing\nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund.\nLow Volatility Risk. Although subject to the\nrisks of common stocks, low volatility stocks\nare seen as having a lower risk profile than\nthe overall markets. However, a portfolio\ncomprised of low volatility stocks may not\nproduce investment exposure that has lower\nvariability to changes in such stocks' price\nlevels. Low volatility stocks are likely to\nunderperform the broader market during periods\nof rapidly rising stock prices. Market Risk .\nMarket prices of investments held by a Fund\nwill go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. A Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile,\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in a\nFund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities\nprices. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments. An outbreak of a respiratory\ndisease caused by a novel coronavirus (known\nas COVID-19) first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has resulted in a global\npandemic and major disruptions to economies\nand markets around the world, including the\nUnited States. Financial markets have\nexperienced extreme volatility and severe\nlosses, and trading in many instruments has\nbeen disrupted. Liquidity for many instruments\nhas been greatly reduced for periods of time.\nSome interest rates are very low and in some\ncases yields are negative. Governments and\ncentral banks, including the Federal Reserve\nin the United States, have taken extraordinary\nand unprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.\nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some\ntime. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19,\nand measures taken to mitigate its effects,\ncould result in disruptions to the services\nprovided to a Fund by its service providers.\n303 Table of Contents Materials Sector Risk.\nMany materials companies are significantly\naffected by the level and volatility of\ncommodity prices, exchange rates, import\ncontrols, worldwide competition, environmental\npolicies and consumer demand. At times,\nworldwide production of industrial materials\nhas exceeded demand as a result of over-\nbuilding or economic downturns, leading to\npoor investment returns or losses. Other risks\nmay include liabilities for environmental\ndamage and general civil liabilities,\ndepletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control.\nThe materials sector may also be affected by\neconomic cycles, technical progress, labor\nrelations, and government regulations. Metals\nand Mining Companies Risk. Metals and mining\ncompanies can be significantly affected by\nevents relating to international political and\neconomic developments, energy conservation,\nthe success of exploration projects, commodity\nprices, and tax and other government\nregulations. Investments in metals and mining\ncompanies may be speculative and may be\nsubject to greater price volatility than\ninvestments in other types of companies. Risks\nof metals and mining investments include:\nchanges in international monetary policies or\neconomic and political conditions that can\naffect the supply of precious metals and\nconsequently the value of metals and mining\ncompany investments; the United States or\nforeign governments may pass laws or\nregulations limiting metals investments for\nstrategic or other policy reasons; and\nincreased environmental or labor costs may\ndepress the value of metals and mining\ninvestments. Mid-Capitalization Securities\nRisk . The securities of mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile and may involve\nmore risk than the securities of larger\ncompanies. These companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets or financial resources,\nmay lack the competitive strength of larger\ncompanies, and may depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition, these companies may\nhave been recently organized and may have\nlittle or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than\nmore widely held securities. The prices of\nthese securities may fluctuate more sharply\nthan those of other securities, and a Fund may\nexperience some difficulty in establishing or\nclosing out positions in these securities at\nprevailing market prices. There may be less\npublicly available information about the\nissuers of these securities or less market\ninterest in these securities than in the case\nof larger companies, both of which can cause\nsignificant price volatility. Some securities\nof mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may be\nrestricted as to resale. Returns on\ninvestments in securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of larger\nor smaller companies. Momentum Risk . The Fund\nemploys a \u201cmomentum\u201d style of investing that\nemphasizes investing in securities that have\nhad higher recent price performance compared\nto other securities. This style of investing\nis subject to the risk that these securities\nmay be more volatile than a broad cross-\nsection of securities or that the returns on\nsecurities that have previously exhibited\nprice momentum are less than returns on other\nstyles of investing or the overall stock\nmarket. Momentum can turn quickly and cause\nsignificant variation from other types of\ninvestments. New Economies Companies Risk .\nThe companies included in the Index are\nengaged in emerging industries and new\ntechnologies that may be unproven. Such\nindustries and technologies may be adversely\naffected by technological advances,\ncompetition, rapid product or service\nobsolescence, and new and evolving\nregulations. Companies included in the Index\nmay rely on a combination of patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws\nto establish and protect their proprietary\nrights in their products and technologies, and\nmay be adversely affected by loss or\nimpairment of those rights. In addition,\ncompanies in the Index may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. The Index may include stocks of\nsmaller, less-seasoned companies that may be\nmore volatile than the overall market. New\nFund Risk . The Fund is new and there is no\nassurance that the Fund will grow quickly.\nWhen the Fund's size is small, the Fund may\nexperience low trading volume, which could\nlead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif the Fund does not meet certain conditions\nof the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could cause elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its shareholders. Non-\nDiversification Risk . Funds classified as\n\u201cnon-diversified\u201d may hold a smaller number of\nportfolio securities than many other funds. To\nthe extent a Fund invests in a relatively\nsmall number of issuers, a decline in the\nmarket value of a particular security held by\nthe Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. A diversified Fund may become non-\ndiversified (or vice versa) for periods of\ntime solely as a result of changes in the\ncomposition of the Index (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or more component\nsecurities). 304 Table of Contents Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Investments in securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) entail risks not typically\nassociated with investing in securities of\nU.S. issuers. Similar risks may apply to\nsecurities traded on a U.S. securities\nexchange that are issued by entities with\nsignificant exposure to non-U.S. countries. In\ncertain countries, legal remedies available to\ninvestors may be more limited than those\navailable with regard to U.S. investments.\nBecause non-U.S. securities are typically\ndenominated and traded in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar, the value of the Fund's\nassets, to the extent they are non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated, may be affected favorably or\nunfavorably by currency exchange rates,\nexchange control regulations, and restrictions\nor prohibitions on the repatriation of\nnon-U.S. currencies. To the extent underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are closed when the exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of\nan underlying security and the last quoted\nprice for the underlying security on the\nclosed foreign market. These deviations could\nresult in the Fund experiencing premiums or\ndiscounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Income and\ngains with respect to investments in certain\ncountries may be subject to withholding and\nother taxes. There may be less information\npublicly available about a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S.\nentities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, and financial reporting standards,\nregulatory framework and practices comparable\nto those in the United States. The securities\nof some non-U.S. entities are less liquid and\nat times more volatile than securities of\ncomparable U.S. entities, and could become\nsubject to sanctions or embargoes that\nadversely affect a Fund's investment. Non-U.S.\ntransaction costs, such as brokerage\ncommissions and custody costs may be higher\nthan in the U.S. In addition, there may be a\npossibility of nationalization or\nexpropriation of assets, imposition of\ncurrency exchange controls, confiscatory\ntaxation, and diplomatic developments that\ncould adversely affect the values of a Fund's\ninvestments in certain non-U.S. countries.\nInvestments in securities of non-U.S. issuers\nalso are subject to foreign political and\neconomic risk not associated with U.S.\ninvestments, meaning that political events\n(civil unrest, national elections, changes in\npolitical conditions and foreign relations,\nimposition of exchange controls and\nrepatriation restrictions), social and\neconomic events (labor strikes, rising\ninflation) and natural disasters occurring in\na country where a Fund invests could cause the\nFund's investments in that country to\nexperience gains or losses. Oil and Gas\nCompanies Risk . Oil and gas companies develop\nand produce crude oil and natural gas and\nprovide drilling and other energy resources\nproduction and distribution related services.\nStock prices for these types of companies are\naffected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for energy\nproducts in general. The price of oil and gas,\nexploration and production spending,\ngovernment regulation, world events and\neconomic conditions will likewise affect the\nperformance of these companies.\nCorrespondingly, securities of companies in\nthe energy field are subject to swift price\nand supply fluctuations caused by events\nrelating to international politics, energy\nconservation, the success of exploration\nprojects, and tax and other governmental\nregulatory policies. Weak demand for the\ncompanies' products or services or for energy\nproducts and services in general, as well as\nnegative developments in these other areas,\nwould adversely impact the Fund's performance.\nOil and gas equipment and services can be\nsignificantly affected by natural disasters as\nwell as changes in exchange rates, interest\nrates, government regulation, world events and\neconomic conditions. These companies may be at\nrisk for environmental damage claims.\nPharmaceuticals Companies Risk .\nPharmaceutical companies are heavily dependent\non patent protection. The expiration of\npatents may adversely affect the profitability\nof the companies. Pharmaceutical companies are\nalso subject to extensive litigation based on\nproduct liability and other similar claims.\nMany new products are subject to approval of\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d).\nThe process of obtaining FDA approval can be\nlong and costly and approved products are\nsusceptible to obsolescence. Pharmaceutical\ncompanies are also subject to heavy\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult\nto raise prices and, in fact, may result in\nprice discounting. Preferred Securities Risk .\nGenerally, preferred security holders have no\nor limited voting rights with respect to the\nissuing company. In addition, preferred\nsecurities are subordinated to bonds and other\ndebt instruments in a company's capital\nstructure and therefore will be subject to\ngreater credit risk than those debt\ninstruments. Unlike debt securities, dividend\npayments on a preferred security typically\nmust be declared by the issuer's board of\ndirectors. An issuer's board of directors is\ngenerally not under any obligation to pay a\ndividend (even if such dividends have\naccrued), and may suspend payment of dividends\non preferred securities at any time.\nTherefore, in the event an issuer of preferred\nsecurities experiences economic difficulties,\nthe issuer's preferred securities may lose\nsubstantial value due to the reduced\nlikelihood that the issuer's board of\ndirectors will declare a dividend and the fact\nthat the preferred security may be\nsubordinated to other securities of the same\nissuer. Further, because many preferred\nsecurities pay 305 Table of Contents dividends\nat a fixed rate, their market price can be\nsensitive to changes in interest rates in a\nmanner similar to bonds - that is, as interest\nrates rise, the value of the preferred\nsecurities held by a Fund are likely to\ndecline. Therefore, to the extent that a Fund\ninvests a substantial portion of its assets in\nfixed rate preferred securities, rising\ninterest rates may cause the value of the\nFund's investments to decline significantly.\nIn addition, because many preferred securities\nallow holders to convert the preferred\nsecurities into common stock of the issuer,\ntheir market price can be sensitive to changes\nin the value of the issuer's common stock and,\ntherefore, declining common stock values may\nalso cause the value of a Fund's investments\nto decline. Preferred securities often have\ncall features which allow the issuer to redeem\nthe security at its discretion. The redemption\nof a preferred security having a higher than\naverage yield may cause a decrease in a Fund's\nyield. Quality Risk . A \u201cquality\u201d style of\ninvesting emphasizes companies with high\nreturns on equity, stable earnings per share\ngrowth, and low financial leverage. This style\nof investing is subject to the risk that the\npast performance of these companies does not\ncontinue or that the returns on \u201cquality\u201d\nequity securities are less than returns on\nother styles of investing or the overall stock\nmarket. Real Estate Sector Risk . There are\nspecial risks associated with investment in\nsecurities of companies engaged in real\nproperty markets, including without limitation\nreal estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) and\nreal estate operating companies. An investment\nin a real property company may be subject to\nrisks similar to those associated with direct\nownership of real estate, including, by way of\nexample, the possibility of declines in the\nvalue of real estate, losses from casualty or\ncondemnation, and changes in local and general\neconomic conditions, supply and demand,\ninterest rates, environmental liability,\nzoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents,\nproperty taxes, and operating expenses. An\ninvestment in a real property company is\nsubject to additional risks, such as poor\nperformance by the manager of the real\nproperty company, adverse changes in tax laws,\ndifficulties in valuing and disposing of real\nestate, and the effect of general declines in\nstock prices. Some real property companies\nhave limited diversification because they\ninvest in a limited number of properties, a\nnarrow geographic area, or a single type of\nproperty. Also, the organizational documents\nof a real property company may contain\nprovisions that make changes in control of the\ncompany difficult and time-consuming. As a\nshareholder in a real property company, a\nFund, and indirectly a Fund's shareholders,\nwould bear their ratable shares of the real\nproperty company's expenses and would at the\nsame time continue to pay their own fees and\nexpenses. REIT Risk . REITs are subject to the\nrisks associated with investing in the real\nestate sector in general. In particular, a\nREIT may be affected by changes in the values\nof the properties that the REIT owns or\noperates or that underlie the mortgages or\nsimilar real estate interests in which the\nREIT invests. In addition, REITs may be\naffected by changes to interest rates or\nproperty taxes. Further, REITs are dependent\nupon specialized management skills, and their\ninvestments may be concentrated in relatively\nfew properties, or in a small geographic area\nor a single property type. REITs are also\nsubject to heavy cash flow dependency and, as\na result, are particularly reliant on the\nproper functioning of capital markets. In the\nevent of a default by a borrower or lessee,\nthe REIT may experience delays in enforcing\nits rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may\nincur substantial costs associated with\nprotecting its investments. Investments in\nREITs are also subject to the risks affecting\nequity markets generally. In addition, a REIT\ncould fail to qualify for favorable tax or\nregulatory treatment, which could have adverse\nconsequences for a Fund. Smaller\ncapitalization REITs may be more volatile and\nmay involve more risk than larger\ncapitalization REITs. Equity REITs earn income\nfrom leasing properties and realize gains and\nlosses from the sale of properties. Equity\nREITs may be affected by conditions in the\nreal estate rental market and by changes in\nthe value of the properties they own. A\ndecline in rental income may occur because of\nextended vacancies, limitations on rents,\nfailure to collect rents or increased\ncompetition from other rental properties. In\naddition, rising interest rates may increase\nthe costs of obtaining financing for real\nestate projects, which may cause the value of\nan equity REIT to decline. Mortgage REITs\nreceive principal and interest payments from\nthe owners of mortgage properties.\nAccordingly, mortgage REITs are subject to the\ncredit risk of the borrowers, which refers to\nthe possibility that the borrower will be\nunable and/or unwilling to make timely\ninterest payments and/or repay the principal\non the loan to the mortgage REIT when due. If\na mortgage REIT is required to foreclose on a\nborrower, the amount recovered in connection\nwith the foreclosure may be less than the\namount owed to the mortgage REIT. In addition,\nif a borrower refinances or prepays a\nmortgage, a mortgage REIT's yield may decline.\nRetail Companies Risk . Retail companies can\nbe significantly affected by the performance\nof the domestic and international economy,\nconsumer confidence and spending, intense\ncompetition, changes in demographics, and\nchanging consumer tastes and preferences. 306\nTable of Contents Semiconductor Companies\nRisk. A Fund is subject to the risk that\nmarket or economic factors impacting\nsemiconductor companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technological advances could\nhave a major effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. The value of stocks of\nsemiconductor companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technology is particularly\nvulnerable to rapid changes in product cycles,\nrapid product obsolescence, government\nregulation and competition, both domestically\nand internationally, including competition\nfrom foreign competitors with lower production\ncosts. Semiconductor companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-seasoned companies,\ntend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Additionally, semiconductor companies\nmay face dramatic and often unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for\nthe services of qualified personnel.\nSettlement Risk . Markets in different\ncountries have different clearance and\nsettlement procedures and in certain markets\nthere have been times when settlements have\nbeen unable to keep pace with the volume of\ntransactions. Delays in settlement may\nincrease credit risk to a Fund, limit the\nability of a Fund to reinvest the proceeds of\na sale of securities, hinder the ability of a\nFund to lend its portfolio securities, and\npotentially subject a Fund to penalties for\nits failure to deliver to on-purchasers of\nsecurities whose delivery to a Fund was\ndelayed. Delays in the settlement of\nsecurities purchased by a Fund may limit the\nability of a Fund to sell those securities at\ntimes and prices it considers desirable, and\nmay subject a Fund to losses and costs due to\nits own inability to settle with subsequent\npurchasers of the securities from it. A Fund\nmay be required to borrow monies it had\notherwise expected to receive in connection\nwith the settlement of securities sold by it,\nin order to meet its obligations to others.\nLimits on the ability of a Fund to purchase or\nsell securities due to settlement delays could\nincrease any variance between a Fund's\nperformance and that of its benchmark index.\nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk . The\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile and may involve more risk\nthan the securities of larger companies. These\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets or financial resources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of larger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been\nrecently organized and may have little or no\ntrack record of success. The securities of\nsmaller companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held\nsecurities. The prices of these securities may\nfluctuate more sharply than those of other\nsecurities, and a Fund may experience some\ndifficulty in establishing or closing out\npositions in these securities at prevailing\nmarket prices. There may be less publicly\navailable information about the issuers of\nthese securities or less market interest in\nthese securities than in the case of larger\ncompanies, both of which can cause significant\nprice volatility. Some securities of smaller\nissuers may be illiquid or may be restricted\nas to resale. A Fund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions in such securities at\nany time, or at a favorable price, in order to\nmeet a Fund's obligations. Returns on\ninvestments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of larger\ncompanies. Technology Sector Risk . Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major\neffect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies\nand companies that rely heavily on technology\nis particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from\nforeign competitors with lower production\ncosts. Technology companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual\nproperty rights, the loss or impairment of\nwhich may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology\nsector may face dramatic and often\nunpredictable changes in growth rates and\ncompetition for the services of qualified\npersonnel. Electronic Media Companies Risk:\nElectronic media companies create, own, and\ndistribute various forms of technology-based\nvisual, audio, and interactive content, as\nwell as information databases that they sell\nor lease to others. Electronic media companies\ncan be adversely affected by, among other\nthings, changes in government regulation,\nintense competition, dependency on patent\nprotection, and rapid obsolescence of products\nand services due to product compatibility or\nchanging consumer preferences.\nTelecommunications Sector Risk. The\ntelecommunications industry is subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals or the enactment of new\nadverse regulatory requirements may adversely\naffect the business of the telecommunications\ncompanies. The telecommunications industry can\nalso be significantly affected by intense\ncompetition, including 307 Table of Contents\ncompetition with alternative technologies such\nas wireless communications, product\ncompatibility, consumer preferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence and research and\ndevelopment of new products. Technological\ninnovations may make the products and services\nof telecommunications companies obsolete.\nOther risks include uncertainties resulting\nfrom such companies' diversification into new\ndomestic and international businesses, as well\nas agreements by any such companies linking\nfuture rate increases to inflation or other\nfactors not directly related to the actual\noperating profits of the enterprise.\nTransportation Companies Risk. Transportation\ncompanies can be significantly affected by\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor\nrelations, technology developments, exchange\nrates, insurance costs, industry competition\nand government regulation. Unconstrained\nSector Risk . A Fund may invest a substantial\nportion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may\nchange from time to time. When a Fund focuses\nits investments in a particular industry or\nsector, financial, economic, business, and\nother developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have\na greater effect on the Fund than if it had\nnot focused its assets in that industry,\nmarket, or economic sector, which may increase\nthe volatility of the Fund. Utilities Sector\nRisk. Utility companies are affected by supply\nand demand, operating costs, government\nregulation, environmental factors, liabilities\nfor environmental damage and general civil\nliabilities, and rate caps or rate changes.\nAlthough rate changes of a utility usually\nfluctuate in approximate correlation with\nfinancing costs, due to political and\nregulatory factors, rate changes ordinarily\noccur only following a delay after the changes\nin financing costs. This factor will tend to\nfavorably affect a regulated utility company's\nearnings and dividends in times of decreasing\ncosts, but conversely, will tend to adversely\naffect earnings and dividends when costs are\nrising. The value of regulated utility debt\nsecurities (and, to a lesser extent, equity\nsecurities) may tend to have an inverse\nrelationship to the movement of interest\nrates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. These\nopportunities may permit certain utility\ncompanies to earn more than their traditional\nregulated rates of return. Some companies,\nhowever, may be forced to defend their core\nbusiness and may be less profitable. In\naddition, natural disasters, terrorist\nattacks, government intervention or other\nfactors may render a utility company's\nequipment unusable or obsolete and negatively\nimpact profitability. Among the risks that may\naffect utility companies are the following:\nrisks of increases in fuel and other operating\ncosts; the high cost of borrowing to finance\ncapital construction during inflationary\nperiods; restrictions on operations and\nincreased costs and delays associated with\ncompliance with environmental and nuclear\nsafety regulations; and the difficulties\ninvolved in obtaining natural gas for resale\nor fuel for generating electricity at\nreasonable prices. Other risks include those\nrelated to the construction and operation of\nnuclear power plants, the effects of energy\nconservation and the effects of regulatory\nchanges. Valuation Risk . Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of a\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. Technological issues or other service\ndisruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause a Fund to value\nits investments incorrectly. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that a Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the\nvalue established for it at any time, and it\nis possible that a Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby a Fund at that time. Value Stock Risk.\nValue stocks present the risk that they may\ndecline in price or never reach their expected\nfull market value because the market fails to\nrecognize the stock's intrinsic worth. Value\nstocks may underperform growth stocks and\nstocks in other broad style categories (and\nthe stock market as a whole) over any period\nof time and may shift in and out of favor with\ninvestors generally, sometimes rapidly,\ndepending on changes in market, economic, and\nother factors. As a result, at times when it\nholds substantial investments in value stocks\na Fund may underperform other investment\nportfolios that invest more broadly or that\nfavor different investment styles. 308 Table\nof Contents Non-Principal Risks Each risk\ndiscussed below is a non-principal risk of a\nFund to the extent it is not identified as a\nprincipal risk for such Fund in the preceding\n\u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION - PRINCIPAL\nRISKS\u201d section. Authorized Participants,\nMarket Makers and Liquidity Providers\nConcentration Risk. A Fund has a limited\nnumber of financial institutions that may act\nas Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are\nresponsible for the creation and redemption\nactivity for a Fund. In addition, there may be\na limited number of market makers and/or\nliquidity providers in the marketplace. To the\nextent either of the following events occur,\nFund Shares may trade at a material discount\nto NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs\nexit the business or otherwise become unable\nto process creation and/or redemption orders\nand no other APs step forward to perform these\nservices, or (ii) market makers and/or\nliquidity providers exit the business or\nsignificantly reduce their business activities\nand no other entities step forward to perform\ntheir functions. Cash Transaction Risk . To\nthe extent that a Fund sells portfolio\nsecurities to meet some or all of a redemption\nrequest with cash, the Fund may incur taxable\ngains or losses that it might not have\nincurred had it made redemptions entirely in-\nkind. As a result, a Fund may pay out higher\nannual capital gain distributions than if the\nin-kind redemption process was used.\nConcentration Risk. A Fund's assets will\ngenerally be concentrated in an industry or\ngroup of industries to the extent that the\nFund's underlying Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nWhen a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a\nFund will be subject to a number of actual or\npotential conflicts of interest. For example,\nthe Adviser or its affiliates may provide\nservices to a Fund, such as securities lending\nagency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer\nagency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for\nwhich the Fund would compensate the Adviser\nand/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest\nin other pooled investment vehicles sponsored,\nmanaged, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of a\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements. The Adviser and its\naffiliates serve as investment adviser to\nother clients and may make investment\ndecisions that may be different from those\nthat will be made by the Adviser on behalf of\nthe Funds. For example, the Adviser may\nprovide asset allocation advice to some\nclients that may include a recommendation to\ninvest in or redeem from particular issuers\nwhile not providing that same recommendation\nto all clients invested in the same or similar\nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to\npurchase (or sell) investments for a Fund and\nto sell (or purchase) the same investment for\naccounts, funds, or structured products for\nwhich it serves as asset manager, or for other\nclients or affiliates. The Adviser and its\naffiliates may invest for clients in various\nsecurities that are senior, pari passuor\njunior to, or have interests different from or\nadverse to, the securities that are owned by a\nFund. The Adviser or its affiliates, in\nconnection with its other business activities,\nmay acquire material nonpublic confidential\ninformation that may restrict the Adviser from\npurchasing securities or selling securities\nfor itself or its clients (including the\nFunds) or otherwise using such information for\nthe benefit of its clients or itself. The\nforegoing does not purport to be a\ncomprehensive list or complete explanation of\nall potential conflicts of interests which may\naffect a Fund. A Fund may encounter\ncircumstances, or enter into transactions, in\nwhich conflicts of interest that are not\nlisted or discussed above may arise. Costs of\nBuying and Selling Shares . Investors buying\nor selling Fund Shares in the secondary market\nwill pay brokerage commissions or other\ncharges imposed by brokers, as determined by\nthat broker. Brokerage commissions are often a\nfixed amount and may be a significant\nproportional cost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell relatively small amounts of Fund\nShares. In addition, secondary market\ninvestors will also incur the cost of the\ndifference between the price that an investor\nis willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d\nprice) and the price at which an investor is\nwilling to sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price).\nThis difference in bid and ask prices is often\nreferred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask 309\n\nTable of Contents spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread\nvaries over time for Fund Shares based on\ntrading volume and market liquidity, and is\ngenerally lower if Fund Shares have more\ntrading volume and market liquidity and higher\nif Fund Shares have little trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask\nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,\nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may\nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Counterparty Risk . A Fund\nwill be subject to credit risk with respect to\nthe counterparties with which the Fund enters\ninto derivatives contracts and other\ntransactions such as repurchase agreements or\nreverse repurchase agreements. A Fund's\nability to profit from these types of\ninvestments and transactions will depend on\nthe willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate\nor realize any gain on the investment or\ntransaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund.\nA Fund may experience significant delays in\nobtaining any recovery in an insolvency,\nbankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding\ninvolving its counterparty (including recovery\nof any collateral posted by it) and may obtain\nonly a limited recovery or may obtain no\nrecovery in such circumstances. If a Fund\nholds collateral posted by its counterparty,\nit may be delayed or prevented from realizing\non the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if a Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another institution being\nsubstituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, a\nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the\nfinancial institution's authority, the\nfinancial institution's liabilities could be\nwritten down, eliminated or converted into\nequity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial\ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of its securities and, if a\nFund holds such securities or has entered into\na transaction with such a financial security\nwhen a bail-in occurs, such Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, funds (such as the Funds) and their\nservice providers (including the Adviser) may\nbe prone to operational and information\nsecurity risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. In general,\ncyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects.\nCyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from\naccessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns of, a Fund, the Adviser\nor a custodian, transfer agent, or other\naffiliated or third-party service provider may\nadversely affect a Fund or its shareholders.\nFor instance, cyber-attacks or technical\nmalfunctions may interfere with the processing\nof shareholder or other transactions, affect a\nFund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the\nrelease of private shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial\nlosses, reimbursement or other compensation\ncosts, and additional compliance costs. Cyber-\nattacks or technical malfunctions may render\nrecords of Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and\nother data integral to the functioning of a\nFund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete.\nA Fund may also incur substantial costs for\ncybersecurity risk management in order to\nprevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund\nand its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. While the Adviser has\nestablished business continuity plans and\nsystems designed to minimize the risk of\ncyber-attacks through the use of technology,\nprocesses and controls, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, given the evolving\nnature of this threat. Each Fund relies on\nthird-party service providers for many of its\nday-to-day operations, and will be subject to\nthe risk that the protections and protocols\nimplemented by those service providers will be\nineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-\nattack. The Adviser does not control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems put in place\nby third-party service providers, and such\nthird-party service providers may have limited\nindemnification obligations to the Adviser or\nthe Funds. Similar types of cybersecurity\nrisks or technical malfunctions also are\npresent for issuers of securities in which\neach Fund invests, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such\nissuers, and may cause a Fund's investment in\nsuch securities to lose value. 310 Table of\nContents Derivatives Risk. A derivative is a\nfinancial contract the value of which depends\non, or is derived from, the value of an\nunderlying asset, interest rate, or index.\nDerivative transactions typically involve\nleverage and may have significant volatility.\nIt is possible that a derivative transaction\nwill result in a loss greater than the\nprincipal amount invested, and a Fund may not\nbe able to close out a derivative transaction\nat a favorable time or price. Risks associated\nwith derivative instruments include potential\nchanges in value in response to interest rate\nchanges or other market developments or as a\nresult of the counterparty's credit quality;\nthe potential for the derivative transaction\nnot to have the effect the Adviser anticipated\nor a different or less favorable effect than\nthe Adviser anticipated; the failure of the\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction to\nperform its obligations under the transaction\nor to settle a trade; possible mispricing or\nimproper valuation of the derivative\ninstrument; imperfect correlation in the value\nof a derivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that a\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including without\nlimitation absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to a\nFund due to losses on the transaction and an\nincrease in volatility; the potential for the\nderivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. Index\nConstruction Risk . A security included in an\nIndex may not exhibit the characteristic or\nprovide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently a Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that\ncharacteristic or exposure. Index Licensing\nRisk . It is possible that the license under\nwhich the Adviser or a Fund is permitted to\nreplicate or otherwise use an Index will be\nterminated or may be disputed, impaired or\ncease to remain in effect. In such a case, the\nAdviser may be required to replace the\nrelevant Index with another index which it\nconsiders to be appropriate in light of the\ninvestment strategy of a Fund. The use of any\nsuch substitute index may have an adverse\nimpact on a Fund's performance. In the event\nthat the Adviser is unable to identify a\nsuitable replacement for the relevant Index,\nit may determine to terminate a Fund.\nLeveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,\nreverse repurchase agreements, certain\nderivatives transactions, securities lending\ntransactions and other investment transactions\nsuch as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or\nforward commitment transactions may create\ninvestment leverage. If a Fund engages in\ntransactions that have a leveraging effect on\nthe Fund's investment portfolio, the value of\nthe Fund will be potentially more volatile and\nall other risks will tend to be compounded.\nThis is because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than a Fund would otherwise have and\nso magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses to a Fund. Certain\nderivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause a\nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to\nmeet asset segregation or coverage\nrequirements. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk\nis the risk that a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of securities or close out derivatives\ntransactions readily at a favorable time or\nprices (or at all) or at prices approximating\nthose at which a Fund currently values them.\nFor example, certain investments may be\nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade\nin the over-the-counter market or in limited\nvolume, or may not have an active trading\nmarket. Illiquid securities may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for a Fund to value illiquid\nsecurities accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. Disposal of illiquid\nsecurities may entail registration expenses\nand other transaction costs that are higher\nthan those for liquid securities. A Fund may\nseek to borrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of\nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing\nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund.\nMoney Market Risk . An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not a deposit of any bank and\nis not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or\nany other government agency. Certain money\nmarket funds seek to preserve the value of\ntheir shares at $1.00 per share, although\nthere can be no assurance that they will do\nso, and it is possible to lose money by\ninvesting in such a money market fund. A major\nor unexpected change in interest rates or a\ndecline in the 311 Table of Contents credit\nquality of an issuer or entity providing\ncredit support, an inactive trading market for\nmoney market instruments, or adverse market,\neconomic, industry, political, regulatory,\ngeopolitical, and other conditions could cause\nthe share price of such a money market fund to\nfall below $1.00. It is possible that such a\nmoney market fund will issue and redeem shares\nat $1.00 per share at times when the fair\nvalue of the money market fund's portfolio per\nshare is more or less than $1.00. None of\nState Street Corporation, State Street, State\nStreet Global Advisors (\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or\ntheir affiliates (\u201cState Street Entities\u201d)\nguarantee the value of an investment in a\nmoney market fund at $1.00 per share.\nInvestors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market\nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV\nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the\nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or\nless than their original purchase price.\nRecent changes in the regulation of money\nmarket funds may affect the operations and\nstructures of money market funds. A money\nmarket fund may be permitted or required to\nimpose redemption fees or to impose\nlimitations on redemptions during periods of\nhigh illiquidity in the markets for the\ninvestments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . A Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to a Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nhave the effect of reducing a Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. A Fund may engage in frequent\ntrading of its portfolio securities in\nconnection with Index rebalancing. Frequent\ntrading may cause a Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent trading. Securities\nLending Risk. Each Fund may lend portfolio\nsecurities in an amount not to exceed 40% of\nthe value of its net assets. For these\npurposes, net assets shall exclude the value\nof all assets received as collateral for the\nloan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by a\nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a\nloan transaction, as compensation for lending\nits securities, a Fund will receive a portion\nof the dividends or interest accrued on the\nsecurities held as collateral or, in the case\nof cash collateral, a portion of the income\nfrom the investment of such cash. In addition,\na Fund will receive the amount of all\ndividends, interest and other distributions on\nthe loaned securities. However, the borrower\nhas the right to vote the loaned securities. A\nFund will call loans to vote proxies if a\nmaterial issue affecting the investment is to\nbe voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities, and may involve expenses to\na Fund. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. Should the borrower of the securities\nfail financially, a Fund may experience delays\nin recovering the securities or exercising its\nrights in the collateral. Loans are made only\nto borrowers that are deemed by the securities\nlending agent to be of good financial\nstanding. In a loan transaction, a Fund will\nalso bear the risk of any decline in value of\nsecurities provided as collateral or acquired\nwith cash collateral. Each Fund will attempt\nto minimize this risk by limiting the\ninvestment of cash collateral to high quality\ninstruments of short maturity either directly\non behalf of the lending Fund or through one\nor more joint accounts or funds, which may\ninclude those managed by the Adviser. To the\nextent the collateral provided or investments\nmade with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in an Index, such\ncollateral or investments may have a greater\nrisk of loss than the securities included in\nthe Index. In addition, a Fund will be subject\nto the risk that any income generated by\nlending its securities or reinvesting cash\ncollateral is lower than any fees the Fund has\nagreed to pay a borrower. The Adviser will\ntake into account the tax impact to\nshareholders of substitute payments for\ndividends when overseeing a Fund's securities\nlending activity. Trading Issues . Although\nFund Shares are listed for trading on the\nExchange and may be listed or traded on U.S.\nand non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the\nExchange, there can be no assurance that an\nactive trading market for such Fund Shares\nwill develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange may be halted due to\nmarket conditions or for reasons that, in the\nview of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange is subject to\ntrading halts caused by extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit\nbreaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock\nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While each Fund expects that the\nability of Authorized Participants to create\nand redeem Fund Shares at net 312 Table of\nContents asset value should be effective in\nreducing any such volatility, there is no\nguarantee that it will eliminate the\nvolatility associated with such short sales.\nThere can be no assurance that the\nrequirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of a Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange.\n\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to each Fund and,\nsubject to the oversight of the Board, is\nresponsible for the investment management of\neach Fund. The Adviser provides an investment\nmanagement program for each Fund and manages\nthe investment of each Fund's assets. The\nAdviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State\nStreet Global Advisors, Inc., which itself is\na wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation. The Adviser is registered with\nthe SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940, as amended. The Adviser and certain\nother affiliates of State Street Corporation\nmake up SSGA. SSGA is one of the world's\nlargest institutional money managers and the\ninvestment management arm of State Street\nCorporation.

The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The\nExchange may close early on the business day\nbefore certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules\nare subject to change without notice. If you\nbuy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you will pay the secondary market\nprice for Fund Shares. In addition, you may\nincur customary brokerage commissions and\ncharges and may pay some or all of the spread\nbetween the bid and the offered price in the\nsecondary market on each leg of a round trip\n(purchase and sale) transaction. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares will fluctuate\ncontinuously throughout trading hours based on\nmarket supply and demand rather than the\nrelevant Fund's net asset value, which is\ncalculated at the end of each business day.\nFund Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nprices that may be above ( i.e., at a premium)\nor below ( i.e., at a discount), to varying\ndegrees, the daily net asset value of Fund\nShares. The trading prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the relevant Fund's\nnet asset value during periods of market\nvolatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares\ncan be issued and redeemed daily in Creation\nUnits, the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts and premiums to net asset value\nshould not be sustained over long periods. The\nExchange will disseminate, every fifteen\nseconds during the regular trading day, an\nindicative optimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d)\nrelating to each Fund. The IOPV calculations\nare estimates of the value of each Fund's net\nasset value per Fund Share. Premiums and\ndiscounts between the IOPV and the market\nprice may occur. This should not be viewed as\na \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset value\nper Fund Share. The IOPV is based on the\ncurrent market value of the published basket\nof portfolio securities and/or cash required\nto be deposited in exchange for a Creation\nUnit and does not necessarily reflect the\nprecise composition of a Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. The IOPV price is\nbased on quotes and closing prices from the\nsecurities' local market converted into U.S.\ndollars at the current currency rates and may\nnot reflect events that occur subsequent to\nthe local market's close. Therefore, the IOPV\nmay not reflect the best possible valuation of\na Fund's current portfolio. Neither the Funds\nnor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are\ninvolved in, or responsible for, the\ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and\nmake no warranty as to their accuracy. The\nFunds do not impose any restrictions on the\nfrequency of purchases and redemptions;\nhowever, the Funds reserve the right to reject\nor limit purchases at any time as described in\nthe SAI. When considering that no restriction\nor policy was necessary, the Board evaluated\nthe risks posed by market timing activities,\nsuch as whether frequent purchases and\nredemptions would interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of a Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause a Fund\nto experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional\nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and\nredeemed only in large quantities of shares\nknown as Creation Units, available only from a\nFund directly, and that most trading in a Fund\noccurs on the Exchange at prevailing market\nprices and does not involve the Fund directly.\nGiven this structure, the Board determined\nthat it is unlikely that (a) market timing\nwould be attempted by a Fund's shareholders or\n(b) any attempts to market time a Fund by\nshareholders would result in negative impact\nto the Fund or its shareholders. 323 Table of\nContents Distributions Dividends and Capital\nGains. As a Fund shareholder, you are entitled\nto your share of the applicable Fund's income\nand net realized gains on its investments.\nEach Fund pays out substantially all of its\nnet earnings to its shareholders as\n\u201cdistributions.\u201d Each Fund may earn income\ndividends from stocks, interest from debt\nsecurities and, if participating, securities\nlending income. These amounts, net of expenses\nand taxes (if applicable), are passed along to\nFund shareholders as \u201cincome dividend\ndistributions.\u201d Each Fund will generally\nrealize short-term capital gains or losses\nwhenever it sells or exchanges assets held for\none year or less. Net short-term capital gains\nwill generally be treated as ordinary income\nwhen distributed to shareholders. Each Fund\nwill generally realize long-term capital gains\nor losses whenever it sells or exchanges\nassets held for more than one year. Net\ncapital gains (the excess of a Fund's net\nlong-term capital gains over its net short-\nterm capital losses) are distributed to\nshareholders as \u201ccapital gain distributions.\u201d\nIncome dividend distributions, if any, for the\nFunds (except the SPDR MSCI USA\nStrategicFactors SMETF and SPDR Wells Fargo\nPreferred Stock ETF) are generally distributed\nto shareholders quarterly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Income\ndividend distributions, if any, for the SPDR\nMSCI USA StrategicFactors SMETF and SPDR Wells\nFargo Preferred Stock ETF are generally\ndistributed to shareholders semi-annually and\nmonthly, respectively, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Net\ncapital gains for each Fund are distributed at\nleast annually. Dividends may be declared and\npaid more frequently or at any other time to\nimprove Index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Code. For the\nSPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF, SPDR Portfolio S&P\n500 High Dividend ETF, SPDR S&P Dividend ETF,\nSPDR S&P Internet ETF and SPDR Wells Fargo\nPreferred Stock ETF: the Funds intend to\ndistribute at least annually amounts\nrepresenting the full dividend yield net of\nexpenses on the underlying investment\nsecurities as if the Fund owned the underlying\ninvestment securities for the entire dividend\nperiod. As a result, some portion of each\ndistribution may result in a return of\ncapital. You will be notified regarding the\nportion of the distribution which represents a\nreturn of capital. Distributions in cash may\nbe reinvested automatically in additional\nwhole Fund Shares only if the broker through\nwhom you purchased Fund Shares makes such\noption available. Distributions which are\nreinvested will nevertheless be taxable to the\nsame extent as if such distributions had not\nbeen reinvested. Portfolio Holdings Disclosure\nThe Funds' portfolio holdings disclosure\npolicy is described in the SAI. In addition,\nthe identities and quantities of the\nsecurities held by each Fund are disclosed on\nthe Funds' website. Additional Tax Information\nThe following discussion is a summary of some\nimportant U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in a Fund. Your investment in a\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes on Distributions.\nIn general, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in a\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from a\nFund will be taxed as either ordinary income\nor qualified dividend income. Subject to\ncertain limitations, dividends that are\nreported by a Fund as qualified dividend\nincome are taxable to noncorporate\nshareholders at rates of up to 20%. Any\ndistributions of a Fund's net capital gains\nare taxable as long-term capital gain\nregardless of how long you have owned Fund\nShares. Long-term capital gains are generally\ntaxed to noncorporate shareholders at rates of\nup to 20%. Distributions in excess of a Fund's\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits\nare treated as a tax-free return of capital to\nthe extent of your basis in the applicable\nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital\ngain thereafter. In general, dividends may be\nreported by a Fund as qualified dividend\nincome if they are attributable to qualified\ndividend income received by the Fund, which,\nin general, includes dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations and certain foreign\ncorporations ( i.e., certain foreign\ncorporations incorporated in a possession of\nthe United States or in certain countries with\na comprehensive tax treaty with the United\nStates, and certain other foreign corporations\nif the stock with respect to which the\ndividend is paid is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the United\n324 Table of Contents States), provided that\nthe Fund satisfies certain holding period\nrequirements in respect of the stock of such\ncorporations and has not hedged its position\nin the stock in certain ways. A dividend\ngenerally will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income if the dividend is received\nwith respect to any share of stock held by a\nFund for fewer than 61 days during the 121-day\nperiod beginning at the date which is 60 days\nbefore the date on which such share becomes\nex-dividend with respect to such dividend or,\nin the case of certain preferred stock, for\nfewer than 91 days during the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such date. These\nholding period requirements will also apply to\nyour ownership of Fund Shares. Holding periods\nmay be suspended for these purposes for stock\nthat is hedged. Additionally, income derived\nin connection with a Fund's securities lending\nactivities will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income. U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding specified thresholds are subject to\na 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on all or a\nportion of their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d\nwhich includes taxable interest, dividends and\ncertain capital gains (generally including\ncapital gain distributions and capital gains\nrealized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This\n3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of\nthe undistributed net investment income of\ncertain shareholders that are estates and\ntrusts. Certain tax-exempt educational\ninstitutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on\nnet investment income. For these purposes,\ncertain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. If you lend your Fund\nShares pursuant to securities lending\narrangements you may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares are\nheld by the borrower) as qualified dividend\nincome. You should consult your financial\nintermediary or tax advisor to discuss your\nparticular circumstances. Distributions paid\nin January, but declared by a Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year,\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth, may be taxable to you in the calendar\nyear in which they were declared. The Funds\nwill inform you of the amount of your ordinary\nincome dividends, qualified dividend income\nand capital gain distributions shortly after\nthe close of each calendar year. A\ndistribution will reduce a Fund's net asset\nvalue per Fund Share and may be taxable to you\nas ordinary income or capital gain even\nthough, from an investment standpoint, the\ndistribution may constitute a return of\ncapital. Derivatives and Other Complex\nSecurities. A Fund may invest in complex\nsecurities. These investments may be subject\nto numerous special and complex rules. These\nrules could affect whether gains and losses\nrecognized by a Fund are treated as ordinary\nincome or capital gain, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to a Fund and/or defer a\nFund's ability to recognize losses. In turn,\nthese rules may affect the amount, timing or\ncharacter of the income distributed to you by\na Fund. You should consult your personal tax\nadvisor regarding the application of these\nrules. Foreign Currency Transactions. A Fund's\ntransactions in foreign currencies, foreign\ncurrency denominated debt obligations and\ncertain foreign currency options, futures\ncontracts and forward contracts (and similar\ninstruments) may give rise to ordinary income\nor loss to the extent such income or loss\nresults from fluctuations in the value of the\nforeign currency concerned. Foreign Income\nTaxes. Investment income received by a Fund\nfrom sources within foreign countries may be\nsubject to foreign income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The United States has entered into\ntax treaties with many foreign countries which\nmay entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of such\ntaxes or exemption from taxes on such income.\nIt is impossible to determine the effective\nrate of foreign tax for a Fund in advance\nsince the amount of the assets to be invested\nwithin various countries is not known. If more\nthan 50% of the total assets of a Fund at the\nclose of its taxable year consist of certain\nforeign stocks or securities, the Fund may\nelect to \u201cpass through\u201d to you certain foreign\nincome taxes (including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund. If a Fund in which you hold\nFund Shares makes such an election, you will\nbe considered to have received as an\nadditional dividend your share of such foreign\ntaxes, but you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income, or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not so elect, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a deduction for\ncertain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund.\nUnder certain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign taxes paid in\nrespect of a prior year, the value of Fund\nShares could be affected or any foreign tax\ncredits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign\ntaxes for the current year could be reduced.\n325 Table of Contents Real Estate Investments.\nNon-U.S. persons are generally subject to U.S.\ntax on a disposition of a \u201cUnited States real\nproperty interest\u201d (a \u201cUSRPI\u201d). Gain on such a\ndisposition is generally referred to as\n\u201cFIRPTA gain.\u201d The Code provides a look-\nthrough rule for distributions of so-called\nFIRPTA gain by a Fund if certain requirements\nare met. If the look-through rule applies,\ncertain distributions attributable to income\nreceived by a Fund, e.g., from U.S. REITs, may\nbe treated as gain from the disposition of a\nUSRPI, causing distributions to be subject to\nU.S. withholding tax at rates of up to 21%,\nand requiring non-U.S. investors to file\nnonresident U.S. income tax returns. Also,\ngain may be subject to a 30% branch profits\ntax in the hands of a foreign stockholder that\nis treated as a corporation for federal income\ntax purposes. Under certain circumstances,\nShares may qualify as USRPIs, which could\nresult in 15% withholding on certain\ndistributions and gross redemption proceeds\npaid to certain non-U.S. shareholders. For tax\nyears beginning after December 31, 2017 and\nbefore January 1, 2026, a noncorporate\ntaxpayer is generally eligible for a deduction\nof up to 20% of the taxpayer's \u201cqualified REIT\ndividends.\u201d If a Fund receives dividends\n(other than capital gain dividends) in respect\nof REIT shares, the Fund may report its own\ndividends as eligible for the 20% deduction,\nto the extent the Fund's income is derived\nfrom such qualified REIT dividends, as reduced\nby allocable Fund expenses. In order for a\nFund's dividends to be eligible for this\ndeduction when received by a noncorporate\nshareholder, the Fund must meet certain\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe REIT shares on which the Fund received the\neligible dividends, and the noncorporate\nshareholder must meet certain holding period\nrequirements with respect to the Fund Shares.\nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund Shares is generally treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for more than one year and as short-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for one year or less, except that any\ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held\nfor six months or less is treated as long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to such Fund\nShares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of\nCreation Units. A person who exchanges\nsecurities for Creation Units generally will\nrecognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss\nwill be equal to the difference between the\nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time\nand the exchanger's aggregate basis in the\nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for\nthe Creation Units. A person who exchanges\nCreation Units for securities will generally\nrecognize a gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the exchanger's basis in\nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss\nrealized upon an exchange of securities for\nCreation Units cannot be deducted currently\nunder the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on\nthe basis that there has been no significant\nchange in economic position. Persons\nexchanging securities should consult their own\ntax advisor with respect to whether wash sale\nrules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. Under current federal tax laws,\nany capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for\nmore than one year and as a short-term capital\ngain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for one\nyear or less. If you create or redeem Creation\nUnits, you will be sent a confirmation\nstatement showing how many Fund Shares you\npurchased or sold and at what price. The Trust\non behalf of each Fund has the right to reject\nan order for Creation Units if the purchaser\n(or a group of purchasers) would, upon\nobtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80%\nor more of the outstanding shares of the\napplicable Fund and if, pursuant to Section\n351 of the Code, the applicable Fund would\nhave a basis in the securities different from\nthe market value of the securities on the date\nof deposit. The Trust also has the right to\nrequire information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund, the\npurchaser (or group of purchasers) will not\nrecognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If a Fund\nredeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear\nadditional costs and recognize more capital\ngains than it would if it redeems Creation\nUnits in-kind. 326 Table of Contents Certain\nTax-Exempt Investors. A Fund, if investing in\ncertain limited real estate investments and\nother publicly traded partnerships, may be\nrequired to pass through certain \u201cexcess\ninclusion income\u201d and other income as\n\u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d (\u201cUBTI\u201d).\nPrior to investing in a Fund, tax-exempt\ninvestors sensitive to UBTI should consult\ntheir tax advisors regarding this issue and\nIRS pronouncements addressing the treatment of\nsuch income in the hands of such investors.\nInvestments In Certain Foreign Corporations. A\nFund may invest in foreign entities classified\nas passive foreign investment companies or\n\u201cPFICs\u201d or controlled foreign corporations or\n\u201cCFCs\u201d under the Code. PFIC and CFC\ninvestments are subject to complex rules that\nmay under certain circumstances adversely\naffect a Fund. Accordingly, investors should\nconsult their own tax advisors and carefully\nconsider the tax consequences of PFIC and CFC\ninvestments by a Fund before making an\ninvestment in such Fund. Fund dividends\nattributable to dividends received from PFICs\ngenerally will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income. Additional information\npertaining to the potential tax consequences\nto the Funds, and to the shareholders, from\nthe Funds' potential investment in PFICs and\nCFCs can be found in the SAI. Non-U.S.\nInvestors. Ordinary income dividends paid by a\nFund to shareholders who are non-resident\naliens or foreign entities will generally be\nsubject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (other\nthan distributions reported by the Fund as\ninterest-related dividends and short-term\ncapital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty\nrate applies or unless such income is\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, a Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of\nits net income derived from U.S.-source\ninterest, and a Fund may report short-term\ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains\non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a trade or business within the\nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax\nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of a\nFund's shares are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment. Unless certain\nnon-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply\nwith IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding\nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions payable to such\nentities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt\nfrom the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund will be\nrequired in certain cases to withhold (as\n\u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts payable to\nany shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States.\nOther Tax Issues. A Fund may be subject to tax\nin certain states where the Fund does business\n(or is treated as doing business as a result\nof its investments). Furthermore, in those\nstates which have income tax laws, the tax\ntreatment of the Funds and of Fund\nshareholders with respect to distributions by\nthe Funds may differ from federal tax\ntreatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes\nsome of the consequences under current federal\nincome tax law of an investment in the Funds.\nIt is not a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. Consult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax consequences of an\ninvestment in the Funds under all applicable\ntax laws. General Information The Trust was\norganized as a Massachusetts business trust on\nJune 12, 1998. If shareholders of any Fund are\nrequired to vote on any matters, shareholders\nare entitled to one vote for each Fund Share\nthey own. Annual meetings of shareholders will\nnot be held except as required by the 1940 Act\nand other applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization Each\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. 327 Table of Contents For\npurposes of the 1940 Act, Fund Shares are\nissued by the respective series of the Trust\nand the acquisition of Fund Shares by\ninvestment companies is subject to the\nrestrictions of Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940\nAct. The Trust has received exemptive relief\nfrom Section 12(d)(1) to allow registered\ninvestment companies to invest in the Funds\nbeyond the limits set forth in Section\n12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions as set forth in an SEC exemptive\norder issued to the Trust, including that such\ninvestment companies enter into an agreement\nwith the Trust. From time to time, a Fund may\nadvertise yield and total return figures.\nYield is a historical measure of dividend\nincome, and total return is a measure of past\ndividend income (assuming that it has been\nreinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither\nyield nor total return should be used to\npredict the future performance of a Fund.\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel\nto the Trust, including the Funds. Ernst &\nYoung LLP serves as the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and will audit the\nFunds' financial statements annually.\nFinancial Highlights These financial highlight\ntables are intended to help you understand\neach Fund's financial performance for the past\nfive fiscal years or, if shorter, the period\nsince each Fund's inception. Certain\ninformation reflects the performance results\nfor a single Fund Share. The total returns in\nthe table represent the rate that an investor\nwould have earned (or lost) on an investment\nin each Fund (assuming reinvestment of all\ndividends and distributions). This information\nhas been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the\nTrust's independent registered public\naccounting firm, whose report, along with each\nFund's financial highlights and financial\nstatements, is included in the annual report\nto shareholders, which is available upon\nrequest. Any references to Notes in these\nfinancial highlight tables refer to the \u201cNotes\nto Financial Statements\u201d section of each\nFund's financial statements, and the financial\ninformation

Distributions are     \n       assumed, for the purpose of this       \n  (e)  calculation, to be reinvested at net   \n       asset value per share on the           \n       respective payment dates of each       \n       distribution. Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized. Broker commission charges  \n       are not included in this calculation.  \n       If the Adviser had not made a          \n  (f)  contribution during the year ended     \n       June 30, 2016, the total return would  \n       have remained 5.62%.                   \n       Portfolio turnover rate excludes       \n  (g)  securities received or delivered from  \n       in-kind processing of

\n       Per share numbers have been            \n       calculated using average shares        \n  (b)  outstanding, which more appropriately  \n       presents the per share data for the    \n

                       \n       Total return is calculated assuming a  \n       purchase of shares at net asset value  \n       on the first day and a sale at net     \n       asset value on the last day of each    \n       period reported. Distributions are     \n       assumed, for the purpose of this       \n  (d)  calculation, to be reinvested at net   \n       asset value per share on the           \n       respective payment dates of each       \n       distribution. Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized. Broker commission charges  \n       are not included in this calculation.  \n       Portfolio turnover rate excludes       \n  (e)  securities received or delivered from  \n       in-kind processing

payment resulted in an increase   \n       to total return of 0.02% for the       \n       period ended June 30, 2017.            \n  (d)  Amount is less than $0.005 per share.  \n       Total return

period because of the timing of sales  \n       and repurchases of Fund shares in      \n       relation to fluctuating market values  \n       for the Fund.                          \n       Reflects a non-recurring litigation    \n       payment received by the Fund from      \n       State Street Corp., an affiliate,      \n  (c)  which amounted to $0.06 per share      \n       outstanding as of March 20, 2017.      \n       This payment resulted in an increase   \n       to total return of 0.18% for the       \n       period ended June 30, 2017.            \n       Total return is calculated assuming a  \n       purchase of shares at net asset value  \n       on the first day and a sale at net     \n       asset value on the last day of each    \n       period reported. Distributions are     \n       assumed, for the purpose of this       \n  (d)  calculation, to be reinvested at net   \n       asset value per share on the           \n       respective payment dates of each       \n       distribution. Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized.

period because of the timing of sales  \n       and repurchases of Fund shares in      \n       relation to fluctuating market values  \n       for the Fund.                          \n       Total

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 69%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nSSGA Gender Diversity\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of\nU.S. large\ncapitalization\ncompanies that are\n\u201cgender diverse,\u201d\nwhich are defined as\ncompanies that exhibit\ngender diversity in\ntheir senior\nleadership positions\n(as set forth below).\nThe Index constituents\nare a subset of the\nlargest 1,000 U.S.\nstocks based on market\ncapitalization listed\non a U.S. national\nsecurities exchange\nthat have a trailing\nsix-month average\ndaily trading volume\nof at least 250,000\nshares as of the Index\nrebalance\ndetermination date.\nThis subset serves as\nthe initial universe\nof eligible securities\nfor the Index (the\n\u201cIndex Universe\u201d),\nprovided that any\ncompany whose market\ncapitalization\nrepresents greater\nthan 10% of its\nrespective sector's\ntotal market\ncapitalization is not\neligible for inclusion\nin the Index to avoid\noverconcentration in\nany single issuer\nrelative to its\nrespective sector's\nweighting in the\nIndex. In constructing\nthe Index, the Index\nUniverse is ranked by\ngender diversity\nwithin each sector\naccording to ratio-\nbased criteria, as\ndetermined by an\nanalysis by an\nindependent third\nparty of information\nincluded in a\ncompany's regulatory\nfilings, press\nreleases and corporate\nwebsite (\u201ccompany\ncommunications\u201d).\nCompanies are ranked\nwithin each sector by\nthe following three\ngender diversity\nratio-based criteria:\n(i) ratio of female\nexecutives and female\nmembers of the board\nof directors to all\nexecutives and members\nof the board of\ndirectors; (ii) ratio\nof female executives\nto all executives;\n(iii) ratio of female\nexecutives excluding\nexecutives who are\nmembers of the board\nof directors to all\nexecutives excluding\nexecutives who are\nmembers of the board\nof directors.\n\u201cExecutives\u201d comprise\neach employee\ndisclosed in company\ncommunications that\nholds the position of\nVice President and\nabove in the\norganizational\nstructure of such\ncompany, except that\n\u201cexecutives\u201d of\nfinancial sector\ncompanies comprise\neach employee\ndisclosed in company\ncommunications that\nholds the position of\nManaging Director or\nabove in the\norganizational\nstructure of such\ncompany. Executives\nand members of the\nboard of directors of\na company collectively\nconstitute the \u201csenior\nleadership\u201d of such\ncompany. For each\nratio-based criteria,\nthe highest ranked\ncompanies within each\nsector whose combined\nsector market\ncapitalization equals\n10%, including the\nfirst company that\nbrings the combined\nsector market\ncapitalization above\n10% (such companies,\nthe \u201cRank Qualifying\nCompanies\u201d), are\neligible for inclusion\nin the Index. For each\nratio-based criteria,\na Rank Qualifying\nCompany included in\nthe Index that, as of\nthe next annual Index\nrebalance\ndetermination date, is\nno longer a Rank\nQualifying Company\nwill remain eligible\nfor inclusion in the\nIndex for one\nadditional rebalance\nperiod so long as the\ncompany's qualifying\nratio has not\ndecreased. The Index\ncomprises companies\nthat are eligible for\ninclusion based on the\nratio-based criteria\nand which have at\nleast one female in\none of the following\npositions in the\ncompany: Chief\nExecutive Officer,\nchairperson, or member\nof the board of\ndirectors, as of the\nmost recent annual\nIndex rebalance\ndetermination date. At\nthe annual Index\nrebalance\ndetermination date,\nconstituents are first\nweighted by free float\nmarket capitalization.\nConstituent weightings\nare then adjusted so\nthat the aggregate\nsector weights in the\nIndex are the same as\nthe aggregate sector\nweights in the Index\nUniverse and so the\nmaximum individual\nsecurity weight in the\nIndex is capped at 5%.\nThe Index rebalances\nannually on July 15 or\non the next business\nday following July 15\nif July 15 is not a\nbusiness day. As of\nJuly 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, the Index\ncomprised 167\nsecurities. The Index\nwas created and is\nsponsored by State\nStreet Global Advisors\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d\nor \u201cSSGA\u201d), an\naffiliate of the Fund\nand of SSGA FM, the\nFund's Adviser. The\nIndex Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. 2\nTable of Contents\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Gender Diversity\nRisk: The returns on a\nportfolio of\nsecurities that\nexcludes companies\nthat are not gender\ndiverse may trail the\nreturns on a portfolio\nof securities that\nincludes companies\nthat are not gender\ndiverse. Investing\nonly in a portfolio of\nsecurities that are\ngender diverse may\naffect the Fund's\nexposure to certain\ntypes of investments\nand may adversely\nimpact the Fund's\nperformance depending\non whether such\ninvestments are in or\nout of favor in the\nmarket. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness , product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations\n\n3 Table of Contents\n\non investments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                              \n                   OneYear  Since             \n                            Inception(03/07\u2026  \n  Return Before    23.77%   12.75%            \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on         23.18%   10.91%            \n  Distributions                               \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributions    14.45%   9.42%             \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  SSGA Gender                                 \n  Diversity Index                             \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction        23.98%   12.94%            \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for    31.49%   15.67%            \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                      4                       \nTable of Contents Portfolio Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund. The Adviser\nand certain of its affiliates intend to make\ncontributions to a charitable organization,\nwhich is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(the \u201cCode\u201d), developed to provide financial\nsupport to third party charitable\norganizations which seek to enhance gender\nequity through educational efforts. Charitable\ncontributions from the Adviser and certain of\nits affiliates will be benchmarked to the\nassets under management of the Fund. The\ncharitable organization will seek to make\ndonations to identified charitable\norganizations that support continuing\neducational efforts designed to mitigate\ngender inequality in corporate America, and\nwill aim to engage with other organizations in\nan effort to increase the amount of\nphilanthropic dollars available for such\ninitiatives. The charitable organization will\nnot participate in, or have any influence on\nthe day-to-day operations of, the Fund or the\nAdviser's management of the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Lynn Blake, Melissa Kapitulik and\nAmy Cheng. Lynn Blake, CFA, is an Executive\nVice President of the Adviser and Chief\nInvestment Officer of the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n1987. Melissa Kapitulik is a Vice President of\nthe Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in\nthe Global Equity Beta Solutions Group. She\njoined the Adviser in 2006. Amy Cheng is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n2000. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n5 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeSSGA US Large Cap Low Volatility Index\nETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR SSGA US Large Cap Low Volatility   \n  Index                                       \n  ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide           \n  investment                                  \n  results that, before fees and expenses,     \n  correspond                                  \n  generally to the total return performance   \n  of a                                        \n  large cap, low volatility index.            \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 25% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the SSGA\nUS Large Cap Low\nVolatility Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. 6 Table of\nContents The Index is\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of the\nstocks of U.S. large\ncapitalization\ncompanies that exhibit\nlow volatility.\nVolatility is a\nstatistical measurement\nof the magnitude of\nmovements in a stock's\nprice over time. In\nselectingconstituents\nfrom the Index Universe\n(defined herein), the\nIndex utilizes a\nproprietary rules-based\nprocess that seeks to\nincrease exposure to\nstocks in the Index\nUniverse that exhibit\nlow volatility. The\ninitial universe of\nsecurities eligible for\ninclusion in the Index\n(the \u201cIndex Universe\u201d)\nis comprised of the\nlargest 1,000 U.S.\nstocks, based on market\ncapitalization, listed\non a U.S. national\nsecurities exchange\nthat have trailing six-\nmonth average daily\ntrading volumes of at\nleast 250,000 shares\nand free float factors\n(percentage of common\nshares outstanding\nreadily available in\nthe market) greater\nthan 50% as of the\nIndex rebalance\ndetermination date.\nEligible stocks are\nassigned to a sector\nand ranked within each\nsector according to\ntheir volatility. A\nstock's volatility is\nmeasured by the\nstandard deviation of\nmonthly total returns\nto that stock's price\nover the trailing 5\nyears as of the Index\nrebalance determination\ndate. For stocks with\nless than 5 years of\nmonthly returns,\nvolatility is measured\nby available monthly\nreturns if the stock\nhas at least 2.5 years\nof monthly returns or\nby the average\nvolatility of stocks in\nthe same sector in the\nInvestment Universe if\nthe stock has fewer\nthan 2.5 years of\nmonthly returns. For\neach sector, stocks\nwith the lowest\nvolatility whose\ncombined free float\nsector market\ncapitalization equals\n30% are selected for\ninclusion in the Index,\nincluding the first\nstock that brings the\ncombined sector market\ncapitalization above\n30%. The Index weights\nconstituent securities\nsuch that securities\nwith the lowest\nvolatility receive the\nhighest weights in the\nIndex, subject to\nliquidity constraints\nlimiting a\nconstituent's weighting\nin the Index to 5% and\nto 20 times the\nconstituent's weight\nwithin the Index\nUniverse. The Index\nrebalance determination\ndate is 10 business\ndays prior to the last\nbusiness day of March.\nIndex rebalancings are\neffective after the\nclose of the last\nbusiness day of March.\nAs of July 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial and\ntechnology sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 131\nsecurities in the\nIndex.\n\nThe Index was created\nand is sponsored by\nState Street Global\nAdvisors (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d or \u201cSSGA\u201d),\nan affiliate of the\nFund and of SSGA FM,\nthe Fund's Adviser. The\nIndex Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLow Volatility Risk:\nAlthough subject to the\nrisks of common stocks,\nlow volatility stocks\nare seen as having a\nlower risk profile than\nthe overall markets.\nHowever, a portfolio\ncomprised of low\nvolatility stocks may\nnot produce investment\nexposure that has lower\nvariability to changes\nin such stocks' price\nlevels. Low volatility\nstocks are likely to\nunderperform the\nbroader market during\nperiods of rapidly\nrising stock prices.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\n7 Table of Contents\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. 8\nTable of Contents Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may hold\na smaller number of\nportfolio securities\nthan many other funds.\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively\nsmall number of\nissuers, a decline in\nthe market value of a\nparticular security\nheld by the Fund may\naffect its value more\nthan if it invested in\na larger number of\nissuers. The value of\nFund Shares may be more\nvolatile than the\nvalues of shares of\nmore diversified funds.\nThe Fund may become\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of changes in\nthe composition of the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\nFund Performance\n\nThe following bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective December 13, 2016 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Russell 1000\nLow Volatility Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark\nIndex\u201d) to the SSGA US Large Cap Low\nVolatility Index, consistent with a change in\nthe Fund's principal investment strategy to\ntrack the performance of the current index.\nPerformance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark\nIndex Change Date is therefore based on the\nFund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index.\n             9 Table of Contents              \n                                              \n             OneYear  FiveYears  Since        \n                                 Inception(\u2026  \n  Return                                      \n  Before     31.06%   12.07%     13.77%       \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return                                      \n  After      30.31%   11.09%     12.50%       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribu\u2026                                   \n  Return                                      \n  After                                       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribu\u2026  18.66%   9.23%      10.67%       \n  and Sale                                    \n  of Fund                                     \n  Shares                                      \n  1          31.30%   12.26%     13.99%       \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects                                   \n  no         31.49%   11.70%     14.03%       \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses                                    \n  or taxes)                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Returns shown are reflective of the    \n       Index for periods beginning on the     \n  (1)  Benchmark Index Change Date and the    \n       Previous Benchmark Index for periods   \n       prior to the Benchmark Index Change    \n       Date.                                  \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Juan Acevedo. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Juan Acevedo is\na Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2000. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 32%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nSSGA US Small Cap Low\nVolatility Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of\nderivativeinstrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. 11 Table\nof Contents The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\nstocks of U.S. small\ncapitalization\ncompanies that exhibit\nlow volatility.\nVolatility is a\nstatistical\nmeasurement of the\nmagnitude of movements\nin a stock's price\nover time. Inselecting\nconstituents from the\nIndex Universe\n(defined herein), the\nIndex utilizes a\nproprietary rules-\nbased process that\nseeks to increase\nexposure to stocks in\nthe Index Universe\nthat exhibit low\nvolatility. The\ninitial universe of\nsecurities eligible\nfor inclusion in the\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\nUniverse\u201d) is\ncomprised of the 2,000\nU.S. stocks listed on\na U.S. national\nsecurities exchange\nwhose market\ncapitalizations rank\nfrom 1,001 to 3,000\nthat have trailing\nsix-month average\ndaily trading volumes\nof at least 250,000\nshares and free float\nfactors (percentage of\ncommon shares\noutstanding readily\navailable in the\nmarket) greater than\n50% as of the Index\nrebalance\ndetermination date.\nEligible stocks are\nassigned to a sector\nand ranked within each\nsector according to\ntheir volatility. A\nstock's volatility is\nmeasured by the\nstandard deviation of\nmonthly total returns\nto that stock's price\nover the trailing 5\nyears as of the Index\nrebalance\ndetermination date.\nFor stocks with less\nthan 5 years of\nmonthly returns,\nvolatility is measured\nby available monthly\nreturns if the stock\nhas at least 2.5 years\nof monthly returns or\nby the average\nvolatility of stocks\nin the same sector in\nthe Investment\nUniverse if the stock\nhas fewer than 2.5\nyears of monthly\nreturns. For each\nsector, stocks with\nthe lowest volatility\nwhose combined free\nfloat sector market\ncapitalization equals\n30% are selected for\ninclusion in the\nIndex, including the\nfirst stock that\nbrings the combined\nsector market\ncapitalization above\n30%. The Index weights\nconstituent securities\nsuch that securities\nwith the lowest\nvolatility receive the\nhighest weights in the\nIndex, subject to\nliquidity constraints\nlimiting a\nconstituent's\nweighting in the Index\nto 5% and to 20 times\nthe constituent's\nweight within the\nIndex Universe. The\nIndex rebalance\ndetermination date is\n10 business days prior\nto the last business\nday of March. Index\nrebalancings are\neffective after the\nclose of the last\nbusiness day of March.\nAs of July 31, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 401\nsecurities in the\nIndex.\n\nThe Index was created\nand is sponsored by\nState Street Global\nAdvisors (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d or \u201cSSGA\u201d),\nan affiliate of the\nFund and of SSGA FM,\nthe Fund's Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Low\nVolatility Risk:\nAlthough subject to\nthe risks of common\nstocks, low volatility\nstocks are seen as\nhaving a lower risk\nprofile than the\noverall markets.\nHowever, a portfolio\ncomprised of low\nvolatility stocks may\nnot produce investment\nexposure that has\nlower variability to\nchanges in such\nstocks' price levels.\nLow volatility stocks\nare likely to\nunderperform the\nbroader market during\nperiods of rapidly\nrising stock prices.\n12 Table of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations 13\nTable of Contents on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\n\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective December 13, 2016 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Russell 2000\nLow Volatility Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark\nIndex\u201d) to the SSGA US Small Cap Low\nVolatility Index, consistent with a change in\nthe Fund's principal investment strategy to\ntrack the performance of the current index.\nPerformance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark\nIndex Change Date is therefore based on the\nFund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index. 1 4 Table of\nContents\n                                              \n             OneYear  FiveYears  Since        \n                                 Inception2\u2026  \n  Return                                      \n  Before     23.86%   9.44%      11.91%       \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return                                      \n  After      22.82%   7.99%      10.45%       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribu\u2026                                   \n  Return                                      \n  After                                       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribu\u2026  14.40%   6.86%      9.00%        \n  and Sale                                    \n  of                                          \n  Fund                                        \n  Shares                                      \n  1          24.07%   9.44%      11.96%       \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects                                   \n  no         31.49%   11.70%     14.03%       \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses                                    \n  or taxes)                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Returns shown are reflective of the    \n       Index for periods beginning on the     \n  (1)  Benchmark Index Change Date and the    \n       Previous Benchmark Index for periods   \n       prior to the Benchmark Index Change    \n       Date.                                  \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.\n\nPortfolio Managers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Michael Feehily, Karl Schneider\nand John Law. Michael Feehily, CFA, is a\nSenior Managing Director of the Adviser and\nthe Head of Global Equity Beta Solutions in\nthe Americas. He worked at the Adviser from\n1997 to 2006 and rejoined in 2010. Karl\nSchneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the\nAdviser and Deputy Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He joined the\nAdviser in 1997. John Law, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2016. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n15 Table of Contents Additional Strategies\nInformation Principal Strategies General .\nPlease see each Fund's \u201cThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund\nSummaries\u201d above for a complete discussion of\neach Fund's principal investment strategies. A\nFund may invest in various types of securities\nand engage in various investment techniques\nwhich are not the principal focus of the Fund\nand therefore are not described in this\nProspectus. These securities, techniques and\npractices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain\nfree of charge by contacting shareholder\nservices (see the back cover of this\nProspectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of\neach Fund's Index as closely as possible\n(i.e., obtain a high degree of correlation\nwith the Index). A number of factors may\naffect a Fund's ability to achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with its Index, and\nthere can be no guarantee that a Fund will\nachieve a high degree of correlation. For\nexample, a Fund may not be able to achieve a\nhigh degree of correlation with its Index when\nthere are practical difficulties or\nsubstantial costs involved in compiling a\nportfolio of securities to follow the Index,\nwhen a security in the Index becomes\ntemporarily illiquid, unavailable or less\nliquid, or legal restrictions exist that\nprohibit the Fund from investing in a security\nin the Index. The Adviser will utilize a\nsampling strategy in managing the Funds.\nSampling means that the Adviser uses\nquantitative analysis to select securities,\nincluding securities in the Index, outside of\nthe Index and derivatives that have a similar\ninvestment profile as the relevant Index in\nterms of key risk factors, performance\nattributes and other economic characteristics.\nThese include industry weightings, market\ncapitalization, and other financial\ncharacteristics of securities. The quantity of\nholdings in a Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nIn addition, from time to time, securities are\nadded to or removed from each Index. The\nAdviser may sell securities that are\nrepresented in an Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in an\nIndex, in anticipation of their removal from\nor addition to an Index. Further, the Adviser\nmay choose to overweight securities in an\nIndex, purchase or sell securities not in an\nIndex, or utilize various combinations of\nother available techniques, in seeking to\ntrack an Index. The Board of Trustees of the\nTrust (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change a Fund's\ninvestment strategy, Index and other policies\nwithout shareholder approval, except as\notherwise indicated in this Prospectus or in\nthe SAI. The Board may also change a Fund's\ninvestment objective without shareholder\napproval. Non-Principal Strategies Certain\nOther Investments . Each Fund may invest in\nstructured notes (notes on which the amount of\nprincipal repayment and interest payments are\nbased on the movement of one or more specified\nfactors such as the movement of a particular\nsecurity or index), swaps, options and futures\ncontracts. Swaps, options and futures\ncontracts and structured notes may be used by\na Fund in seeking performance that corresponds\nto its Index and in managing cash flows.\nTemporary Defensive Positions . In certain\nsituations or market conditions, a Fund may\ntemporarily depart from its normal investment\npolicies and strategies, provided that the\nalternative is consistent with the Fund's\ninvestment objective and is in the best\ninterest of the Fund. For example, a Fund may\nmake larger than normal investments in\nderivatives to maintain exposure to its Index\nif it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . Each\nFund may borrow money from a bank as permitted\nby the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing\nstatute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund, but only for\ntemporary or emergency purposes. Each Fund may\nalso invest in reverse repurchase agreements,\nwhich are considered borrowings under the 1940\nAct. Although the 1940 Act presently allows a\nFund to borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets)\nin an amount up to 33 1/ 3% of its total\nassets (not including temporary borrowings not\nin excess of 5% of its total assets), and\nthere is no percentage limit on Fund assets\nthat can be used in connection with reverse\nrepurchase agreements, under normal\ncircumstances any borrowings by a Fund will\nnot exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. 1 6\nTable of Contents\n\nLending of Securities . Each Fund may lend its\nportfolio securities in an amount not to\nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets via\na securities lending program through its\nsecurities lending agent, State Street Bank\nand Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d or the\n\u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers, dealers and\nother financial institutions desiring to\nborrow securities to complete transactions and\nfor other purposes. A securities lending\nprogram allows a Fund to receive a portion of\nthe income generated by lending its securities\nand investing the respective collateral. A\nFund will receive collateral for each loaned\nsecurity which is at least equal to the market\nvalue of that security, marked to market each\ntrading day. In the securities lending\nprogram, the borrower generally has the right\nto vote the loaned securities; however, a Fund\nmay call loans to vote proxies if a material\nissue affecting the Fund's economic interest\nin the investment is to be voted upon.\nSecurity loans may be terminated at any time\nby a Fund.\nAdditional Risk Information The following     \nsection provides information regarding the    \nprincipal risks identified under \u201cPrincipal   \nRisks of Investing in the Fund\u201d in each Fund  \nSummary along with additional risk            \ninformation.

A Fund will be subject to\ncredit risk with respect to the counterparties\nwith which the Fund enters into derivatives\ncontracts and other transactions such as\nrepurchase agreements or reverse repurchase\nagreements. A Fund's ability to profit from\nthese types of investments and transactions\nwill depend on the willingness and ability of\nits counterparty to perform its obligations.\nIf a counterparty fails to meet its\ncontractual obligations, a Fund may be unable\nto terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. A Fund may experience significant\ndelays in obtaining any recovery in an\ninsolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any\ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in\nsuch circumstances. If a Fund holds collateral\nposted by its counterparty, it may be delayed\nor prevented from realizing on the collateral\nin the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding relating to the counterparty. Under\napplicable law or contractual provisions,\nincluding if a Fund enters into an investment\nor transaction with a financial institution\nand such financial institution (or an\naffiliate of the financial institution)\nexperiences financial difficulties, then the\nFund may in certain situations be prevented or\ndelayed from exercising its rights to\nterminate the investment or transaction, or to\nrealize on any collateral and may result in\nthe suspension of payment and delivery\nobligations of the parties under such\ninvestment or transactions or in another\ninstitution being substituted for that\nfinancial institution without the consent of\nthe Fund. Further, a Fund may be subject to\n\u201cbail-in\u201d risk under applicable law whereby,\nif required by the financial institution's\nauthority, the financial institution's\nliabilities could be written down, eliminated\nor converted into equity or an alternative\ninstrument of ownership. A bail-in of a\nfinancial institution may result in a\nreduction in value of some or all of its\nsecurities and, if a Fund holds such\nsecurities or has entered into a transaction\nwith such a financial security when a bail-in\noccurs, such Fund may also be similarly\nimpacted. Derivatives Risk. A derivative is a\nfinancial contract the value of which depends\non, or is derived from, the value of an\nunderlying asset, interest rate, or index.\nDerivative transactions typically involve\nleverage and may have significant volatility.\nIt is possible that a derivative transaction\nwill result in a loss greater than the\nprincipal amount invested, and a Fund may not\nbe able to close out a derivative transaction\nat a favorable time or price. Risks associated\nwith derivative instruments include potential\nchanges in value in response to interest rate\nchanges or other market developments or as a\nresult of the counterparty's credit quality;\nthe potential for the derivative transaction\nnot to have the effect the Adviser anticipated\nor a different or less favorable effect than\nthe Adviser anticipated; the failure of the\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction to\nperform its obligations under the transaction\nor to settle a trade; possible mispricing or\nimproper valuation of the derivative\ninstrument; imperfect correlation in the value\nof a derivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that a\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including without\n18 Table of Contents limitation absence of a\nsecondary trading market; the potential for\nreduced returns to a Fund due to losses on the\ntransaction and an increase in volatility; the\npotential for the derivative transaction to\nhave the effect of accelerating the\nrecognition of gain; and legal risks arising\nfrom the documentation relating to the\nderivative transaction. Futures Contract Risk;\nOther Exchange-Traded Derivatives Risk . The\nrisk of loss relating to the use of futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives is potentially unlimited. The\nability to establish and close out positions\nin futures contracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives will be subject to the development\nand maintenance of a liquid secondary market.\nThere is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any\nparticular futures contract or other exchange-\ntraded derivative or at any particular time.\nIn the event no such market exists for a\nparticular derivative, it might not be\npossible to effect closing transactions, and\nthe Fund will be unable to terminate the\nderivative. In using futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives, the Fund\nwill be reliant on the ability of the Adviser\nto predict market and price movements\ncorrectly; the skills needed to use such\nderivatives successfully are different from\nthose needed for traditional portfolio\nmanagement. If the Fund uses futures contracts\nor other exchange-traded derivatives for\nhedging purposes, there is a risk of imperfect\ncorrelation between movements in the prices of\nthe derivatives and movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying the derivatives\nor movements in the prices of the Fund's\ninvestments that are the subject of such\nhedge. The prices of futures and other\nexchange-traded derivatives, for a number of\nreasons, may not correlate perfectly with\nmovements in the securities or index\nunderlying them. For example, participants in\nthe futures markets and in markets for other\nexchange-traded derivatives are subject to\nmargin deposit requirements. Such requirements\nmay cause investors to take actions with\nrespect to their derivatives positions that\nthey would not otherwise take. The margin\nrequirements in the derivatives markets may be\nless onerous than margin requirements in the\nsecurities markets in general, and as a result\nthose markets may attract more speculators\nthan the securities markets do. Increased\nparticipation by speculators in those markets\nmay cause temporary price distortions. Due to\nthe possibility of price distortion, even a\ncorrect forecast of general market trends by\nthe Adviser still may not result in a\nsuccessful derivatives activity over a very\nshort time period. The risk of a position in a\nfutures contract or other exchange-traded\nderivative may be very large compared to the\nrelatively low level of margin the Fund is\nrequired to deposit. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its exchange-traded\nderivatives transactions. The Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with\nits transactions in futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives. In the\nevent of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, the\nFund may not be able to recover all (or any)\nof the margin it has posted with the futures\ncommission merchant, or to realize the value\nof any increase in the price of its positions,\nor it may experience a significant delay in\ndoing so. The Fund also may be delayed or\nprevented from recovering margin or other\namounts deposited with a futures commission\nmerchant or futures clearinghouse. The\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the\n\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have\nestablished limits referred to as \u201cspeculative\nposition limits\u201d on the maximum net long or\nnet short positions that any person and\ncertain affiliated entities may hold or\ncontrol in a particular futures contract.\nTrading limits are imposed on the number of\ncontracts that any person may trade on a\nparticular trading day. An exchange may order\nthe liquidation of positions found to be in\nviolation of these limits and it may impose\nsanctions or restrictions. In addition, the\nDodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to establish\nspeculative position limits on certain\ncommodity futures contracts and their\neconomically equivalent futures, options and\nswaps. Regulatory action taken by the CFTC to\nestablish these additional position limits may\nadversely affect the market liquidity of the\nfutures, options and economically equivalent\nderivatives in which the Fund may invest. It\nis possible that, as a result of such limits,\nthe Fund's Adviser will be precluded from\ntaking positions in certain futures contracts\nor over-the-counter derivatives as a result of\npositions held by other clients of the Adviser\nor by the Adviser or its affiliates\nthemselves. Futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives traded on markets\noutside the U.S. are not generally subject to\nthe same level of regulation by the CFTC or\nother U.S. regulatory entities as contracts\ntraded in the U.S., including without\nlimitation as to the execution, delivery, and\nclearing of transactions. U.S. regulators\nneither regulate the activities of a foreign\nexchange, nor have the power to compel\nenforcement of the rules of the foreign\nexchange or the laws of the foreign country in\nquestion. Margin and other payments made by a\nFund may not be afforded the same protections\nas are afforded those payments in the U.S.,\nincluding in connection with the insolvency of\nan executing or clearing broker or a\nclearinghouse or exchange. Certain foreign\nfutures contracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives may be less liquid and more\nvolatile than U.S. contracts. 1 9 Table of\nContents Equity Investing Risk . The market\nprices of equity securities owned by a Fund\nmay go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The value of a security may\ndecline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer, such as\nmanagement performance, financial leverage,\nnon-compliance with regulatory requirements,\nand reduced demand for the issuer's goods or\nservices. The values of equity securities also\nmay decline due to general industry or market\nconditions that are not specifically related\nto a particular company, such as real or\nperceived adverse economic conditions, changes\nin the general outlook for corporate earnings,\nchanges in interest or currency rates, or\nadverse investor sentiment generally. In\naddition, equity markets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause stock prices to fall\nover short or extended periods of time.\nFinancial Sector Risk. Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation which may limit both\nthe amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may\ncause an unusually high degree of volatility\nin the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to\nraise capital (such as the issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or cease operations.\nCredit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses\nassociated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or\npolitical developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage\nfinance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk\n. The net asset value of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate with changes in the market\nvalue of a Fund's securities holdings. The\nmarket prices of Fund Shares will generally\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in a\nFund's net asset value and supply and demand\nof Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be\npredicted whether Fund Shares will trade\nbelow, at or above their net asset value.\nPrice differences may be due, in large part,\nto the fact that supply and demand forces at\nwork in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not\nidentical to, the same forces influencing the\nprices of the securities of an Index trading\nindividually or in the aggregate at any point\nin time. The market prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the net asset value\nof Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares\ncan be created and redeemed in Creation Units\n(unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable discounts\nfrom, and sometimes at premiums to, their net\nasset value), the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to a\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from such Fund's net asset\nvalue. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto the net asset value of Fund Shares or sells\nat a time when the market price is at a\ndiscount to the net asset value of Fund\nShares, then the investor may sustain losses.\nGender Diversity Risk . The returns on a\nportfolio of securities that excludes\ncompanies that are not gender diverse may\ntrail the returns on a portfolio of securities\nthat includes companies that are not gender\ndiverse. Investing only in a portfolio of\nsecurities that are gender diverse may affect\na Fund's exposure to certain types of\ninvestments and may adversely impact a Fund's\nperformance depending on whether such\ninvestments are in or out of favor in the\nmarket. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk\n. Each Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities. Each Fund will seek to replicate\nIndex returns, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. Each Fund generally will buy and will\nnot sell a security included in the Index as\nlong as the security is part of the Index\nregardless of any sudden or material decline\nin value or foreseeable material decline in\nvalue of the security, even though the Adviser\nmay make a different investment decision for\nother actively managed accounts or portfolios\nthat hold the security. As a result, a Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms 2 0\nTable of Contents and by comparison with other\nindices) and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of a Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with\nits methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on a Fund and\nits shareholders. While the Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance of the Index (i.e.,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex), a Fund's return may not match the\nreturn of the Index for a number of reasons.\nFor example, the return on the sample of\nsecurities purchased by a Fund (or the return\non securities not included in the Index) to\nreplicate the performance of the Index may not\ncorrelate precisely with the return of the\nIndex. Each Fund incurs a number of operating\nexpenses not applicable to the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying and selling securities.\nIn addition, a Fund may not be fully invested\nat times, either as a result of cash flows\ninto or out of the Fund or reserves of cash\nheld by the Fund to meet redemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to trackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between a\nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes\nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact a Fund's ability\nto match the return of the Index. The Adviser\nmay apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment\ntechniques to refine or limit the number or\ntypes of issuers included in the Index in\nwhich a Fund may invest. Application of such\nscreens or techniques may result in investment\nperformance below that of the Index and may\nnot produce results expected by the Adviser.\nIndex tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. Pursuant to each\nIndex methodology, a security may be removed\nfrom an Index in the event that it does not\ncomply with the eligibility requirements of\nthe Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced\nto sell securities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the\nIndex components. When there are changes made\nto the component securities of an Index and\nthe corresponding Fund in turn makes similar\nchanges to its portfolio to attempt to\nincrease the correlation between the Fund's\nportfolio and the Index, any transaction costs\nand market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled\nchanges to an Index may expose the\ncorresponding Fund to additional tracking\nerror risk. A Fund may recognize gains as a\nresult of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the corresponding\nIndex. A Fund also may be required to\ndistribute any such gains to its shareholders\nto avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. Large-Capitalization Securities\nRisk. Securities issued by large-\ncapitalization companies may present risks not\npresent in smaller companies. For example,\nlarger companies may be unable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in\nbusiness, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able\nto maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-\nsized companies, especially during strong\neconomic periods. Returns on investments in\nsecurities of large companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of\nsmaller and mid-sized companies. Leveraging\nRisk . Borrowing transactions, reverse\nrepurchase agreements, certain derivatives\ntransactions, securities lending transactions\nand other investment transactions such as\nwhen-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward\ncommitment transactions may create investment\nleverage. If a Fund engages in transactions\nthat have a leveraging effect on the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, the value of the Fund\nwill be potentially more volatile and all\nother risks will tend to be compounded. This\nis because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than a Fund would otherwise have and\nso magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses to a Fund. Certain\nderivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause a\nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to\nmeet asset segregation or coverage\nrequirements. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk\nis the risk that a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of securities or close out derivatives\ntransactions readily at a favorable time or\nprices (or at all) or at prices approximating\nthose at which a Fund currently values them.\nFor example, certain investments may be\nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade\nin the over-the-counter market or in limited\nvolume, or may not have an active trading\nmarket. Illiquid securities may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for a Fund to value illiquid\nsecurities accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular 21 Table of Contents issuer.\nDisposal of illiquid securities may entail\nregistration expenses and other transaction\ncosts that are higher than those for liquid\nsecurities. A Fund may seek to borrow money to\nmeet its obligations (including among other\nthings redemption obligations) if it is unable\nto dispose of illiquid investments, resulting\nin borrowing expenses and possible leveraging\nof the Fund. Low Volatility Risk. Although\nsubject to the risks of common stocks, low\nvolatility stocks are seen as having a lower\nrisk profile than the overall markets.\nHowever, a portfolio comprised of low\nvolatility stocks may not produce investment\nexposure that has lower variability to changes\nin such stocks' price levels. Low volatility\nstocks are likely to underperform the broader\nmarket during periods of rapidly rising stock\nprices. Market Risk . Market prices of\ninvestments held by a Fund will go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. A Fund's\ninvestments are subject to changes in general\neconomic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in\ninvestment in securities markets. Investment\nmarkets can be volatile, and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in\ninterest rates, changes in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in a\nFund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities\nprices. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments. An outbreak of a respiratory\ndisease caused by a novel coronavirus (known\nas COVID-19) first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has resulted in a global\npandemic and major disruptions to economies\nand markets around the world, including the\nUnited States. Financial markets have\nexperienced extreme volatility and severe\nlosses, and trading in many instruments has\nbeen disrupted. Liquidity for many instruments\nhas been greatly reduced for periods of time.\nSome interest rates are very low and in some\ncases yields are negative. Governments and\ncentral banks, including the Federal Reserve\nin the United States, have taken extraordinary\nand unprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.\nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some\ntime. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19,\nand measures taken to mitigate its effects,\ncould result in disruptions to the services\nprovided to a Fund by its service providers.\nNon-Diversification Risk . As a \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d fund, each Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent a Fund invests\nin a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular\nsecurity held by the Fund may affect its value\nmore than if it invested in a larger number of\nissuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more\nvolatile than the values of shares of more\ndiversified funds. A Fund may become\ndiversified for periods of time solely as a\nresult of changes in the composition of the\ncorresponding Index (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Small-Capitalization Securities\nRisk . The securities of small-capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile and may involve\nmore risk than the securities of larger\ncompanies. These companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets or financial resources,\nmay lack the competitive strength of larger\ncompanies, and may depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition, these companies may\nhave been recently organized and may have\nlittle or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of smaller companies may trade less\nfrequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. The prices of these\nsecurities may fluctuate more sharply than\nthose of other securities, and a Fund may\nexperience some difficulty in establishing or\nclosing out positions in these securities at\nprevailing market prices. There may be less\npublicly available information about the\nissuers of these securities or less market\ninterest in these securities than in the case\nof larger companies, both of which can cause\nsignificant price volatility. Some securities\nof smaller issuers may be illiquid or may be\nrestricted as to resale. A Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its positions in such securities\nat any time, or at a favorable price, in order\nto meet a Fund's obligations. Returns on\ninvestments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of larger\ncompanies. Technology Sector Risk . Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major\neffect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies\nand companies that rely heavily on technology\nis particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from\nforeign competitors with lower production\ncosts. Technology companies may 22 Table of\nContents have limited product lines, markets,\nfinancial resources or personnel. Stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology, especially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the overall market.\nTechnology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the\nloss or impairment of which may adversely\naffect profitability. Additionally, companies\nin the technology sector may face dramatic and\noften unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified\npersonnel. Unconstrained Sector Risk . A Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets\nwithin one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to\ntime. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nValuation Risk . Some portfolio holdings,\npotentially a large portion of a Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the\nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a\nportfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. Technological issues or other service\ndisruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause a Fund to value\nits investments incorrectly. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that a Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the\nvalue established for it at any time, and it\nis possible that a Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby a Fund at that time. Non-Principal Risks\nEach risk discussed below is a non-principal\nrisk of a Fund to the extent it is not\nidentified as a principal risk for such Fund\nin the preceding \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION\n- PRINCIPAL RISKS\u201d section. Authorized\nParticipants, Market Makers and Liquidity\nProviders Concentration Risk. A Fund has a\nlimited number of financial institutions that\nmay act as Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d),\nwhich are responsible for the creation and\nredemption activity for a Fund. In addition,\nthere may be a limited number of market makers\nand/or liquidity providers in the marketplace.\nTo the extent either of the following events\noccur, Fund Shares may trade at a material\ndiscount to NAV and possibly face delisting:\n(i) APs exit the business or otherwise become\nunable to process creation and/or redemption\norders and no other APs step forward to\nperform these services, or (ii) market makers\nand/or liquidity providers exit the business\nor significantly reduce their business\nactivities and no other entities step forward\nto perform their functions. Concentration\nRisk. A Fund's assets will generally be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries to the extent that the Fund's\nunderlying Index concentrates in a particular\nindustry or group of industries. When a Fund\nfocuses its investments in a particular\nindustry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting\nissuers in that industry, market, or economic\nsector will have a greater effect on the Fund\nthan if it had not focused its assets in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector, which\nmay increase the volatility of the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a\nFund will be subject to a number of actual or\npotential conflicts of interest. For example,\nthe Adviser or its affiliates may provide\nservices to a Fund, such as securities lending\nagency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer\nagency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for\nwhich the Fund would compensate the Adviser\nand/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest\nin other pooled investment vehicles sponsored,\nmanaged, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of a\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements.\n\n23 Table of Contents The Adviser and its\naffiliates serve as investment adviser to\nother clients and may make investment\ndecisions that may be different from those\nthat will be made by the Adviser on behalf of\nthe Funds. For example, the Adviser may\nprovide asset allocation advice to some\nclients that may include a recommendation to\ninvest in or redeem from particular issuers\nwhile not providing that same recommendation\nto all clients invested in the same or similar\nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to\npurchase (or sell) investments for a Fund and\nto sell (or purchase) the same investment for\naccounts, funds, or structured products for\nwhich it serves as asset manager, or for other\nclients or affiliates. The Adviser and its\naffiliates may invest for clients in various\nsecurities that are senior, pari passuor\njunior to, or have interests different from or\nadverse to, the securities that are owned by a\nFund. The Adviser or its affiliates, in\nconnection with its other business activities,\nmay acquire material nonpublic confidential\ninformation that may restrict the Adviser from\npurchasing securities or selling securities\nfor itself or its clients (including the\nFunds) or otherwise using such information for\nthe benefit of its clients or itself. The\nforegoing does not purport to be a\ncomprehensive list or complete explanation of\nall potential conflicts of interests which may\naffect a Fund. A Fund may encounter\ncircumstances, or enter into transactions, in\nwhich conflicts of interest that are not\nlisted or discussed above may arise. Costs of\nBuying and Selling Shares . Investors buying\nor selling Fund Shares in the secondary market\nwill pay brokerage commissions or other\ncharges imposed by brokers, as determined by\nthat broker. Brokerage commissions are often a\nfixed amount and may be a significant\nproportional cost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell relatively small amounts of Fund\nShares. In addition, secondary market\ninvestors will also incur the cost of the\ndifference between the price that an investor\nis willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d\nprice) and the price at which an investor is\nwilling to sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price).\nThis difference in bid and ask prices is often\nreferred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask\nspread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time\nfor Fund Shares based on trading volume and\nmarket liquidity, and is generally lower if\nFund Shares have more trading volume and\nmarket liquidity and higher if Fund Shares\nhave little trading volume and market\nliquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask\nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,\nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may\nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Counterparty Risk . A Fund\nwill be subject to credit risk with respect to\nthe counterparties with which the Fund enters\ninto derivatives contracts and other\ntransactions such as repurchase agreements or\nreverse repurchase agreements. A Fund's\nability to profit from these types of\ninvestments and transactions will depend on\nthe willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate\nor realize any gain on the investment or\ntransaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund.\nA Fund may experience significant delays in\nobtaining any recovery in an insolvency,\nbankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding\ninvolving its counterparty (including recovery\nof any collateral posted by it) and may obtain\nonly a limited recovery or may obtain no\nrecovery in such circumstances. If a Fund\nholds collateral posted by its counterparty,\nit may be delayed or prevented from realizing\non the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if a Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another institution being\nsubstituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, a\nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the\nfinancial institution's authority, the\nfinancial institution's liabilities could be\nwritten down, eliminated or converted into\nequity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial\ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of its securities and, if a\nFund holds such securities or has entered into\na transaction with such a financial security\nwhen a bail-in occurs, such Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, funds (such as the Funds) and their\nservice providers (including the Adviser) may\nbe prone to operational and information\nsecurity risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. In general,\ncyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects.\nCyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from\naccessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, 24 Table of Contentsand\ncausing operational disruption. Successful\ncyber-attacks against, or security breakdowns\nof, a Fund, the Adviser or a custodian,\ntransfer agent, or other affiliated or third-\nparty service provider may adversely affect a\nFund or its shareholders. For instance, cyber-\nattacks or technical malfunctions may\ninterfere with the processing of shareholder\nor other transactions, affect a Fund's ability\nto calculate its NAV, cause the release of\nprivate shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial\nlosses, reimbursement or other compensation\ncosts, and additional compliance costs. Cyber-\nattacks or technical malfunctions may render\nrecords of Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and\nother data integral to the functioning of a\nFund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete.\nA Fund may also incur substantial costs for\ncybersecurity risk management in order to\nprevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund\nand its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. While the Adviser has\nestablished business continuity plans and\nsystems designed to minimize the risk of\ncyber-attacks through the use of technology,\nprocesses and controls, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, given the evolving\nnature of this threat. Each Fund relies on\nthird-party service providers for many of its\nday-to-day operations, and will be subject to\nthe risk that the protections and protocols\nimplemented by those service providers will be\nineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-\nattack. The Adviser does not control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems put in place\nby third-party service providers, and such\nthird-party service providers may have limited\nindemnification obligations to the Adviser or\nthe Funds. Similar types of cybersecurity\nrisks or technical malfunctions also are\npresent for issuers of securities in which\neach Fund invests, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such\nissuers, and may cause a Fund's investment in\nsuch securities to lose value. Derivatives\nRisk. A derivative is a financial contract the\nvalue of which depends on, or is derived from,\nthe value of an underlying asset, interest\nrate, or index. Derivative transactions\ntypically involve leverage and may have\nsignificant volatility. It is possible that a\nderivative transaction will result in a loss\ngreater than the principal amount invested,\nand a Fund may not be able to close out a\nderivative transaction at a favorable time or\nprice. Risks associated with derivative\ninstruments include potential changes in value\nin response to interest rate changes or other\nmarket developments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential\nfor the derivative transaction not to have the\neffect the Adviser anticipated or a different\nor less favorable effect than the Adviser\nanticipated; the failure of the counterparty\nto the derivative transaction to perform its\nobligations under the transaction or to settle\na trade; possible mispricing or improper\nvaluation of the derivative instrument;\nimperfect correlation in the value of a\nderivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that a\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including without\nlimitation absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to a\nFund due to losses on the transaction and an\nincrease in volatility; the potential for the\nderivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. Index\nConstruction Risk . A security included in an\nIndex may not exhibit the characteristic or\nprovide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently a Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that\ncharacteristic or exposure. Index Licensing\nRisk . It is possible that the license under\nwhich the Adviser or a Fund is permitted to\nreplicate or otherwise use an Index will be\nterminated or may be disputed, impaired or\ncease to remain in effect. In such a case, the\nAdviser may be required to replace the\nrelevant Index with another index which it\nconsiders to be appropriate in light of the\ninvestment strategy of a Fund. The use of any\nsuch substitute index may have an adverse\nimpact on a Fund's performance. In the event\nthat the Adviser is unable to identify a\nsuitable replacement for the relevant Index,\nit may determine to terminate a Fund.\nLeveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,\nreverse repurchase agreements, certain\nderivatives transactions, securities lending\ntransactions and other investment transactions\nsuch as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or\nforward commitment transactions may create\ninvestment leverage. If a Fund engages in\ntransactions that have a leveraging effect on\nthe Fund's investment portfolio, the value of\nthe Fund will be potentially more volatile and\nall other risks will tend to be compounded.\nThis is because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than a Fund would otherwise have and\nso magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses 25 Table of Contents to a\nFund. Certain derivatives have the potential\nfor unlimited loss, regardless of the size of\nthe initial investment. The use of leverage\nmay cause a Fund to liquidate positions when\nit may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy\nrepayment, interest payment, or margin\nobligations or to meet asset segregation or\ncoverage requirements. Liquidity Risk .\nLiquidity risk is the risk that a Fund may not\nbe able to dispose of securities or close out\nderivatives transactions readily at a\nfavorable time or prices (or at all) or at\nprices approximating those at which a Fund\ncurrently values them. For example, certain\ninvestments may be subject to restrictions on\nresale, may trade in the over-the-counter\nmarket or in limited volume, or may not have\nan active trading market. Illiquid securities\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for a Fund to value illiquid\nsecurities accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. Disposal of illiquid\nsecurities may entail registration expenses\nand other transaction costs that are higher\nthan those for liquid securities. A Fund may\nseek to borrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of\nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing\nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund.\nMoney Market Risk . An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not a deposit of any bank and\nis not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or\nany other government agency. Certain money\nmarket funds seek to preserve the value of\ntheir shares at $1.00 per share, although\nthere can be no assurance that they will do\nso, and it is possible to lose money by\ninvesting in such a money market fund. A major\nor unexpected change in interest rates or a\ndecline in the credit quality of an issuer or\nentity providing credit support, an inactive\ntrading market for money market instruments,\nor adverse market, economic, industry,\npolitical, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause the share price of such\na money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will\nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at\ntimes when the fair value of the money market\nfund's portfolio per share is more or less\nthan $1.00. None of State Street Corporation,\nState Street, State Street Global Advisors\n(\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (\u201cState\nStreet Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an\ninvestment in a money market fund at $1.00 per\nshare. Investors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market\nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV\nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the\nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or\nless than their original purchase price.\nRecent changes in the regulation of money\nmarket funds may affect the operations and\nstructures of money market funds. A money\nmarket fund may be permitted or required to\nimpose redemption fees or to impose\nlimitations on redemptions during periods of\nhigh illiquidity in the markets for the\ninvestments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . A Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to a Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nhave the effect of reducing a Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. A Fund may engage in frequent\ntrading of its portfolio securities in\nconnection with Index rebalancing. Frequent\ntrading may cause a Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent trading. Securities\nLending Risk. Each Fund may lend portfolio\nsecurities in an amount not to exceed 40% of\nthe value of its net assets. For these\npurposes, net assets shall exclude the value\nof all assets received as collateral for the\nloan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by a\nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a\nloan transaction, as compensation for lending\nits securities, a Fund will receive a portion\nof the dividends or interest accrued on the\nsecurities held as collateral or, in the case\nof cash collateral, a portion of the income\nfrom the investment of such cash. In addition,\na Fund will receive the amount of all\ndividends, interest and other distributions on\nthe loaned securities. However, the borrower\nhas the right to vote the loaned securities. A\nFund will call loans to vote proxies if a\nmaterial issue affecting the investment is to\nbe voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities, and may involve expenses to\na Fund. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. Should the borrower of the securities\nfail financially, a Fund may experience delays\nin recovering the securities or exercising its\nrights in the collateral. Loans are made only\nto borrowers that are deemed by the securities\nlending agent to be of good financial\nstanding. In a loan 26\n\nTable of Contents\n\ntransaction, a Fund will also bear the risk of\nany decline in value of securities provided as\ncollateral or acquired with cash collateral.\nEach Fund will attempt to minimize this risk\nby limiting the investment of cash collateral\nto high quality instruments of short maturity\neither directly on behalf of the lending Fund\nor through one or more joint accounts or\nfunds, which may include those managed by the\nAdviser. To the extent the collateral provided\nor investments made with cash collateral\ndiffer from securities included in an Index,\nsuch collateral or investments may have a\ngreater risk of loss than the securities\nincluded in the Index. In addition, a Fund\nwill be subject to the risk that any income\ngenerated by lending its securities or\nreinvesting cash collateral is lower than any\nfees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower.\nThe Adviser will take into account the tax\nimpact to shareholders of substitute payments\nfor dividends when overseeing a Fund's\nsecurities lending activity. Trading Issues .\nAlthough Fund Shares are listed for trading on\nthe Exchange and may be listed or traded on\nU.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than\nthe Exchange, there can be no assurance that\nan active trading market for such Fund Shares\nwill develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange may be halted due to\nmarket conditions or for reasons that, in the\nview of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange is subject to\ntrading halts caused by extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit\nbreaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock\nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While each Fund expects that the\nability of Authorized Participants to create\nand redeem Fund Shares at net asset value\nshould be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of a Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the\ninvestment adviser to each Fund and, subject\nto the oversight of the Board, is responsible\nfor the investment management of each Fund.\nThe Adviser provides an investment management\nprogram for each Fund and manages the\ninvestment of each Fund's assets. The Adviser\nis a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nGlobal Advisors, Inc., which itself is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation. The Adviser is registered with\nthe SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940, as amended. The Adviser and certain\nother affiliates of State Street Corporation\nmake up SSGA.

Index/Trademark\nLicenses/Disclaimers Each Fund's Index\n(collectively, the \u201cIndices\u201d) was created and\nis sponsored by State Street Global Advisors\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d or \u201cSSGA\u201d), an affiliate\nof the Funds and the Funds' Adviser. SSGA or\none or more of its affiliates has entered into\na license agreement with the Funds pursuant to\nwhich the Funds use the Indices at no charge.\nThe Index Provider establishes and maintains\nrules which are used to determine the\ncomposition of the Index and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index. In\norder to minimize any potential for conflicts\ncaused by the fact that SSGA acts as Index\nProvider and its affiliate acts as Advisor to\nthe Funds, SSGA has retained an unaffiliated\nthird party to calculate the Indices (the\n\u201cCalculation Agent\u201d). The Calculation Agent,\nusing the rules-based methodology, will\ncalculate, maintain and disseminate the\nIndices on a daily basis. SSGA will monitor\nthe results produced by the Calculation Agent\nto help ensure that the Indices are being\ncalculated in accordance with the rules-based\nmethodology. In addition, SSGA and the Adviser\nhave established policies and procedures\ndesigned to prevent non-public information\nabout pending changes to the Indices from\nbeing used or disseminated in an improper\nmanner. Furthermore, SSGA and the Adviser have\nestablished policies and procedures designed\nto prevent improper use and dissemination of\nnon-public information about the Funds'\nportfolio strategies.

Additional\nPurchase and Sale Information Fund Shares are\nlisted for secondary trading on the Exchange\nand individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The\nExchange may close early on the business day\nbefore certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules\nare subject to change without notice. If you\nbuy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you will pay the secondary market\nprice for Fund Shares. In addition, you may\nincur customary brokerage commissions and\ncharges and may pay some or all of the spread\nbetween the bid and the offered price in the\nsecondary market on each leg of a round trip\n(purchase and sale) transaction. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares will fluctuate\ncontinuously throughout trading hours based on\nmarket supply and demand rather than the\nrelevant Fund's net asset value, which is\ncalculated at the end of each business day.\nFund Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nprices that may be above ( i.e., at a premium)\nor below ( i.e., at a discount), to varying\ndegrees, the daily net asset value of Fund\nShares. The trading prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the relevant Fund's\nnet asset value during periods of market\nvolatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares\ncan be issued and redeemed daily in Creation\nUnits, the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts and premiums to net asset value\nshould not be sustained over long periods. The\nExchange will disseminate, every fifteen\nseconds during the regular trading day, an\nindicative optimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d)\nrelating to each Fund. The IOPV calculations\nare estimates of the value of each Fund's net\nasset value per Fund Share. Premiums and\ndiscounts between the IOPV and the market\nprice may occur. This should not be viewed as\na \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset value\nper Fund Share. The IOPV is based on the\ncurrent market value of the published basket\nof portfolio securities and/or cash required\nto be deposited in exchange for a Creation\nUnit and does not necessarily reflect the\nprecise composition of a Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. Therefore, the IOPV\nmay not reflect the best possible valuation of\na Fund's current portfolio. Neither the Funds\nnor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are\ninvolved in, or responsible for, the\ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and\nmake no warranty as to their accuracy. 31\nTable of Contents The Funds do not impose any\nrestrictions on the frequency of purchases and\nredemptions; however, the Funds reserve the\nright to reject or limit purchases at any time\nas described in the SAI. When considering that\nno restriction or policy was necessary, the\nBoard evaluated the risks posed by market\ntiming activities, such as whether frequent\npurchases and redemptions would interfere with\nthe efficient implementation of a Fund's\ninvestment strategy, or whether they would\ncause a Fund to experience increased\ntransaction costs. The Board considered that,\nunlike traditional mutual funds, Fund Shares\nare issued and redeemed only in large\nquantities of shares known as Creation Units,\navailable only from a Fund directly, and that\nmost trading in a Fund occurs on the Exchange\nat prevailing market prices and does not\ninvolve the Fund directly. Given this\nstructure, the Board determined that it is\nunlikely that (a) market timing would be\nattempted by a Fund's shareholders or (b) any\nattempts to market time a Fund by shareholders\nwould result in negative impact to the Fund or\nits shareholders. Distributions Dividends and\nCapital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are\nentitled to your share of the applicable\nFund's income and net realized gains on its\ninvestments. Each Fund pays out substantially\nall of its net earnings to its shareholders as\n\u201cdistributions.\u201d Each Fund may earn income\ndividends from stocks, interest from debt\nsecurities and, if participating, securities\nlending income. These amounts, net of expenses\nand taxes (if applicable), are passed along to\nFund shareholders as \u201cincome dividend\ndistributions.\u201d Each Fund will generally\nrealize short-term capital gains or losses\nwhenever it sells or exchanges assets held for\none year or less. Net short-term capital gains\nwill generally be treated as ordinary income\nwhen distributed to shareholders. Each Fund\nwill generally realize long-term capital gains\nor losses whenever it sells or exchanges\nassets held for more than one year. Net\ncapital gains (the excess of a Fund's net\nlong-term capital gains over its net short-\nterm capital losses) are distributed to\nshareholders as \u201ccapital gain distributions.\u201d\nIncome dividend distributions, if any, are\ngenerally distributed to shareholders\nquarterly, but may vary significantly from\nperiod to period. Net capital gains for each\nFund are distributed at least annually.\nDividends may be declared and paid more\nfrequently or at any other time to improve\nIndex tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Code.\nDistributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares\nonly if the broker through whom you purchased\nFund Shares makes such option available.\nDistributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as\nif such distributions had not been reinvested.\nPortfolio Holdings Disclosure The Funds'\nportfolio holdings disclosure policy is\ndescribed in the SAI. In addition, the\nidentities and quantities of the securities\nheld by each Fund are disclosed on the Funds'\nwebsite. Additional Tax Information The\nfollowing discussion is a summary of some\nimportant U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in a Fund. Your investment in a\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes on Distributions.\nIn general, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in a\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from a\nFund will be taxed as either ordinary income\nor qualified dividend income. Subject to\ncertain limitations, dividends that are\nreported by a Fund as qualified dividend\nincome are taxable to noncorporate\nshareholders at rates of up to 20%. Any\ndistributions of a Fund's net capital gains\nare taxable as long-term capital gain\nregardless of how long you have owned Fund\nShares. Long-term capital gains are generally\ntaxed to noncorporate shareholders at rates of\nup to 20%. Distributions in excess of a Fund's\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits\nare treated as a tax-free return of capital to\nthe extent of your basis in the applicable\nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital\ngain thereafter. 32 Table of Contents In\ngeneral, dividends may be reported by a Fund\nas qualified dividend income if they are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by the Fund, which, in general,\nincludes dividend income from taxable U.S.\ncorporations and certain foreign corporations\n( i.e., certain foreign corporations\nincorporated in a possession of the United\nStates or in certain countries with a\ncomprehensive tax treaty with the United\nStates, and certain other foreign corporations\nif the stock with respect to which the\ndividend is paid is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the United\nStates), provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements in respect\nof the stock of such corporations and has not\nhedged its position in the stock in certain\nways. A dividend generally will not be treated\nas qualified dividend income if the dividend\nis received with respect to any share of stock\nheld by a Fund for fewer than 61 days during\nthe 121-day period beginning at the date which\nis 60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, for fewer than 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning 90 days before such\ndate. These holding period requirements will\nalso apply to your ownership of Fund Shares.\nHolding periods may be suspended for these\npurposes for stock that is hedged.\nAdditionally, income derived in connection\nwith a Fund's securities lending activities\nwill not be treated as qualified dividend\nincome. U.S. individuals with income exceeding\nspecified thresholds are subject to a 3.8%\nMedicare contribution tax on all or a portion\nof their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which\nincludes taxable interest, dividends and\ncertain capital gains (generally including\ncapital gain distributions and capital gains\nrealized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This\n3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of\nthe undistributed net investment income of\ncertain shareholders that are estates and\ntrusts. Certain tax-exempt educational\ninstitutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on\nnet investment income. For these purposes,\ncertain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. If you lend your Fund\nShares pursuant to securities lending\narrangements you may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares are\nheld by the borrower) as qualified dividend\nincome. You should consult your financial\nintermediary or tax advisor to discuss your\nparticular circumstances. Distributions paid\nin January, but declared by a Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year,\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth, may be taxable to you in the calendar\nyear in which they were declared. The Funds\nwill inform you of the amount of your ordinary\nincome dividends, qualified dividend income\nand capital gain distributions shortly after\nthe close of each calendar year. A\ndistribution will reduce a Fund's net asset\nvalue per Fund Share and may be taxable to you\nas ordinary income or capital gain even\nthough, from an investment standpoint, the\ndistribution may constitute a return of\ncapital. Derivatives and Other Complex\nSecurities. A Fund may invest in complex\nsecurities. These investments may be subject\nto numerous special and complex rules. These\nrules could affect whether gains and losses\nrecognized by a Fund are treated as ordinary\nincome or capital gain, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to a Fund and/or defer a\nFund's ability to recognize losses. In turn,\nthese rules may affect the amount, timing or\ncharacter of the income distributed to you by\na Fund. You should consult your personal tax\nadvisor regarding the application of these\nrules. Taxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales.\nAny capital gain or loss realized upon a sale\nof Fund Shares is generally treated as long-\nterm capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have\nbeen held for more than one year and as short-\nterm capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have\nbeen held for one year or less, except that\nany capital loss on the sale of Fund Shares\nheld for six months or less is treated as\nlong-term capital loss to the extent that\ncapital gain dividends were paid with respect\nto such Fund Shares. Taxes on Creations and\nRedemptions of Creation Units. A person who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units\ngenerally will recognize a gain or loss. The\ngain or loss will be equal to the difference\nbetween the market value of the Creation Units\nat the time and the exchanger's aggregate\nbasis in the securities surrendered plus any\ncash paid for the Creation Units. A person who\nexchanges Creation Units for securities will\ngenerally recognize a gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the exchanger's basis\nin the Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss\nrealized upon an exchange of securities for\nCreation Units cannot be deducted currently\nunder the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on\nthe basis that there has been no significant\nchange in economic position. Persons\nexchanging securities should consult their own\ntax advisor with respect to whether wash sale\nrules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. 33 Table of Contents Under current\nfederal tax laws, any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon a redemption (or creation) of\nCreation Units is generally treated as long-\nterm capital gain or loss if the applicable\nFund Shares (or securities surrendered) have\nbeen held for more than one year and as a\nshort-term capital gain or loss if the\napplicable Fund Shares (or securities\nsurrendered) have been held for one year or\nless. If you create or redeem Creation Units,\nyou will be sent a confirmation statement\nshowing how many Fund Shares you purchased or\nsold and at what price. The Trust on behalf of\neach Fund has the right to reject an order for\nCreation Units if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund and\nif, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the\napplicable Fund would have a basis in the\nsecurities different from the market value of\nthe securities on the date of deposit. The\nTrust also has the right to require\ninformation necessary to determine beneficial\nshare ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund, the\npurchaser (or group of purchasers) will not\nrecognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If a Fund\nredeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear\nadditional costs and recognize more capital\ngains than it would if it redeems Creation\nUnits in-kind. Non-U.S. Investors. Ordinary\nincome dividends paid by a Fund to\nshareholders who are non-resident aliens or\nforeign entities will generally be subject to\na 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than\ndistributions reported by the Fund as\ninterest-related dividends and short-term\ncapital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty\nrate applies or unless such income is\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, a Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of\nits net income derived from U.S.-source\ninterest, and a Fund may report short-term\ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains\non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a trade or business within the\nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax\nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of a\nFund's shares are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment. Unless certain\nnon-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply\nwith IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding\nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions payable to such\nentities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt\nfrom the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund will be\nrequired in certain cases to withhold (as\n\u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts payable to\nany shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States.\nOther Tax Issues. A Fund may be subject to tax\nin certain states where the Fund does business\n(or is treated as doing business as a result\nof its investments). Furthermore, in those\nstates which have income tax laws, the tax\ntreatment of the Funds and of Fund\nshareholders with respect to distributions by\nthe Funds may differ from federal tax\ntreatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes\nsome of the consequences under current federal\nincome tax law of an investment in the Funds.\nIt is not a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. Consult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax consequences of an\ninvestment in the Funds under all applicable\ntax laws. 34 Table of Contents General\nInformation The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nIf shareholders of any Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled\nto one vote for each Fund Share they own.\nAnnual meetings of shareholders will not be\nheld except as required by the 1940 Act and\nother applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization Each\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. For purposes of the 1940\nAct, Fund Shares are issued by the respective\nseries of the Trust and the acquisition of\nFund Shares by investment companies is subject\nto the restrictions of Section 12(d)(1) of the\n1940 Act. The Trust has received exemptive\nrelief from Section 12(d)(1) to allow\nregistered investment companies to invest in\nthe Funds beyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions as set forth in an SEC exemptive\norder issued to the Trust, including that such\ninvestment companies enter into an agreement\nwith the Trust. From time to time, a Fund may\nadvertise yield and total return figures.\nYield is a historical measure of dividend\nincome, and total return is a measure of past\ndividend income (assuming that it has been\nreinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither\nyield nor total return should be used to\npredict the future performance of a Fund.\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel\nto the Trust, including the Funds. Ernst &\nYoung LLP serves as the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and will audit the\nFunds' financial statements annually.\nFinancial Highlights These financial highlight\ntables are intended to help you understand\neach Fund's financial performance for the past\nfive fiscal years or, if shorter, the period\nsince a Fund's inception. Certain information\nreflects the performance results for a single\nFund Share. The total returns in the table\nrepresent the rate that an investor would have\nearned (or lost) on an investment in each Fund\n(assuming reinvestment of all dividends and\ndistributions). This information has been\naudited by Ernst & Young LLP, the Trust's\nindependent registered public accounting firm,\nwhose report, along with each Fund's financial\nhighlights and financial statements, is\nincluded in the annual report to shareholders,\nwhich is available upon request.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $14        $44     $77     $174  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 0% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays 1-3\nMonth U.S. Treasury\nBill Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser).\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is designed to\nmeasure the performance\nof public obligations\nof the U.S. Treasury\nthat have a remaining\nmaturity of greater\nthan or equal to 1\nmonth and less than 3\nmonths. The Index\nincludes all publicly\nissued U.S. Treasury\nBills that have a\nremaining maturity of\nless than 3 months and\nat least 1 month, and\nare rated investment-\ngrade. In addition, the\nsecurities must be\ndenominated in U.S.\ndollars and must have a\nfixed rate. The Index\nis market\ncapitalization\nweighted, with\nsecurities held in the\nFederal Reserve System\nOpen Market Account\n(the portfolio of U.S.\nTreasuries, Federal\nAgency securities, and\nforeign currency\ninvestments held by the\nU.S Federal Reserve\nBank)deducted from the\ntotal amount\noutstanding. Securities\nin the Index are\nupdated on the last\nbusiness day of each\nmonth. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 14\nsecurities in the Index\n. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis).If the principal\non a debt obligation is\nprepaid before\nexpected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations\nRisk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ\nfrom other fixed income\nsecurities in their\ninterest rates,\nmaturities, times of\nissuance and other\ncharacteristics.\nSimilar to other\nissuers, changes to the\nfinancial condition or\ncredit rating of the\nU.S. government may\ncause the value of the\nFund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or redeem\nthe securities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. 2 Table of\nContents Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e.,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Low\nShort-Term Interest\nRates Risk: During\nmarket conditions in\nwhich short-term\ninterest rates are at\nlow levels, the Fund's\nyield can be very low,\nand the Fund may have a\nnegative yield (i.e.,\nit may lose money on an\noperating basis).\nDuring these\nconditions, it is\npossible that the Fund\nwill generate an\ninsufficient amount of\nincome to pay its\nexpenses, and will not\nbe able to pay its\nscheduled dividend. In\naddition, it is\npossible that during\nthese conditions the\nFund may experience\ndifficulties purchasing\nand/or selling\nsecurities with respect\nto scheduled\nrebalances, and may, as\na result, maintain a\nportion of its assets\nin cash, on which it\nmay earn little, if\nany, income. Such\nmarket conditions may\nadversely affect the\nFund's ability to\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex. Securities\nLending Risk: The Fund\nmay engage in\nsecurities lending.\nSecurities lending\ninvolves the risk that\nthe borrower of the\nloaned securities fails\nto return the\nsecurities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The\nFund could also lose\nmoney due to a decline\nin the value of\ncollateral provided for\nloaned securities or\nany investments made\nwith cash collateral.\nThese events could also\ntrigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the\nFund. To the extent the\ncollateral provided or\ninvestments made with\ncash collateral differ\nfrom securities\nincluded in the Index,\nsuch collateral or\ninvestments may have a\ngreater risk of loss\nthan the securities\nincluded in the Index.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. 3 Table of\nContents\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Todd Bean, Sean\nLussier and April Borawski. Todd Bean, CFA, is\na Vice President of the Adviser and Head of\nU.S. Traditional Cash Strategies in the Global\nFixed Income, Cash and Currency Team. He\njoined the Adviser in 2002. Sean Lussier is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Fixed Income,\nCash and Currency Team. He joined the Adviser\nin 2004. April Borawski is a Principal of the\nAdviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Global\nFixed Income, Cash and Currency Team. She\njoined the Adviser in 2015. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n4\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 17% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays 1-10\nYear U.S. Government\nInflation-Linked Bond\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.

The Index is\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of the\ninflation protected\npublic obligations of\nthe U.S. Treasury\ncommonly known as\n\u201cTIPS\u201d that have a\nremaining maturity\ngreater than or equal\nto 1 year and less than\n10 years.\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents TIPS\nare securities issued\nby the U.S. Treasury\nthat are designed to\nprovide inflation\nprotection to\ninvestors. The Index\nincludes publicly\nissued TIPS that have\nat least 1 year and\nless than 10 years\nremaining to maturity\non the index\nrebalancing date, with\nan issue size equal to\nor in excess of $500\nmillion. The total\namount outstanding for\neach issue is\nreflected, there are no\nadjustments made for\nsums held in the\nFederal Reserve System\nOpen Market Account\n(SOMA) account. Bonds\nmust be capital-indexed\nand linked to a\ndomestic inflation\nindex. The securities\nmust be issued by the\nU.S. Government and\nmust be denominated in\nU.S. dollars and pay\ncoupon and principal in\nU.S. dollars. New\nbonds/ reopening's\nentering the Index must\nsettle on or before the\nindex rebalancing date.\nThe Index is rebalanced\non the last calendar\ndate of each month. As\nof July 31, 2020, the\nIndex comprised 30\nsecurities. The Index\nis sponsored by\nBloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: T he\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchanges in interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations\nRisk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ\nfrom other fixed income\nsecurities in their\ninterest rates,\nmaturities, times of\nissuance and other\ncharacteristics.\nSimilar to other\nissuers, changes to the\nfinancial condition or\ncredit rating of the\nU.S. government may\ncause the value of the\nFund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline.\nInflation-Indexed\nSecurities Risk: The\nprincipal amount of an\ninflation-indexed\nsecurity typically\nincreases with\ninflation and decreases\nwith deflation, as\nmeasured by a specified\nindex. It is possible\nthat, in a period of\ndeclining inflation\nrates, the Fund could\nreceive at maturity\nless than the initial\nprincipal amount of an\ninflation-indexed\nsecurity. Changes in\nthe values of\ninflation-indexed\nsecurities may be\ndifficult to predict,\nand it is possible that\nan investment in such\nsecurities will have an\neffect different from\nthat anticipated.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. 7 Table of\nContents Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or redeem\nthe securities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nSecurities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may\nengage in securities\nlending. Securities\nlending involves the\nrisk that the borrower\nof the loaned\nsecurities fails to\nreturn the securities\nin a timely manner or\nat all. The Fund could\nalso lose money due to\na decline in the value\nof collateral provided\nfor loaned securities\nor any investments made\nwith cash collateral.\nThese events could also\ntrigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the\nFund. To the extent the\ncollateral provided or\ninvestments made with\ncash collateral differ\nfrom securities\nincluded in the Index,\nsuch collateral or\ninvestments may have a\ngreater risk of loss\nthan the securities\nincluded in the Index.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. 8 Table of\nContents\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are James Kramer,\nCynthia Moy and Orhan Imer. James Kramer is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1996. Cynthia Moy is a Principal of the\nAdviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed\nIncome Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2007. Orhan Imer, CFA, Ph.D., is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or\nvisit your financial intermediary's website\nfor more information. 10 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeBloomberg Barclays Convertible\nSecurities ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Convertible     \n  Securities                                  \n  ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide           \n  investment                                  \n  results that, before fees and expenses,     \n  correspond                                  \n  generally to the price and yield            \n  performance of an                           \n  index that tracks United States             \n  convertible                                 \n  securities markets.                         \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 41% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays U.S.\nConvertible Liquid Bond\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\n\n11 Table of Contents\n\nThe Index is designed\nto represent the market\nof U.S. convertible\nsecurities, such as\nconvertible bonds and\nconvertible preferred\nstock. Convertible\nbonds are bonds that\ncan be exchanged, at\nthe option of the\nholder or issuer, for a\nspecific number of\nshares of the issuer's\nequity securities.\nConvertible preferred\nstock is preferred\nstock that includes an\noption for the holder\nto convert to common\nstock. The Index\ncomponents are a subset\nof issues in the\nBloomberg Barclays\nConvertible Composite\nIndex. To be included\nin the Index, a\nsecurity must meet the\nfollowing requirements:\n(i) have an issue\namount of at least $350\nmillion and a par\namount outstanding of\nat least $250 million;\n(ii) be a non-called,\nnon-defaulted security;\n(iii) have at least 31\ndays until maturity;\n(iv) be U.S. dollar\ndenominated; and (v) be\na registered or a\nconvertible tranche\nissued under Rule 144A\nof the Securities Act\nof 1933, as amended.\nThe Index may include\ninvestment grade, below\ninvestment grade and\nunrated securities. The\nIndex is rebalanced on\na monthly basis on the\nlast business day of\nthe month. As of June\n30, 2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe technology ,\ncommunication\nservicesand consumer\nnon-cyclicalsectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 241\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis).If the principal\non a debt obligation is\nprepaid before\nexpected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. Convertible\nSecurities Risk:\nConvertible securities\nmay be subordinate to\nother debt securities\nissued by the same\nissuer. Issuers of\nconvertible securities\nare often not as strong\nfinancially as issuers\nwith higher credit\nratings. Convertible\nsecurities typically\nprovide yields lower\nthan comparable non-\nconvertible securities.\nTheir values may be\nmore volatile than\nthose of non-\nconvertible securities,\nreflecting changes in\nthe values of the\nsecurities into which\nthey are convertible.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be\ntimeswhen the market\nprice of the shares is\nmore than the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. 12 Table of\nContents Below\nInvestment-Grade\nSecurities Risk: Lower-\nquality debt securities\n(\u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d\nbonds) are considered\npredominantly\nspeculative, and can\ninvolve a substantially\ngreater risk of default\nthan higher quality\ndebt securities.\nIssuers of lower-\nquality debt securities\nmay have substantially\ngreater risk of\ninsolvency or\nbankruptcy than issuers\nof higher-quality debt\nsecurities. They can be\nilliquid, and their\nvalues can have\nsignificant volatility\nand may decline\nsignificantly over\nshort periods of time.\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities tend to be\nmore sensitive to\nadverse news about the\nissuer, or the market\nor economy in general.\nCommunication Services\nSector Risk:\nCommunication services\ncompanies are\nparticularly vulnerable\nto the potential\nobsolescence of\nproducts and services\ndue to technological\nadvancement and the\ninnovation of\ncompetitors. Companies\nin the communication\nservices sector may\nalso be affected by\nother competitive\npressures, such as\npricing competition, as\nwell as research and\ndevelopment costs,\nsubstantial capital\nrequirements and\ngovernment regulation.\nAdditionally,\nfluctuating domestic\nand international\ndemand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes\nin consumer tastes can\ndrastically affect a\ncommunication services\ncompany's\nprofitability. While\nall companies may be\nsusceptible to network\nsecurity breaches,\ncertain companies in\nthe communication\nservices sector may be\nparticular targets of\nhacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or\nconsumer information or\ndisruptions in service,\nwhich could have a\nmaterial adverse effect\non their businesses.\nConsumer Non-Cyclical\nSector Risk:\nInvestments in the\nconsumer non-cyclical\nsector involve risks\nassociated with\ncompanies that\nmanufacture products\nand provide\ndiscretionary services\ndirectly to the\nconsumer. Performance\nof companies in the\nconsumer non-cyclical\nsector may be adversely\nimpacted by\nfluctuations in supply\nand demand, changes in\nthe global economy,\nconsumer spending,\ncompetition,\ndemographics and\nconsumer preferences,\nand production\nspending. Companies in\nthe consumer non-\ncyclical sector are\nalso affected by\nchanges in government\nregulation, global\neconomic, environmental\nand political events,\nand economic\nconditions. Income\nRisk: The Fund's income\nmay decline due to\nfalling interest rates\nor other factors.\nIssuers of securities\nheld by the Fund may\ncall or redeem the\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S.\nentity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks\n13 Table of Contents\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security and\nthe last quoted price\nfor the underlying\nsecurity on the closed\nforeign market. These\ndeviations could result\nin the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities\ntraded on foreign\nmarkets may be less\nliquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital\nto the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent\nthat the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated\nin a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks\nsuch as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates\nand the risk that a\nforeign government\ncould regulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant impact\non the Fund. Certain\ncountries have recently\nexperienced (or\ncurrently are expected\nto experience) negative\ninterest rates on\ncertain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar\ninterest rate\nconditions may be\nexperienced in other\nregions. Investments in\nfixed-income securities\nwith very low or\nnegative interest rates\nmay magnify the Fund's\nsusceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and\nperformance, and such\ninvestments may be\nsubject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced\nliquidity. Preferred\nSecurities Risk:\nGenerally, preferred\nsecurity holders have\nno or limited voting\nrights with respect to\nthe issuing company. In\naddition, preferred\nsecurities are\nsubordinated to bonds\nand other debt\ninstruments in a\ncompany's capital\nstructure and therefore\nwill be subject to\ngreater credit risk\nthan those debt\ninstruments. Dividend\npayments on a preferred\nsecurity typically must\nbe declared by the\nissuer's board of\ndirectors. In the event\nan issuer of preferred\nsecurities experiences\neconomic difficulties,\nthe issuer's preferred\nsecurities may lose\nsubstantial value due\nto the reduced\nlikelihood that the\nissuer's board of\ndirectors will declare\na dividend and the fact\nthat the preferred\nsecurity may be\nsubordinated to other\nsecurities of the same\nissuer. Further,\nbecause many preferred\nsecurities pay\ndividends at a fixed\nrate, their market\nprice can be sensitive\nto changes in interest\nrates in a manner\nsimilar to bonds \u2014 that\nis, as interest rates\nrise, the value of the\npreferred securities\nheld by the Fund are\nlikely to decline. In\naddition, because many\npreferred securities\nallow holders to\nconvert the preferred\nsecurities into common\nstock of the issuer,\ntheir market price can\nbe sensitive to changes\nin the value of the\nissuer's common stock\nand, therefore,\ndeclining common stock\nvalues may also cause\nthe value of the Fund's\ninvestments to decline.\nPreferred securities\noften have call\nfeatures which allow\nthe issuer to redeem\nthe security at its\ndiscretion. The\nredemption of a\npreferred security\nhaving a higher than\naverage yield may cause\na decrease in the\nFund's yield.\nRestricted Securities\nRisk: The Fund may hold\nsecurities that have\nnot been registered for\nsale to the public\nunder the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat a trading market\nwill exist at any time\nfor any particular\nrestricted security.\nLimitations on the\nresale of these\nsecurities may have an\nadverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may\nprevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them\npromptly at reasonable\nprices. The Fund may\nhave to bear the\nexpense of registering\nthe securities for\nresale and the risk of\nsubstantial delays in\neffecting the\nregistration. Also,\nrestricted securities\nmay be difficult to\nvalue because market\nquotations may not be\nreadily available, and\nthe securities may have\nsignificant volatility.\nTechnology Sector Risk:\nMarket or economic\nfactors impacting\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n14 Table of Contents\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs.\n\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income,\nqualified dividend income and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or\nvisit your financial intermediary's website\nfor more information. 16 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeBloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield      \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment    \n  results                                     \n  that, before fees and expenses, correspond  \n  generally to the price and yield            \n  performance of an                           \n  index that tracks the U.S. high yield       \n  corporate                                   \n  bond market.                                \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.40%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.40%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $41       $128    $224     $505  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 50%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nHigh Yield Very Liquid\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines\nhave economic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\ndebt securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\n17 Table of Contents\n\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Fund may use\nderivatives, including\ncredit default swaps\nand credit default\nindex swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure\nthat the Adviser\nexpects to correlate\nclosely with the\nIndex, or a portion of\nthe Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is designed\nto measure the\nperformance of\npublicly issued U.S.\ndollar denominated\nhigh yield corporate\nbonds with above-\naverage liquidity.\nHigh yield securities\nare generally rated\nbelow investment-grade\nand are commonly\nreferred to as \u201cjunk\nbonds.\u201d The Index\nincludes publicly\nissued U.S. dollar\ndenominated, non-\ninvestment-grade,\nfixed-rate, taxable\ncorporate bonds that\nhave a remaining\nmaturity of at least\none year, but not more\nthan fifteen years,\nregardless of\noptionality; are rated\nhigh-yield\n(Ba1/BB+/BB+ or below)\nusing the middle\nrating of Moody's\nInvestors Service,\nInc., Fitch Inc., or\nStandard & Poor's\nFinancial Services,\nLLC, respectively; and\nhave $500 million or\nmore of outstanding\nface value. To be\neligible for inclusion\nin the Index, a bond\nmust have been issued\nwithin the past five\nyears. Exposure to\neach eligible issuer\nwill be capped at two\npercent of the Index.\nIn addition,\nsecurities must be\nregistered, exempt\nfrom registration at\nthe time of issuance\nor issued under Rule\n144A of the Securities\nAct of 1933, as\namended. Original\nissue zero coupon\nbonds, step-up coupons\nthat change according\nto a predetermined\nschedule, and payment-\nin-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d)\nsecurities and toggle\nnotes paying interest\nin cash are also\neligible. In addition,\ncallable fixed-to-\nfloating rate and\nfixed-to-variable\nbonds are eligible\nduring their fixed-\nrate term only. The\nIndex includes only\ncorporate sectors. The\ncorporate sectors are\nIndustrial, Utility,\nand Financial\nInstitutions.\nSecurities excluded\nfrom the Index include\nnon-corporate bonds,\nstructured notes,\nprivate placements,\nbonds with equity-type\nfeatures (e.g.,\nwarrants,\nconvertibility),\nfloating-rate issues,\nEurobonds , defaulted\nbonds, partial PIK\nsecurities, PIK\nsecurities and toggle\nnotes paying interest\nin-kind, and emerging\nmarket bonds. The\nIndex is issuer capped\nand the securities in\nthe Index are updated\non the last business\nday of each month. As\nof June 30 , 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nconsumer cyclical ,\nconsumer non-cyclical\nand communication\nservices sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 1,008\nsecurities in the\nIndex .\n\nThe Index is\nsponsoredby Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with\nthe Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines\nthe composition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may\nincrease or decrease\nas a result of the\nfollowing: market\nfluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or\nilliquidity in debt\nsecurities markets;\nthe risk of low rates\nof return due to\nreinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling\ninterest rates. To the\nextent that interest\nrates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities to\ndecrease, an adverse\nimpact on the\nliquidity of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities, and\nincreased volatility\nof the fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates\nare at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis).If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes\nin interest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values\nof debt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the\nreturns on other\ninvestment options,\nincluding investments\nin equity securities.\n18 Table of Contents\nBelow Investment-Grade\nSecurities Risk:\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities (\u201chigh\nyield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d\nbonds) are considered\npredominantly\nspeculative, and can\ninvolve a\nsubstantially greater\nrisk of default than\nhigher quality debt\nsecurities. Issuers of\nlower-quality debt\nsecurities may have\nsubstan tially greater\nrisk of insolvency or\nbankruptcy than\nissuers of higher-\nquality debt\nsecurities. They can\nbe illiquid, and their\nvalues can have\nsignificant volatility\nand may decline\nsignificantly over\nshort periods of time.\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities tend to be\nmore sensitive to\nadverse news about the\nissuer, or the market\nor economy in general.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCommunication Services\nSector Risk:\nCommunication services\ncompanies are\nparticularly\nvulnerable to the\npotential obsolescence\nof products and\nservices due to\ntechnological\nadvancement and the\ninnovation of\ncompetitors. Companies\nin the communication\nservices sector may\nalso be affected by\nother competitive\npressures, such as\npricing competition,\nas well as research\nand development costs,\nsubstantial capital\nrequirements and\ngovernment regulation.\nAdditionally,\nfluctuating domestic\nand international\ndemand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes\nin consumer tastes can\ndrastically affect a\ncommunication services\ncompany's\nprofitability. While\nall companies may be\nsusceptible to network\nsecurity breaches,\ncertain companies in\nthe communication\nservices sector may be\nparticular targets of\nhacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary\nor consumer\ninformation or\ndisruptions in\nservice, which could\nhave a material\nadverse effect on\ntheir businesses.\nConsumer Cyclical\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the consumer\ncyclical sector are\nlargely impacted by\nthe performance of the\noverall global\neconomy, changes in\ninterest rates,\nfluctuations in supply\nand demand, and\nchanges in consumer\npreferences. Success\ndepends heavily on\ndisposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. As a result,\nconsumer cyclical\ncompanies may be\nadversely affected and\nlose value quickly in\nperiods of economic\ndownturns. Consumer\nNon-Cyclical Sector\nRisk: Investments in\nthe consumer non-\ncyclical sector\ninvolve risks\nassociated with\ncompanies that\nmanufacture products\nand provide\ndiscretionary services\ndirectly to the\nconsumer. Performance\nof companies in the\nconsumer non-cyclical\nsector may be\nadversely impacted by\nfluctuations in supply\nand demand, changes in\nthe global economy,\nconsumer spending,\ncompetition,\ndemographics and\nconsumer preferences,\nand production\nspending. Companies in\nthe consumer non-\ncyclical sector are\nalso affected by\nchanges in government\nregulation, global\neconomic,\nenvironmental and\npolitical events, and\neconomic conditions.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Income\nRisk: The Fund's\nincome may decline due\nto falling interest\nrates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or\nredeem the securities\nduring periods of\nfalling interest\nrates, and the Fund\nwould likely be\nrequired to reinvest\nin securities paying\nlower interest rates.\nIf an obligation held\nby the Fund is\nprepaid, the Fund may\nhave to re invest the\nprepayment in other\nobligations paying\nincome at lower rates.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than 19\nTable of Contents\n\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions .\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nRestricted Securities\nRisk: The Fund may\nhold securities that\nhave not been\nregistered for sale to\nthe public under the\nU.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat a trading market\nwill exist at any time\nfor any particular\nrestricted security.\nLimitations on the\nresale of these\nsecurities may have an\nadverse effect on\ntheir marketability,\nand may prevent the\nFund from disposing of\nthem promptly at\nreasonable prices. The\nFund may have to bear\nthe expense of\nregistering the\nsecurities for resale\nand the risk of\nsubstantial delays in\neffecting the\nregistration. Also,\nrestricted securities\nmay be difficult to\nvalue because market\nquotations may not be\nreadily available, and\nthe securities may\nhave significant\nvolatility. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially\na large portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 27% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays U.S.\nDollar Floating Rate\nNote < 5 Years Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money market\nfunds advised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Index is designed\nto measure the\nperformance of U.S.\ndollar-denominated,\ninvestment grade\nfloating rate notes.\nSecurities in the Index\nmust have a remaining\nmaturity of greater\nthan or equal to one\nmonth and less than\nfive years, and have\n$300 million or more of\noutstanding face value.\nIn addition, securities\nin the Index must be\nrated investment grade\n(Baa3, BBB- or BBB- by\nMoody's Investors\nService, Standard &\nPoor's Financial\nServices, LLC or Fitch\nInc., respectively).\nThe Index consists of\ndebt instruments that\npay a variable coupon\nrate (e.g., based on\nthe 3-month LIBOR) with\na fixed spread. The\nIndex may include U.S.\nregistered, dollar\ndenominated bonds of\nnon-U.S. corporations,\ngovernments and\nsupranational entities,\nas well as securities\nthat are subject to\nrestrictions on resale\nunder the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws\n(\u201crestricted\nsecurities\u201d). Excluded\nfrom the Index are\nfixed rate bullet\nbonds, fixed-rate\nputtable and fixed-rate\ncallable bonds, fixed\nrate and fixed to\nfloating capital\nsecurities, bonds with\nequity-linked features\n(e.g. warrants and\nconvertibles),\ninflation linked bonds\nand securitized bonds.\nThe Index is market\ncapitalization weighted\nand the securities in\nthe Index are updated\non the last calendar\nday of each month. As\nof June 30, 2020, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 510\nsecurities in the Index\nand the average credit\nquality of the\nsecurities in the Index\nwas A1/A2. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchanges in interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. Variable\nand Floating Rate\nSecurities Risk: During\nperiods of increasing\ninterest rates, changes\nin the coupon rates of\nvariable or floating\nrate securities may lag\nbehind the changes in\nmarket rates or may\nhave limits on the\nmaximum increases in\ncoupon rates.\nAlternatively, during\nperiods of declining\ninterest rates, the\ncoupon rates on such\nsecurities will\ntypically readjust\ndownward resulting in a\nlower yield. In\naddition, investment in\nderivative variable\nrate securities, such\nas inverse floaters,\nwhose rates vary\ninversely with market\nrates of interest, or\nrange floaters or\ncapped floaters, whose\nrates are subject to\nperiodic or lifetime\ncaps, or in securities\nthat pay a rate of\ninterest determined by\napplying a multiple to\nthe variable rate\ninvolves special risks\nas compared to\ninvestment in a 23\nTable of Contents\nfixed-rate security and\nmay involve leverage.\nFloating rate notes are\ngenerally subject to\nlegal or contractual\nrestrictions on resale,\nmay trade infrequently,\nand their value may be\nimpaired when the Fund\nneeds to liquidate such\nsecurities. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or redeem\nthe securities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. LIBOR Risk: On\nJuly 27, 2017, the\nUnited Kingdom's\nFinancial Conduct\nAuthority, which\nregulates LIBOR,\nannounced that it\nintends to phase out\nLIBOR by the end of\n2021. There remains\nuncertainty regarding\nthe future of LIBOR and\nthe nature of any\nreplacement rate. The\nreplacement and/or\ndiscontinuation of\nLIBOR could lead to\nsignificant short-term\nand long-term\nuncertainty and market\ninstability. The\nunavailability and/or\ndiscontinuation of\nLIBOR could have\nadverse impacts on\nnewly issued financial\ninstruments and\nexisting financial\ninstruments that\nreference LIBOR. While\nsome instruments may\ncontemplate a scenario\nwhere LIBOR is no\nlonger available by\nproviding for an\nalternative rate\nsetting methodology,\nnot all instruments may\nhave such provisions\nand there is\nuncertainty regarding\nthe effectiveness of\nany alternative\nmethodology. In\naddition, the\nunavailability or 24\nTable of Contents\nreplacement of LIBOR\nmay affect the value,\nliquidity or return on\ncertain Fund\ninvestments and may\nresult in costs\nincurred in connection\nwith closing out\npositions and entering\ninto new trades.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S.\nentity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security and\nthe last quoted price\nfor the underlying\nsecurity on the closed\nforeign market. These\ndeviations could result\nin the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities\ntraded on foreign\nmarkets may be less\nliquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital\nto the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent\nthat the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated\nin a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks\nsuch as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates\nand the risk that a\nforeign government\ncould regulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant impact\non the Fund. Certain\ncountries have recently\nexperienced (or\ncurrently are expected\nto experience) negative\ninterest rates on\ncertain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar\ninterest rate\nconditions may be\nexperienced in other\nregions. Investments in\nfixed-income securities\nwith very low or\nnegative interest rates\nmay magnify the Fund's\nsusceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and\nperformance, and such\ninvestments may be\nsubject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced\nliquidity. Restricted\nSecurities Risk: The\nFund may hold\nsecurities that have\nnot been registered for\nsale to the public\nunder the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat a trading market\nwill exist at any time\nfor any particular\nrestricted security.\nLimitations on the\nresale of these\nsecurities may have an\nadverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may\nprevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them\npromptly at reasonable\nprices. The Fund may\nhave to bear the\nexpense of registering\nthe securities for\nresale and the risk of\nsubstantial delays in\neffecting the\nregistration. Also,\nrestricted securities\nmay be difficult to\nvalue because market\nquotations may not be\nreadily available, and\nthe securities may have\nsignificant volatility.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. 25 Table of\nContents Fund\nPerformance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n26\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same.

These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 90%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays US\nHigh Yield 350mn Cash\nPay 0-5 Yr 2% Capped\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines\nhave economic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\ndebt securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\n28\n\nTable of Contents\nindustry or group of\nind ustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Fund may use\nderivatives, including\ncredit default swaps\nand credit default\nindex swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure\nthat the Adviser\nexpects to correlate\nclosely with the\nIndex, or a portion of\nthe Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is designed\nto measure the\nperformance of short-\ntermpublicly issued\nU.S. dollar-\ndenominated high yield\ncorporate bonds. High\nyield securities are\ngenerally rated below\ninvestment-grade and\nare commonly referred\nto as \u201cjunk\u201d bonds.\nThe Index includes\npublicly issued U.S.\ndollar denominated,\nnon-investment-grade,\nfixed rate, taxable\ncorporate bonds that\nhave a remaining\nmaturity of less than\n5 years regardless of\noptionality, are rated\nbetween Caa3/CCC-/CCC-\nand Ba1/BB+/BB+ using\nthe middle rating of\nMoody's Investors\nService, Inc., Fitch,\nInc., or Standard &\nPoor's Financial\nServices, LLC,\nrespectively, and have\nat least a $350\nmillion outstanding\npar value. The Index\nincludes only\ncorporate sectors. The\ncorporate sectors are\nIndustrial, Utility\nand Financial\nInstitutions.\nSecurities included in\nthe Index may include\nsecurities that are\nsubject to\nrestrictions on resale\nunder the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws\n(\u201crestricted\nsecurities\u201d). Excluded\nfrom the Index are\nnon-corporate bonds,\nstructured notes with\nembedded swaps or\nother special\nfeatures, bonds with\nequity-type features\n(e.g., warrants,\nconvertibility),\nfloating-rate\nsecurities and\nsecurities that move\nfrom fixed to\nfloating-rate,\nEmerging Market Bonds,\ndefaulted bonds,\noriginal issue zero\ncoupon bonds, private\nplacements and payment\nin kind securities.\nThe Index is issuer-\ncapped and the\nsecurities in the\nIndex are updated on\nthe index rebalancing\ndate. The securities\nin the Index are\nupdated on the last\nbusiness day of each\nmonth. As of June 30,\n2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe consumer cyclical,\nconsumer non-cyclical\nand communication\nservices sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 774\nsecurities in the\nIndex and the dollar-\nweighted average\nmaturity of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex was 3.45 years.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby Bloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may\nincrease or decrease\nas a result of the\nfollowing: market\nfluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or\nilliquidity in debt\nsecurities markets;\nthe risk of low rates\nof return due to\nreinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling\ninterest rates. To the\nextent that interest\nrates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities to\ndecrease, an adverse\nimpact on the\nliquidity of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities, and\nincreased volatility\nof the fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates\nare at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis).If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes\nin interest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values\nof debt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the\nreturns on other\ninvestment options,\nincluding investments\nin equity securities.\nBelow Investment-Grade\nSecurities Risk:\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities (\u201chigh\nyield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d\nbonds) are considered\npredominantly\nspeculative, and can\ninvolve a\nsubstantially greater\nrisk of default than\nhigher quality debt\nsecurities. Issuers of\nlower-quality debt\nsecurities may have\nsubstantially greater\nrisk of insolvency or\nbankruptcy than\nissuers of higher-\nquality debt\nsecurities. They can\nbe illiquid, and their\nvalues can have\nsignificant 29 Table\nof Contents volatility\nand may decline\nsignificantly over\nshort periods of time.\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities tend to be\nmore sensitive to\nadverse news about the\nissuer, or the market\nor economy in general.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCommunication Services\nSector Risk:\nCommunication services\ncompanies are\nparticularly\nvulnerable to the\npotential obsolescence\nof products and\nservices due to\ntechnological\nadvancement and the\ninnovation of\ncompetitors. Companies\nin the communication\nservices sector may\nalso be affected by\nother competitive\npressures, such as\npricing competition,\nas well as research\nand development costs,\nsubstantial capital\nrequirements and\ngovernment regulation.\nAdditionally,\nfluctuating domestic\nand international\ndemand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes\nin consumer tastes can\ndrastically affect a\ncommunication services\ncompany's\nprofitability. While\nall companies may be\nsusceptible to network\nsecurity breaches,\ncertain companies in\nthe communication\nservices sector may be\nparticular targets of\nhacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary\nor consumer\ninformation or\ndisruptions in\nservice, which could\nhave a material\nadverse effect on\ntheir businesses.\nConsumer\nCyclicalSector Risk:\nCompanies in\ntheconsumer cyclical\nsector are largely\nimpacted bythe\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, changes\nininterest rates,\nfluctuations in supply\nand demand,and changes\ninconsumer\npreferences. Success\ndepends heavily on\ndisposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. As a result,\nconsumer\ncyclicalcompanies may\nbe adversely affected\nand lose value quickly\nin periods of economic\ndownturns . Consumer\nNon-Cyclical Sector\nRisk: Investments in\nthe consumer non-\ncyclical sector\ninvolve risks\nassociated with\ncompanies that\nmanufacture products\nand provide\ndiscretionary services\ndirectly to the\nconsumer. Performance\nof companies in the\nconsumer non-cyclical\nsector may be\nadversely impacted by\nfluctuations in supply\nand demand, changes in\nthe global economy,\nconsumer spending,\ncompetition,\ndemographics and\nconsumer preferences,\nand production\nspending. Companies in\nthe consumer non-\ncyclical sector are\nalso affected by\nchanges in government\nregulation, global\neconomic,\nenvironmental and\npolitical events, and\neconomic conditions.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Income\nRisk: The Fund's\nincome may decline due\nto falling interest\nrates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or\nredeem the securities\nduring periods of\nfalling interest\nrates, and the Fund\nwould likely be\nrequired to reinvest\nin securities paying\nlower interest rates.\nIf an obligation held\nby the Fund is\nprepaid, the Fund may\nhave to reinvest the\nprepayment in other\nobligations paying\nincome at lower rates.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe 30 Table of\nContents borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e., achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nRestricted Securities\nRisk: The Fund may\nhold securities that\nhave not been\nregistered for sale to\nthe public under the\nU.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat a trading market\nwill exist at any time\nfor any particular\nrestricted security.\nLimitations on the\nresale of these\nsecurities may have an\nadverse effect on\ntheir marketability,\nand may prevent the\nFund from disposing of\nthem promptly at\nreasonable prices. The\nFund may have to bear\nthe expense of\nregistering the\nsecurities for resale\nand the risk of\nsubstantial delays in\neffecting the\nregistration. Also,\nrestricted securities\nmay be difficult to\nvalue because market\nquotations may not be\nreadily available, and\nthe securities may\nhave significant\nvolatility. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially\na large portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts.

Purchase\nand Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other\nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation\nUnit transactions are conducted in exchange\nfor the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased\nand sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 19%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nMunicipal Yield Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, Nuveen Asset\nManagement, LLC\n(\u201cNuveen Asset\nManagement\u201d or the\n\u201cSub-Adviser\u201d), the\ninvestment sub-adviser\nto the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the Sub-\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nSub-Adviser determines\nhave economic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index.\nAdditionally, the Fund\nintends to invest,\nunder normal\ncircumstances, at\nleast 80% of its net\nassets, plus the\namount of borrowings\nfor investment\npurposes, in\ninvestments the income\nof which is exempt\nfrom Federal income\ntax. In addition, in\nseeking to 3 3 Table\nof Contents\n\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in\ndebt securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund). In seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Index is market\nvalue-weighted and\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of\nU.S. dollar-\ndenominated high-yield\nmunicipal bonds issued\nby U.S. states, the\nDistrict of Columbia,\nU.S. territories and\nlocal governments or\nagencies. The Index\nincludes fully tax-\nexempt investment\ngrade, non-investment\ngrade (\u201cjunk\u201d) and\nnon-rated bonds, but\ndoes not include\ndefaulted securities.\nBonds included in the\nIndex may include\nprivate activity\nbonds, which are\ntypically issued by or\non behalf of local or\nstate governments for\nthe purpose of\nfinancing the project\nof a private user. The\nIndex consists of\nbonds that are\nconstituents of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nMunicipal High Yield\nBond Index and\nBloomberg Barclays\nU.S. Municipal Bond\nIndex as follows: (i)\n70% of the Index is\nrepresented by the\nconstituents of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nMunicipal High Yield\nBond Index, the\nconstituents of which\nare non-rated or rated\nno higher than Ba1 by\nMoody's Investors\nService, Inc.\n(\u201cMoody's\u201d) or BB+ by\nStandard & Poor's\n(\u201cS&P\u201d) or Fitch Inc.\n(\u201cFitch\u201d); (ii) 20% of\nthe Index is\nrepresented by the\nconstituents of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nU.S. Municipal Bond\nIndex that are rated\nBaa3, Baa2, or Baa1 by\nMoody's or BBB-, BBB,\nor BBB+ by S&P or\nFitch; and (iii) 10%\nof the Index is\nrepresented by the\nconstituents of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nU.S. Municipal Bond\nIndex that are rated\nA3, A2, or A1 by\nMoody's or A-, A, or\nA+ by S&P or Fitch.\nConstituents of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nMunicipal High Yield\nBond Index must have a\ntotal amount\noutstanding of $3\nmillion or more and be\nissued as part of a\ntransaction of at\nleast $20 million.\nConstituents of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nU.S. Municipal Bond\nIndex must have a\ntotal amount\noutstanding of $7\nmillion or more and be\nissued as part of a\ntransaction of at\nleast $75 million.\nOnly fixed-rate coupon\nbonds (including zero\ncoupon bonds) with a\nremaining maturity of\nat least one year and\na dated date of\nJanuary 1, 1991 or\nlater are eligible for\ninclusion in the\nIndex. Securities\nincluded in the Index\nmay include when-\nissued securities, as\nwell as securities\nthat are subject to\nrestrictions on resale\nunder the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws\n(\u201crestricted\nsecurities\u201d). The\nsecurities in the\nIndex rebalance on the\nlast business day of\neach month. As of July\n31, 2020, there were\n20,024 securities in\nthe Index. The Index\nis sponsored by\nBloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund, the Adviser or\nthe Sub-Adviser. The\nIndex Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may\nincrease or decrease\nas a result of the\nfollowing: market\nfluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or\nilliquidity in debt\nsecurities markets;\nthe risk of low rates\nof return due to\nreinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling\ninterest rates. To the\nextent that interest\nrates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities to\ndecrease, an adverse\nimpact on the\nliquidity of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities, and\nincreased volatility\nof the fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment\nheightensthe risks\nassociated with rising\ninterest rates. During\nperiods when interest\nrates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and\nthe Fund may have a\nnegative yield (i.e.,\nit may lose moneyon an\noperating basis). If\nthe principal ona debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes\nin interest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values 3\n4 Table of Contents of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the\nreturns on other\ninvestment options,\nincluding investments\nin equity securities.\nBelow Investment-Grade\nSecurities Risk:\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities (\u201chigh\nyield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d\nbonds) are considered\npredominantly\nspeculative, and can\ninvolve a\nsubstantially greater\nrisk of default than\nhigher quality debt\nsecurities. Issuers of\nlower-quality debt\nsecurities may have\nsubstantially greater\nrisk of insolvency or\nbankruptcy than\nissuers of higher-\nquality debt\nsecurities. They can\nbe illiquid, and their\nvalues can have\nsignificant volatility\nand may decline\nsignificantly over\nshort periods of time.\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities tend to be\nmore sensitive to\nadverse news about the\nissuer, or the market\nor economy in general.\nMunicipal Obligations\nRisk: Issuers,\nincluding governmental\nissuers, may be unable\nto pay their\nobligations as they\ncome due. The values\nof municipal\nobligations may be\nadversely affected by\nlocal political and\neconomic conditions\nand developments. In\naddition, the values\nof municipal\nobligationsthat depend\non a specific revenue\nsource to fund their\npayment obligations\nmay fluctuate as a\nresult of actual or\nanticipated changes in\nthe cash flows\ngenerated by the\nrevenue source or\nchanges in the\npriority of the\nmunicipal obligation\nto receive the cash\nflows generated by the\nrevenue source.\nMunicipal obligations\nmay be more\nsusceptible to\ndowngrades or defaults\nduring recessions or\nsimilar periods of\neconomic stress.In\naddition, changes in\nfederal tax laws or\nthe activity of an\nissuer may adversely\naffect the tax-exempt\nstatus of municipal\nobligations. Loss of\ntax-exempt status may\ncause interest\nreceived and\ndistributed by the\nFund to shareholders\nto be taxable and may\nresult in a\nsignificant decline in\nthe values of such\nmunicipal obligations.\nPolitical Risk: A\nsignificant\nrestructuring of\nfederal income tax\nrates or even serious\ndiscussion on the\ntopic in Congress\ncould cause municipal\nbond prices to fall.\nThe demand for\nmunicipal securities\nis strongly influenced\nby the value of tax-\nexempt income to\ninvestors. Lower\nincome tax rates could\nreduce the advantage\nof owning municipals.\nPrivate Activity Bonds\nRisk: Private activity\nbonds are issued by or\non behalf of public\nauthorities to obtain\nfunds to provide\nprivately operated\nhousing facilities,\nairport, mass transit\nor port facilities,\nsewage disposal, solid\nwaste disposal or\nhazardous waste\ntreatment or disposal\nfacilities and certain\nlocal facilities for\nwater supply, gas or\nelectricity. Other\ntypes of private\nactivity bonds, the\nproceeds of which are\nused for the\nconstruction,\nequipment, repair or\nimprovement of\nprivately operated\nindustrial or\ncommercial facilities,\nmay constitute\nmunicipal securities,\nalthough the current\nfederal tax laws place\nlimitations on the\nsize of such issues.\nThe credit and quality\nof private activity\nbonds are usually\nrelated to the credit\nof the corporate user\nof the facilities.\nPayment of interest on\nand repayment of\nprincipal of such\nbonds are the\nresponsibility of the\ncorporate user (and/or\nany guarantor), which\nmeans that the holder\nof the private\nactivity bond is\nexposed to the risk\nthat the corporate\nuser (and/or any\nguarantor) may default\non the private\nactivity bond.\nConditions such as\nregulatory and\nenvironmental\nrestrictions and\neconomic downturns may\nlower the need for and\nthe ability of\ncorporate users to pay\nfor the projects\nfinanced by private\nactivity bonds. The\nFund's distributions\nof its interest income\nfrom private activity\nbonds may subject\ncertain investors to\nthe federal\nalternative minimum\ntax. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nIncome Risk: The\nFund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or\nother factors. Issuers\nof securities held by\nthe Fund may call or\nredeem the securities\nduring periods of\nfalling interest\nrates, and the Fund\nwould likely be\nrequired to reinvest\nin securities paying\nlower interest rates.\nIf an obligation held\nby the Fund is\nprepaid, the Fund may\nhave to reinvest the\nprepayment in other\nobligations paying\nincome at lower rates.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may 3 5 Table of\nContents be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Sub-Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e., achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Sub-Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nRestricted Securities\nRisk: The Fund may\nhold securities that\nhave not been\nregistered for sale to\nthe public under the\nU.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat a trading market\nwill exist at any time\nfor any particular\nrestricted security.\nLimitations on the\nresale of these\nsecurities may have an\nadverse effect on\ntheir marketability,\nand may prevent the\nFund from disposing of\nthem promptly at\nreasonable prices. The\nFund may have to bear\nthe expense of\nregistering the\nsecurities for resale\nand the risk of\nsubstantial delays in\neffecting the\nregistration. Also,\nrestricted securities\nmay be difficult to\nvalue because market\nquotations may not be\nreadily available, and\nthe securities may\nhave significant\nvolatility . Tax\nExemption Risk: There\nis no guarantee that\nthe Fund's income will\nbe exempt from federal\nor state income taxes.\nEvents occurring after\nthe date of issuance\nof a municipal bond or\nafter the Fund's\nacquisition of a\nmunicipal bond may\nresult in a\ndetermination that\ninterest on that bond\nis includible in gross\nincome for federal\nincome tax purposes\nretroactively to its\ndate of issuance. Such\na determination may\ncause a portion of\nprior distributions by\nthe Fund to its\nshareholders to be\ntaxable to those\nshareholders in the\nyear of receipt.\nFederal or state\nchanges in income or\nalternative minimum\ntax rates or in the\ntax treatment of\nmunicipal bonds may\nmake municipal bonds\nless attractive as\ninvestments and cause\nthem to decline in\nvalue. Valuation Risk:\nSome portfolio\nholdings, potentially\na large portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. When-Issued\nSecurities Risk: The\nFund may purchase\nsecurities on a when-\nissued or forward\ncommitment basis. The\npurchase price of such\nsecurities is\ntypically fixed at the\ntime of the\ncommitment, with\ndelivery and payment\ntaking place in the\nfuture. At the time of\ndelivery of the\nsecurities, the value\nmay be more or less\nthan the purchase or\nsale price. Purchase\nof securities on a\nwhen-issued or forward\ncommitment basis may\ngive rise to\ninvestment leverage,\nand may result in\nincreased volatility\nof the Fund's net\nasset value. Default\nby, or bankruptcy of,\na counterparty to a\nwhen-issued\ntransaction would\nexpose the Fund to\npossible losses\nbecause of an adverse\nmarket action,\nexpenses or delays in\nconnection with the\npurchase or sale of\nthe pools specified in\nsuch transaction.\nFinancial Industry\nRegulatory Authority,\nInc. rules impose\nmandatory margin\nrequirements for\ncertain types of when-\nissued or forward\ncommitment\ntransactions, with\nlimited exceptions.\nSuch transactions\nrequire mandatory\ncollateralization\nwhich may increase the\ncost of such\ntransactions and\nimpose added\noperational\ncomplexity. 3 6 Table\nof Contents\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 6.51% ( Q1,\n2014)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 5.80% ( Q2,\n2013)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was -1.03%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes. Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective October 1, 2019 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the S&P Municipal\nYield Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d)\nto the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Yield\nIndex, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index. Performance\nof the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index\nChange Date is therefore based on the Fund's\ninvestment strategy to track the Previous\nBenchmark Index.\n                                              \n             OneYear  FiveYears  Since        \n                                 Inception(\u2026  \n  Return                                      \n  Before     10.10%   4.69%      6.60%        \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return                                      \n  After      10.05%   4.66%      6.56%        \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribu\u2026                                   \n  Return                                      \n  After                                       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribu\u2026  7.67%    4.52%      6.21%        \n  and Sale                                    \n  of Fund                                     \n  Shares                                      \n  1          10.77%   5.77%      7.32%        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Barclays                                    \n  U.S.                                        \n  Aggregate                                   \n  Bond                                        \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects  8.72%    3.05%      3.48%        \n  no                                          \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses                                    \n  or                                          \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser and\nSub-Adviser SSGA Funds Management, Inc.

Creation\nUnit transactions may be conducted in exchange\nfor cash only, which may cause the Fund to\nrecognize capital gains and to pay out higher\nannual capital gain distributions to\nshareholders than if such transactions had\nbeen conducted in-kind. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund intends to pay income that is exempt\nfrom regular federal income tax, but which may\nbe subject to the federal alternative minimum\ntax (\u201cAMT\u201d). A portion of the Fund's\ndistributions may be subject to such taxes.\nIncome from municipal securities of states\nother than the shareholder's state of\nresidence generally will not qualify for tax-\nfree treatment for such shareholder with\nrespect to state and local taxes. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or\nvisit your financial intermediary's website\nfor more information. 3 8 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeNuveen Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond\nETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays          \n  Municipal Bond                              \n  ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide           \n  investment                                  \n  results that, before fees and expenses,     \n  correspond                                  \n  generally to the price and yield            \n  performance of an                           \n  index that tracks the U.S. municipal bond   \n  market                                      \n  and provides income that is exempt from     \n  federal                                     \n  income taxes.                               \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

(the         \n     \u201cAdviser\u201d) has contractually agreed to   \n     waive a portion of its management fee    \n     and reimburse certain expenses, until    \n     October 31, 2021, so that the net        \n     annual Fund operating expenses, before   \n     application of any fees and expenses     \n     not paid by the Adviser pursuant to the  \n     Investment Advisory Agreement, if any,   \n     are limited to 0.23% of the Fund's       \n     average daily net assets.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. The Example reflects the Fund's\ncontractual fee waiver and/or expense\nreimbursement only in the periods for which\nthe contractual fee waiver and/or expense\nreimbursement is expected to continue.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions your costs\nwould be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $24        $89    $162     $374  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 15%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nMunicipal Managed\nMoney 1-25 Years Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, Nuveen Asset\nManagement, LLC\n(\u201cNuveen Asset\nManagement\u201d or the\n\u201cSub-Adviser\u201d), the\ninvestment\n\n39\n\nTable of Contents sub-\nadviser to the Fund,\neither may invest the\nFund's assets in a\nsubset of securities\nin the Index or may\ninvest theFund's\nassets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the Sub-\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nSub-Adviser determines\nhave economic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index.\nAdditionally, the Fund\nintends to invest,\nunder normal\ncircumstances, at\nleast 80% of its net\nassets, plus the\namount of borrowings\nfor investment\npurposes, in\ninvestments the income\nof which is exempt\nfrom Federal income\ntax. In addition, in\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in debt\nsecurities that are\nnot included in the\nIndex, cash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund). In seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Index is designed\nto track the U.S.\nfully tax-exempt bond\nmarket. The Index\nincludes state and\nlocal general\nobligation bonds,\nrevenue bonds, pre-\nrefunded bonds, and\ninsured bonds. The\nIndex is comprised of\ntax-exempt municipal\nsecurities issued by\nstates, cities,\ncounties, districts\nand their respective\nagencies. A general\nobligation bond is\nsecured by the full\nfaith and credit of\nits issuer. A revenue\nbond is payable from a\nspecific source of\nrevenue. A pre-\nrefunded bond is a\nrevenue bond that the\nissuer has allocated\nfunds to fully retire.\nAn insured bond is\nprotected from issuer\ndefault or rating\ndowngrade by an\ninsurance company. The\nIndex also includes\nmunicipal lease\nobligations, which are\nsecurities issued by\nstate and local\ngovernments and\nauthorities to finance\nthe acquisition of\nequipment and\nfacilities. They may\ntake the form of a\nlease, an installment\npurchase contract, a\nconditional sales\ncontract, or a\nparticipation interest\nin a lease or\ncontract. The Index is\na rules-based, market-\nvalue weighted index\nengineered for the\ntax-exempt bond\nmarket. All bonds in\nthe Index must be U.S.\ndollar denominated and\nrated Aa3/AA- or\nhigher by at least two\nof the following\nstatistical ratings\nagencies: Moody's\nInvestors Service,\nInc., Standard &\nPoor's Financial\nServices LLC, and\nFitch Inc. If only two\nof the three agencies\nrate the security, the\nlower rating is used\nto determine index\neligibility. If only\none of the agencies\nrates the security,\nthe rating must be at\nleast Aa3/AA-. In\naddition, to be\nincluded in the Index,\na security must meet\nthe following\nrequirements: (i) must\nbe fixed rate; (ii)\nhave been issued\nwithin the last five\nyears; (iii) have an\noutstanding par value\nof at least $7 million\nand have been issued\nas part of a\ntransaction of at\nleast $75 million; and\n(iv) have a remaining\nmaturity of greater\nthan or equal to 1\nyear and less than 25\nyears. Securities\nincluded in the Index\nmay include when-\nissued securities.\nBonds subject to\nalternative minimum\ntax, hospital bonds,\nhousing bonds, tobacco\nbonds, and airline\nbonds are excluded\nfrom the Index. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nmonthly on the last\nbusiness day of the\nmonth. As of July 31,\n2020, there were\n21,039 securities in\nthe Index . The Index\nis sponsored by\nBloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund, the Adviser or\nthe Sub-Adviser. The\nIndex Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may\nincrease or decrease\nas a result of the\nfollowing: market\nfluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or\nilliquidity in debt\nsecurities markets;\nthe risk of low rates\nof return due to\nreinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling\ninterest rates. To the\nextent that interest\nrates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally 4 0\nTable of Contents\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities to\ndecrease, an adverse\nimpact on the\nliquidity of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities, and\nincreased volatility\nof the fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates\nare at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis).If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes\nin interest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values\nof debt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the\nreturns on other\ninvestment options,\nincluding investments\nin equity securities.\nMunicipal Obligations\nRisk: Issuers,\nincluding governmental\nissuers, may be unable\nto pay their\nobligations as they\ncome due. The values\nof municipal\nobligations may be\nadversely affected by\nlocal political and\neconomic conditions\nand developments. In\naddition, thevalues of\nmunicipal obligations\nthat depend on a\nspecific revenue\nsource to fund their\npayment obligations\nmay fluctuate as a\nresult of actual or\nanticipated changes in\nthe cash flows\ngenerated by the\nrevenue source or\nchanges in the\npriority of the\nmunicipal obligation\nto receive the cash\nflows generated by the\nrevenue source.\nMunicipal obligations\nmay be more\nsusceptible to\ndowngrades or defaults\nduring recessions or\nsimilar periods of\neconomic stress.In\naddition, changes in\nfederal tax laws or\nthe activity of an\nissuer may adversely\naffect the tax-exempt\nstatus of municipal\nobligations. Loss of\ntax-exempt status may\ncause interest\nreceived and\ndistributed by the\nFund to shareholders\nto be taxable and may\nresult in a\nsignificant decline in\nthe values of such\nmunicipal obligations.\nPolitical Risk: A\nsignificant\nrestructuring of\nfederal income tax\nrates or even serious\ndiscussion on the\ntopic in Congress\ncould cause municipal\nbond prices to fall.\nThe demand for\nmunicipal securities\nis strongly influenced\nby the value of tax-\nexempt income to\ninvestors. Lower\nincome tax rates could\nreduce the advantage\nof owning municipals.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nIncome Risk: The\nFund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or\nother factors. Issuers\nof securities held by\nthe Fund may call or\nredeem the securities\nduring periods of\nfalling interest\nrates, and the Fund\nwould likely be\nrequired to reinvest\nin securities paying\nlower interest rates.\nIf an obligation held\nby the Fund is\nprepaid, the Fund may\nhave to reinvest the\nprepayment in other\nobligations paying\nincome at lower rates.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Sub-Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Sub-Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex.\n\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the 4 1\nTable of Contents\nability of the Fund to\nobtain cash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitationson\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Tax\nExemption Risk: There\nis no guarantee that\nthe Fund's income will\nbe exempt from federal\nor state income taxes.\nEvents occurring after\nthe date of issuance\nof a municipal bond or\nafter the Fund's\nacquisition of a\nmunicipal bond may\nresult in a\ndetermination that\ninterest on that bond\nis includible in gross\nincome for federal\nincome tax purposes\nretroactively to its\ndate of issuance. Such\na determination may\ncause a portion of\nprior distributions by\nthe Fund to its\nshareholders to be\ntaxable to those\nshareholders in the\nyear of receipt.\nFederal or state\nchanges in income or\nalternative minimum\ntax rates or in the\ntax treatment of\nmunicipal bonds may\nmake municipal bonds\nless attractive as\ninvestments and cause\nthem to decline in\nvalue. Valuation Risk:\nSome portfolio\nholdings, potentially\na large portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. When-Issued\nSecurities Risk: The\nFund may purchase\nsecurities on a when-\nissued or forward\ncommitment basis. The\npurchase price of such\nsecurities is\ntypically fixed at the\ntime of the\ncommitment, with\ndelivery and payment\ntaking place in the\nfuture. At the time of\ndelivery of the\nsecurities, the value\nmay be more or less\nthan the purchase or\nsale price. Purchase\nof securities on a\nwhen-issued or forward\ncommitment basis may\ngive rise to\ninvestment leverage,\nand may result in\nincreased volatility\nof the Fund's net\nasset value. Default\nby, or bankruptcy of,\na counterparty to a\nwhen-issued\ntransaction would\nexpose the Fund to\npossible losses\nbecause of an adverse\nmarket action,\nexpenses or delays in\nconnection with the\npurchase or sale of\nthe pools specified in\nsuch transaction.\nFinancial Industry\nRegulatory Authority,\nInc. rules impose\nmandatory margin\nrequirements for\ncertain types of when-\nissued or forward\ncommitment\ntransactions, with\nlimited exceptions.\nSuch transactions\nrequire mandatory\ncollateralization\nwhich may increase the\ncost of such\ntransactions and\nimpose added\noperational\ncomplexity.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\nEffective January 2, 2019 (the \u201cBenchmark\nIndex Change Date\u201d), the Fund's benchmark\nindex changed from the Bloomberg Barclays\nMunicipal Managed Money Index (the \u201cPrevious\nBenchmark Index\u201d) to the Bloomberg Barclays\nMunicipal Managed Money 1-25 Years Index,\nconsistent with a change in the 4 2 Table of\nContents Fund's principal investment strategy\nto track the performance of the current\nindex.Performance of the Fund prior to the\nBenchmark Index Change Date is therefore based\non the Fund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index.\n                                              \n                OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return        7.53%    3.30%      4.10%     \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      7.53%    3.28%      4.03%     \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  5.38%    3.04%      3.80%     \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  1             7.83%    3.62%      4.39%     \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Barclays                                    \n  U.S.                                        \n  Aggregate                                   \n  Bond Index    8.72%    3.05%      3.75%     \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser and\nSub-Adviser SSGA Funds Management, Inc.

Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Creation\nUnit transactions may be conducted in exchange\nfor cash only, which may cause the Fund to\nrecognize capital gains and to pay out higher\nannual capital gain distributions to\nshareholders than if such transactions had\nbeen conducted in-kind. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\n\nThe Fund intends to pay income that is exempt\nfrom regular federal income tax, but which may\nbe subject to the federal alternative minimum\ntax (\u201cAMT\u201d). A portion of the Fund's\ndistributions may be subject to such taxes.\nIncome from municipal securities of states\nother than the shareholder's state of\nresidence generally will not qualify for tax-\nfree treatment for such shareholder with\nrespect to state and local taxes. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to 4 3 Table of\nContents the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the broker-dealer or\nother intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.\nAsk your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 4\n4 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeNuveen Bloomberg Barclays Short Term\nMunicipal Bond ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Short    \n  Term                                        \n  Municipal Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to    \n  provide                                     \n  investment results that, before fees and    \n  expenses,                                   \n  correspond generally to the price and       \n  yield                                       \n  performance of an index that tracks the     \n  short term                                  \n  tax exempt municipal bond market and        \n  provides                                    \n  income that is exempt from federal income   \n  taxes.                                      \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 23%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nManaged Money\nMunicipal Short Term\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, Nuveen Asset\nManagement, LLC\n(\u201cNuveen Asset\nManagement\u201d or the\n\u201cSub-Adviser\u201d), the\ninvestment sub-adviser\nto the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the Sub-\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective.\n\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nSub-Adviser determines\nhave economic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index.\nAdditionally, the Fund\nintends to invest,\nunder normal\ncircumstances, at\nleast 80% of its net\nassets, plus the\namount of borrowings\nfor investment\npurposes, in\ninvestments the income\nof which is exempt\nfrom Federal income\ntax.In addition, in\nseeking to 4 5 Table\nof Contents track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in debt\nsecurities that are\nnot included in the\nIndex, cash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund). In seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Index is designed\nto track the publicly\ntraded municipal bonds\nthat cover the U.S.\ndollar denominated\nshort term tax exempt\nbond market, including\nstate and local\ngeneral obligation\nbonds, revenue bonds,\npre-refunded bonds,\nand insured bonds. A\ngeneral obligation\nbond is secured by the\nfull faith and credit\nof its issuer. A\nrevenue bond is\npayable from a\nspecific source of\nrevenue. A pre-\nrefunded bond is a\nrevenue bond that the\nissuer has allocated\nfunds to fully retire.\nAn insured bond is\nprotected from issuer\ndefault or rating\ndowngrade by an\ninsurance company. The\nIndex is a rules-\nbased, market-value\nweighted index. All\nbonds in the Index\nmust be rated Aa3/AA-\nor higher by at least\ntwo of the following\nstatistical ratings\nagencies: Moody's\nInvestors Service,\nInc., Standard &\nPoor's Financial\nServices, LLC or Fitch\nInc. If only two of\nthe three agencies\nrate the security, the\nlower rating is used\nto determine index\neligibility. If only\none of the agencies\nrates the security,\nthe rating must be at\nleast Aa3/AA-. Each\nIndex security must\nhave an outstanding\npar value of at least\n$7 million and be\nissued as part of a\ntransaction of at\nleast $75 million. The\nbonds must be fixed\nrate and have a\nnominal maturity of\none to five years. No\nissuer may constitute\nmore than 10% of the\nIndex. Securities\nincluded in the Index\nmay include when-\nissued securities.\nBonds subject to\nalternative minimum\ntax, hospital bonds,\nhousing bonds, tobacco\nbonds, and airline\nbonds, along with\nremarketed issues,\ntaxable municipal\nbonds, floaters, and\nderivatives are all\nexcluded from the\nIndex. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 4,148\nsecurities in the\nIndex andthe dollar-\nweighted average\nmaturity of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex was 3.06 years.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby Bloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund, the Adviser or\nthe Sub-Adviser. The\nIndex Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may\nincrease or decrease\nas a result of the\nfollowing: market\nfluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or\nilliquidity in debt\nsecurities markets;\nthe risk of low rates\nof return due to\nreinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling\ninterest rates. To the\nextent that interest\nrates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities to\ndecrease, an adverse\nimpact on the\nliquidity of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities, and\nincreased volatility\nof the fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates\nare at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis).If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes\nin interest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values\nof debt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the\nreturns on other\ninvestment options,\nincluding investments\nin equity securities.\nMunicipal Obligations\nRisk: Issuers,\nincluding governmental\nissuers, may be unable\nto pay their\nobligations as they\ncome due. The values\nof municipal\nobligations may be\nadversely affected by\nlocal political and\neconomic conditions\nand developments. In\naddition, the values\nof municipal\nobligations that\ndepend on a specific\nrevenue source to fund\ntheir payment\nobligations may\nfluctuate as a result\nof actual or\nanticipated changes in\nthe cash 4 6 Table of\nContents flows\ngenerated by the\nrevenue source or\nchanges in the\npriority of the\nmunicipal obligation\nto receive the cash\nflows generated by the\nrevenue source.\nMunicipal obligations\nmay be more\nsusceptible to\ndowngrades or defaults\nduring recessions or\nsimilar periods of\neconomic stress. In\naddition, changes in\nfederal tax laws or\nthe activity of an\nissuer may adversely\naffect the tax-exempt\nstatus of municipal\nobligations. Loss of\ntax-exempt status may\ncause interest\nreceived and\ndistributed by the\nFund to shareholders\nto be taxable and may\nresult in a\nsignificant decline in\nthe values of such\nmunicipal obligations.\nPolitical Risk: A\nsignificant\nrestructuring of\nfederal income tax\nrates or even serious\ndiscussion on the\ntopic in Congress\ncould cause municipal\nbond prices to fall.\nThe demand for\nmunicipal securities\nis strongly influenced\nby the value of tax-\nexempt income to\ninvestors. Lower\nincome tax rates could\nreduce the advantage\nof owning municipals.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nIncome Risk: The\nFund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or\nother factors. Issuers\nof securities held by\nthe Fund may call or\nredeem the securities\nduring periods of\nfalling interest\nrates, and the Fund\nwould likely be\nrequired to reinvest\nin securities paying\nlower interest rates.\nIf an obligation held\nby the Fund is\nprepaid, the Fund may\nhave to reinvest the\nprepayment in other\nobligations paying\nincome at lower rates.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Sub-Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Sub-Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Low\nShort-Term Interest\nRates Risk: During\nmarket conditions in\nwhich short-term\ninterest rates are at\nlow levels, the Fund's\nyield can be very low,\nand the Fund may have\na negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). During these\nconditions, it is\npossible that the Fund\nwill generate an\ninsufficient amount of\nincome to pay its\nexpenses, and will not\nbe able to pay its\nscheduled dividend. In\naddition, it is\npossible that during\nthese conditions the\nFund may experience\ndifficulties\npurchasing and/or\nselling securities\nwith respect to\nscheduled rebalances,\nand may, as a result,\nmaintain a portion of\nits assets in cash, on\nwhich it may earn\nlittle, if any,\nincome. Such market\nconditions may\nadversely affect the\nFund's ability to\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with\nthe Index. Tax\nExemption Risk: There\nis no guarantee that\nthe Fund's income will\nbe exempt from federal\nor state income taxes.\nEvents occurring after\nthe date of issuance\nof a municipal bond or\nafter the Fund's\nacquisition of a\nmunicipal bond may\nresult in a\ndetermination that\ninterest on that bond\nis includible in gross\nincome for federal 4 7\nTable of Contents\n\nincome tax purposes\nretroactively to its\ndate of issuance. Such\na determination may\ncause a portion of\nprior distributions by\nthe Fund to its\nshareholders to be\ntaxable to those\nshareholders in the\nyear of receipt.\nFederal orstate\nchanges in income or\nalternative minimum\ntax rates or in the\ntax treatment of\nmunicipal bonds may\nmake municipal bonds\nless attractive as\ninvestments and cause\nthem to decline in\nvalue. Valuation Risk:\nSome portfolio\nholdings, potentially\na large portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. When-Issued\nSecurities Risk: The\nFund may purchase\nsecurities on a when-\nissued or forward\ncommitment basis. The\npurchase price of such\nsecurities is\ntypically fixed at the\ntime of the\ncommitment, with\ndelivery and payment\ntaking place in the\nfuture. At the time of\ndelivery of the\nsecurities, the value\nmay be more or less\nthan the purchase or\nsale price. Purchase\nof securities on a\nwhen-issued or forward\ncommitment basis may\ngive rise to\ninvestment leverage,\nand may result in\nincreased volatility\nof the Fund's net\nasset value. Default\nby, or bankruptcy of,\na counterparty to a\nwhen-issued\ntransaction would\nexpose the Fund to\npossible losses\nbecause of an adverse\nmarket action,\nexpenses or delays in\nconnection with the\npurchase or sale of\nthe pools specified in\nsuch transaction.\nFinancial Industry\nRegulatory Authority,\nInc. rules impose\nmandatory margin\nrequirements for\ncertain types of when-\nissued or forward\ncommitment\ntransactions, with\nlimited exceptions.\nSuch transactions\nrequire mandatory\ncollateralization\nwhich may increase the\ncost of such\ntransactions and\nimpose added\noperational\ncomplexity.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

To the extent\nthat a reference in this Prospectus refers to\nthe Adviser, with respect to the Fund, such\nreference should also be read to refer to\nNuveen Asset Management, where the context\nrequires. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Timothy Ryan and\nSteven Hlavin. Timothy T. Ryan, CFA, is a\nManaging Director and Portfolio Manager at\nNuveen Asset Management. Mr. Ryan joined an\naffiliate of Nuveen Asset Management in 2010.\nSteven M. Hlavin is a Managing Director and\nPortfolio Manager at Nuveen Asset Management.\nMr. Hlavin joined an affiliate of Nuveen Asset\nManagement in 2003. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Creation\nUnit transactions may be conducted in exchange\nfor cash only, which may cause the Fund to\nrecognize capital gains and to pay out higher\nannual capital gain distributions to\nshareholders than if such transactions had\nbeen conducted in-kind. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund intends to pay income that is exempt\nfrom regular federal income tax, but which may\nbe subject to the federal alternative minimum\ntax (\u201cAMT\u201d). A portion of the Fund's\ndistributions may be subject to such taxes.\nIncome from municipal securities of states\nother than the shareholder's state of\nresidence generally will not qualify for tax-\nfree treatment for such shareholder with\nrespect to state and local taxes. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $4         $13     $23      $51  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 101% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays U.S.\nAggregate Bond Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. TBA\nTransactions (as\ndefined below) are\nincluded within the\nabove-noted investment\npolicy. In addition, in\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of 5\n0\n\nTable of Contents\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Fund may use\nderivatives, including\ncredit default swaps\nand credit default\nindex swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure\nthat the Adviser\nexpects to correlate\nclosely with the Index,\nor a portion of the\nIndex, and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\nU.S. dollar denominated\ninvestment grade bond\nmarket, which includes\ninvestment grade (must\nbe Baa3/BBB- or higher\nusing the middle rating\nof Moody's Investors\nService, Inc., Standard\n& Poor's Financial\nServices, LLC, and\nFitch Inc.) government\nbonds, investment grade\ncorporate bonds,\nmortgage pass through\nsecurities, commercial\nmortgage backed\nsecurities and other\nasset backed securities\nthat are publicly for\nsale in the United\nStates. The securities\nin the Index must have\nat least 1 year\nremaining to maturity\nand must have $300\nmillion or more of\noutstanding face value.\nAsset backed securities\nmust have a minimum\ndeal size of $500\nmillion and a minimum\ntranche size of $25\nmillion. For commercial\nmortgage backed\nsecurities, the\noriginal aggregate\ntransaction must have a\nminimum deal size of\n$500 million, and a\nminimum tranche size of\n$25 million; the\naggregate outstanding\ntransaction sizes must\nbe at least $300\nmillion to remain in\nthe Index. In addition,\nthe securities must be\nU.S. dollar\ndenominated, fixed\nrate, non-convertible,\nand taxable. Certain\ntypes of securities,\nsuch as flower bonds,\ntargeted investor\nnotes, and state and\nlocal government series\nbonds are excluded from\nthe Index. Also\nexcluded from the Index\nare structured notes\nwith embedded swaps or\nother special features,\nprivate placements,\nfloating rate\nsecurities and\nEurobonds. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and the\nsecurities in the Index\nare updated on the last\nbusiness day of each\nmonth. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 11,780\nsecurities in the Index\n. As of July 31, 2020,\napproximately 26.40% of\nthe bonds represented\nin the Index were U.S.\nagency mortgage pass-\nthrough securities.\nU.S. agency mortgage\npass-through securities\nare securities issued\nby entities such as\nGovernment National\nMortgage Association\n(\u201cGNMA\u201d) and Federal\nNational Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFNMA\u201d)\nthat are backed by\npools of mortgages.\nMost transactions in\nmortgage pass-through\nsecurities occur\nthrough standardized\ncontracts for future\ndelivery in which the\nexact mortgage pools to\nbe delivered are not\nspecified until a few\ndays prior to\nsettlement, referred to\nas a \u201cto-be-announced\ntransaction\u201d or \u201cTBA\nTransaction.\u201d In a TBA\nTransaction, the buyer\nand seller agree upon\ngeneral trade\nparameters such as\nagency, settlement\ndate, par amount and\nprice. The actual pools\ndelivered generally are\ndetermined two days\nprior to the settlement\ndate; however, it is\nnot anticipated that\nthe Fund will receive\npools, but instead will\nparticipate in rolling\nTBA Transactions. The\nFund expects to enter\ninto such contracts on\na regular basis. The\nFund, pending\nsettlement of such\ncontracts, will invest\nits assets in high-\nquality, liquid short\nterm instruments,\nincluding shares of\naffiliated money market\nfunds. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment\nheightensthe risks\nassociated with rising\ninterest rates. During\nperiods when interest\nrates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and\nthe Fund may have a\nnegative yield (i.e.,\nit may lose moneyon an\noperating basis). If\nthe principal on a debt\nobligati on is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may 5 1 Table\nof Contents have to be\nreinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or redeem\nthe securities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Money\nMarket Risk: An\ninvestment in a money\nmarket fund is not a\ndeposit of any bank and\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the FDIC\nor any other government\nagency. Certain money\nmarket funds seek to\npreserve the value of\ntheir shares at $1.00\nper share, although\nthere can be no\nassurance that they\nwill do so, and it is\npossible to lose money\nby investing in such a\nmoney market fund. A\nmajor or unexpected\nchange in interest\nrates or a decline in\nthe credit quality of\nan issuer or entity\nproviding credit\nsupport, an inactive\ntrading market for\nmoney market 5 2 Table\nof Contents\ninstruments, or adverse\nmarket, economic,\nindustry, political,\nregulatory,\ngeopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause\nthe share price of such\na money market fund to\nfall below $1.00. Other\nmoney market funds\nprice and transact at a\n\u201cfloating\u201d NAV that\nwill fluctuate along\nwith changes in the\nmarket-based value of\nfund assets. Shares\nsold utilizing a\nfloating NAV may be\nworth more or less than\ntheir original purchase\nprice. Recent changes\nin the regulation of\nmoney market funds may\naffect the operations\nand structures of money\nmarket funds. Mortgage-\nRelated and Other\nAsset-Backed Securities\nRisk: Investments in\nmortgage-related and\nother asset-backed\nsecurities are subject\nto the risk of\nsignificant credit\ndowngrades,\nilliquidity, and\ndefaults to a greater\nextent than many other\ntypes of fixed-income\ninvestments. The\nliquidity of mortgage-\nrelated and asset-\nbacked securities may\nchange over time.\nDuring periods of\nfalling interest rates,\nmortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities may\nbe called or prepaid,\nwhich may result in the\nFund having to reinvest\nproceeds in other\ninvestments at a lower\ninterest rate. During\nperiods of rising\ninterest rates, the\naverage life of\nmortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities may\nextend, which may lock\nin a below-market\ninterest rate, increase\nthe security's duration\nand interest rate\nsensitivity, and reduce\nthe value of the\nsecurity. Enforcing\nrights against the\nunderlying assets or\ncollateral may be\ndifficult, and the\nunderlying assets or\ncollateral may be\ninsufficient if the\nissuer defaults. U.S.\nGovernment Securities\nRisk: Certain U.S.\ngovernment securities\nare supported by the\nfull faith and credit\nof the United States;\nothers are supported by\nthe right of the issuer\nto borrow from the U.S.\nTreasury; others are\nsupported by the\ndiscretionary authority\nof the U.S. government\nto purchase the\nagency's obligations;\nand still others are\nsupported only by the\ncredit of the issuing\nagency,\ninstrumentality, or\nenterprise. Although\nU.S. government-\nsponsored enterprises\nsuch as the Federal\nHome Loan Mortgage\nCorporation (\u201cFreddie\nMac\u201d) and the Federal\nNational Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie\nMae\u201d) may be chartered\nor sponsored by\nCongress, they are not\nfunded by Congressional\nappropriations, and\ntheir securities are\nnot issued by the U.S.\nTreasury, are not\nsupported by the full\nfaith and credit of the\nU.S. government, and\ninvolve increased\ncredit risks. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations. This\nmay occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil\nor reduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. When-Issued, TBA\nand Delayed Delivery\nSecurities Risk: The\nFund may purchase\nsecurities on a when-\nissued, to-be-announced\n(\u201cTBA\u201d) or delayed\ndelivery basis and may\npurchase securities on\na forward commitment\nbasis. The purchase\nprice of the securities\nis typically fixed at\nthe time of the\ncommitment, but\ndelivery and payment\ncan take place a month\nor more after the date\nof the commitment. At\nthe time of delivery of\nthe securities, the\nvalue may be more or\nless than the purchase\nor sale price. Purchase\nof securities on a\nwhen-issued, TBA,\ndelayed delivery, or\nforward commitment\nbasis may give rise to\ninvestment leverage,\nand may result in\nincreased volatility of\nthe Fund's net asset\nvalue. Default by, or\nbankruptcy of, a\ncounterparty to a when-\nissued, TBA or delayed\ndelivery transaction\nwould expose the Fund\nto possible losses\nbecause of an adverse\nmarket action, expenses\nor delays in connection\nwith the purchase or\nsale of the pools\nspecified in such\ntransaction. Financial\nIndustry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. rules\nimpose mandatory margin\nrequirements for\ncertain types of when-\nissued, TBA delayed\ndelivery or forward\ncommitment\ntransactions, with\nlimited exceptions.\nSuch transactions\nrequire mandatory\ncollateralization which\nmay increase the cost\nof such transactions\nand impose added\noperational complexity.\n5 3 Table of Contents\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Michael Przygoda, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. He joined the Adviser in 2006. Purchase\nand Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other\nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation\nUnit transactions are conducted in exchange\nfor the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased\nand sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. 5 4 Table of\nContents Tax Information\n\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $6         $19     $34      $77  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 24% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays U.S.\nCorporate Bond Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\n\n5 6 Table of Contents\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Fund may use\nderivatives, including\ncredit default swaps\nand credit default\nindex swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure\nthat the Adviser\nexpects to correlate\nclosely with the Index,\nor a portion of the\nIndex, and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\ninvestment grade\ncorporate bond market.\nThe Index includes\npublicly issued,\ninvestment grade,\nfixed-rate, taxable,\nU.S. dollar-denominated\ncorporate bonds issued\nby U.S. and non-U.S.\nindustrial, utility,\nand financial\ninstitutions. Bonds\nincluded in the Index\nmust have $300 million\nor more of par amount\noutstanding and a\nremaining maturity of\nat least 1 year. The\nIndex considers\ninvestment grade\nsecurities to be rated\nBaa3/BBB- or higher,\nusing the middle rating\nof Moody's Investors\nService, Inc., Fitch\nInc., or Standard &\nPoor's Financial\nServices, LLC. If only\ntwo of the three\nagencies rate the\nsecurity, then the more\nconservative (lower)\nrating will be used to\ndetermine Index\neligibility. If only\none of the agencies\nrates the security,\nthen that rating will\nbe used. SEC-registered\nsecurities, bonds\nexempt from\nregistration at the\ntime of issuance and\nSEC Rule 144A\nsecurities with\nregistration rights are\neligible for inclusion.\nThe Index is rebalanced\nmonthly on the last\nbusiness day of the\nmonth. As of June 30,\n2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe financial and\nconsumer\ncyclicalsectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 6,534\nsecurities in the Index\n. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis).If the principal\non a debt obligation is\nprepaid before\nexpected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. 5 7 Table of\nContents Consumer\nCyclicalSector Risk:\nCompanies in the\nconsumer cyclical\nsector are largely\nimpacted bythe\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\nchanges ininterest\nrates, fluctuations in\nsupply and demand,and\nchanges inconsumer\npreferences. Success\ndepends heavily on\ndisposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. As a result,\nconsumer\ncyclicalcompanies may\nbe adversely affected\nand lose value quickly\nin periods of economic\ndownturns. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or redeem\nthe securities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 5 8 Table of\nContents Liquidity\nRisk: Lack of a ready\nmarket or restrictions\non resale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S.\nentity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security and\nthe last quoted price\nfor the underlying\nsecurity on the closed\nforeign market. These\ndeviations could result\nin the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities\ntraded on foreign\nmarkets may be less\nliquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital\nto the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent\nthat the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated\nin a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks\nsuch as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates\nand the risk that a\nforeign government\ncould regulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant impact\non the Fund. Certain\ncountries have recently\nexperienced (or\ncurrently are expected\nto experience) negative\ninterest rates on\ncertain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar\ninterest rate\nconditions may be\nexperienced in other\nregions. Investments in\nfixed-income securities\nwith very low or\nnegative interest rates\nmay magnify the Fund's\nsusceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and\nperformance, and such\ninvestments may be\nsubject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced\nliquidity. Restricted\nSecurities Risk: The\nFund may hold\nsecurities that have\nnot been registered for\nsale to the public\nunder the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat a trading market\nwill exist at any time\nfor any particular\nrestricted security.\nLimitations on the\nresale of these\nsecurities may have an\nadverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may\nprevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them\npromptly at reasonable\nprices. The Fund may\nhave to bear the\nexpense of registering\nthe securities for\nresale and the risk of\nsubstantial delays in\neffecting the\nregistration. Also,\nrestricted securities\nmay be difficult to\nvalue because market\nquotations may not be\nreadily available, and\nthe securities may have\nsignificant volatility.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. 59 Table of\nContents\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective July 31, 2018 (the \u201cBenchmark\nIndex Change Date\u201d), the Fund's benchmark\nindex changed from the Bloomberg Barclays\nIssuer Scored Corporate Index (the \u201cPrevious\nBenchmark Index\u201d) to the Bloomberg Barclays\nU.S. Corporate Bond Index, consistent with a\nchange in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of the\ncurrent index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same.

These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 53%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the ICE\nBofA US High Yield\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines\nhave economic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\ndebt securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\n62\n\nTable of Contents\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Fund may use\nderivatives, including\ncredit default swaps\nand credit default\nindex swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure\nthat the Adviser\nexpects to correlate\nclosely with the\nIndex, or a portion of\nthe Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows.\nThe Index is designed\nto measure the\nperformance of U.S.\ndollar denominated\nbelow investment grade\n(commonly referred to\nas \u201cjunk\u201d) corporate\ndebt publicly issued\nin the U.S. domestic\nmarket. The Index\nincludes securities\nrated below investment\ngrade (based on an\naverage of Moody's\nInvestors Service,\nInc., Fitch, Inc., and\nStandard & Poor's\nFinancial Services,\nLLC) with at least 18\nmonths remaining to\nfinal maturity at the\ntime of issuance and\nat least one year\nremaining term to\nfinal maturity as of\nthe Index's\nrebalancing date. In\naddition, individual\nsecurities of\nqualifying issuers\nmust have a fixed\ncoupon schedule and a\nminimum amount\noutstanding of $250\nmillion. Qualifying\ncorporate issuers must\nhave risk exposure to\nan FX-G10 or Western\nEuropean country, or a\nterritory of the\nUnited States or a\nWestern European\ncountry. As of July\n31, 2020, the FX-G10\nincludes all Eurozone\nmembers, the United\nStates, Japan, the\nUnited Kingdom,\nCanada, Australia, New\nZealand, Switzerland,\nNorway and Sweden.\nSecurities included in\nthe Index may include\nsecurities that are\nsubject to\nrestrictions on resale\nunder the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws\n(\u201crestricted\nsecurities\u201d). The\nIndex is market\ncapitalization\nweighted, and is\nrebalanced on the last\ncalendar day of the\nmonth based on\ninformation available\nup to and including\nthe third business day\nbefore the last\nbusiness day of the\nmonth. As of June 30,\n2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe consumer cyclical,\nconsumer non-\ncyclicaland\ncommunication services\nsectors, although this\nmay change from time\nto time. As of July\n31, 2020, there were\napproximately 1,975\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by ICE Data\nIndices, LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may\nincrease or decrease\nas a result of the\nfollowing: market\nfluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or\nilliquidity in debt\nsecurities markets;\nthe risk of low rates\nof return due to\nreinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling\ninterest rates. To the\nextent that interest\nrates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities to\ndecrease, an adverse\nimpact on the\nliquidity of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities, and\nincreased volatility\nof the fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates\nare at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis).If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes\nin interest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values\nof debt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the\nreturns on other\ninvestment options,\nincluding investments\nin equity securities.\nBelow Investment-Grade\nSecurities Risk:\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities (\u201chigh\nyield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d\nbonds) are considered\npredominantly\nspeculative, and can\ninvolve a\nsubstantially greater\nrisk of default than\nhigher quality debt\nsecurities. Issuers of\nlower-quality debt\nsecurities may have\nsubstantially greater\nrisk of insolvency or\n6 3 Table of Contents\nbankruptcy than\nissuers of higher-\nquality debt\nsecurities. They can\nbe illiquid, and their\nvalues can have\nsignificant volatility\nand may decline\nsignificantly over\nshort periods of time.\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities tend to be\nmore sensitive to\nadverse news about the\nissuer, or the market\nor economy in general.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCommunication Services\nSector Risk:\nCommunication services\ncompanies are\nparticularly\nvulnerable to the\npotential obsolescence\nof products and\nservices due to\ntechnological\nadvancement and the\ninnovation of\ncompetitors. Companies\nin the communication\nservices sector may\nalso be affected by\nother competitive\npressures, such as\npricing competition,\nas well as research\nand development costs,\nsubstantial capital\nrequirements and\ngovernment regulation.\nAdditionally,\nfluctuating domestic\nand international\ndemand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes\nin consumer tastes can\ndrastically affect a\ncommunication services\ncompany's\nprofitability. While\nall companies may be\nsusceptible to network\nsecurity breaches,\ncertain companies in\nthe communication\nservices sector may be\nparticular targets of\nhacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary\nor consumer\ninformation or\ndisruptions in\nservice, which could\nhave a material\nadverse effect on\ntheir businesses.\nConsumer Cyclical\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the consumer\ncyclical sector are\nlargely impacted by\nthe performance of the\noverall global\neconomy, changes in\ninterest rates,\nfluctuations in supply\nand demand, and\nchanges in consumer\npreferences. Success\ndepends heavily on\ndisposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. As a result,\nconsumer cyclical\ncompanies may be\nadversely affected and\nlose value quickly in\nperiods of economic\ndownturns. Consumer\nNon-Cyclical Sector\nRisk: Investments in\nthe consumer non-\ncyclical sector\ninvolve risks\nassociated with\ncompanies that\nmanufacture products\nand provide\ndiscretionary services\ndirectly to the\nconsumer. Performance\nof companies in the\nconsumer non-cyclical\nsector may be\nadversely impacted by\nfluctuations in supply\nand demand, changes in\nthe global economy,\nconsumer spending,\ncompetition,\ndemographics and\nconsumer preferences,\nand production\nspending. Companies in\nthe consumer non-\ncyclical sector are\nalso affected by\nchanges in government\nregulation, global\neconomic,\nenvironmental and\npolitical events, and\neconomic conditions.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser.\nGeographic Focus Risk:\nThe performance of a\nfund that is less\ndiversified across\ncountries or\ngeographic regions\nwill be closely tied\nto market, currency,\neconomic, political,\nenvironmental, or\nregulatory conditions\nand developments in\nthe countries or\nregions in which the\nfund invests, and may\nbe more volatile than\nthe performance of a\nmore geographically-\ndiversified fund.\nEurope: Developed and\nemerging market\ncountries in Europe\nwill be significantly\naffected by the fiscal\nand monetary controls\nof the Economic and\nMonetary Union of the\nEuropean Union (\u201cEU\u201d).\nChanges in regulations\non trade, decreasing\nimports or exports,\nchanges in the\nexchange rate of the\neuro and recessions\namong European\ncountries may have a\nsignificant adverse\neffect on the\neconomies of other\nEuropean countries. In\naddition, one or more\ncountries may abandon\nthe euro and/or\nwithdraw from the EU.\nFor example, in June\n2016, citizens of the\nUnited Kingdom voted\nin a referendum to\nleave the EU (known as\n\u201cBrexit\u201d), creating\neconomic and political\nuncertainty in its\nwake. In March 2017,\nthe United Kingdom\nformally notified 6 4\nTable of Contents the\nEuropean Council of\nthe United Kingdom's\nintention to withdraw\nfrom the EU pursuant\nto Article 50 of the\nTreaty on European\nUnion. This formal\nnotification began a\nmulti-year period of\nnegotiations regarding\nthe terms of the\nUnited Kingdom's exit\nfrom the EU, which\nformally occurred on\nJanuary 31, 2020. The\nU.K. is currently in a\ntransition period\nwhere it remains\nsubject to EU rules\nbut has no role in the\nEU law-making process.\nDuring this transition\nperiod, United Kingdom\nand EU representatives\nare negotiating the\nprecise terms of their\nfuture relationship.\nThe transition period\nis scheduled to end on\nDecember 31, 2020. The\nfull scope and nature\nof the consequences of\nthe exit are not at\nthis time known and\nare unlikely to be\nknown for a\nsignificant period of\ntime. It is also\nunknown whether the\nUnited Kingdom's exit\nwill increase the\nlikelihood of other\ncountries also\ndeparting the EU. Any\nexits from the EU, or\nthe possibility of\nsuch exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global\neconomies, which may\nresult in increased\nvolatility and\nilliquidity, new legal\nand regulatory\nuncertainties and\npotentially lower\neconomic growth for\nsuch economies that\ncould potentially have\nan adverse effect on\nthe value of the\nFund's investments. In\naddition, a number of\ncountries in Europe\nhave suffered\nterrorist attacks and\nadditional attacks may\noccur in the future.\nSuch attacks may cause\nuncertainty in\nfinancial markets and\nmay adversely affect\nthe performance of the\nissuers to which the\nFund has exposure.\nIncome Risk: The\nFund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or\nother factors. Issuers\nof securities held by\nthe Fund may call or\nredeem the securities\nduring periods of\nfalling interest\nrates, and the Fund\nwould likely be\nrequired to reinvest\nin securities paying\nlower interest rates.\nIf an obligation held\nby the Fund is\nprepaid, the Fund may\nhave to reinvest the\nprepayment in other\nobligations paying\nincome at lower rates.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector .\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities 6 5\nTable of Contents\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nCertain countries have\nrecently experienced\n(or currently are\nexpected to\nexperience) negative\ninterest rates on\ncertain fixed-income\nsecurities, and\nsimilar interest rate\nconditions may be\nexperienced in other\nregions. Investments\nin fixed-income\nsecurities with very\nlow or negative\ninterest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's\nsusceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and\nperformance, and such\ninvestments may be\nsubject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced\nliquidity. Restricted\nSecurities Risk: The\nFund may hold\nsecurities that have\nnot been registered\nfor sale to the public\nunder the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat a trading market\nwill exist at any time\nfor any particular\nrestricted security.\nLimitations on the\nresale of these\nsecurities may have an\nadverse effect on\ntheir marketability,\nand may prevent the\nFund from disposing of\nthem promptly at\nreasonable prices. The\nFund may have to bear\nthe expense of\nregistering the\nsecurities for resale\nand the risk of\nsubstantial delays in\neffecting the\nregistration. Also,\nrestricted securities\nmay be difficult to\nvalue because market\nquotations may not be\nreadily available, and\nthe securities may\nhave significant\nvolatility.\n\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 6.23% ( Q1,\n2019)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 3.06% ( Q2,\n2013)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was -0.22%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes. Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\nEffective April 1, 2019 (the \u201cBenchmark Index\nChange Date\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index\nchanged from the ICE BofAML US Diversified\nCrossover Corporate Index (the \u201cPrevious\nBenchmark Index\u201d) to the ICE BofA US High\nYield Index (formerly known as ICE BofAML US\nHigh Yield Index), consistent with a 66 Table\nof Contents change in the Fund's principal\ninvestment strategy to track the performance\nof the current index.

Purchase\nand Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other\nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation\nUnit transactions are conducted in exchange\nfor the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased\nand sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or\nvisit your financial intermediary's website\nfor more information. 6 7\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aePortfolio Intermediate Term Corporate\nBond ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term        \n  Corporate                                   \n  Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide      \n  investment                                  \n  results that, before fees and expenses,     \n  correspond                                  \n  generally to the price and yield            \n  performance of an                           \n  index that tracks the intermediate term     \n  (1-10                                       \n  years) sector of the United States          \n  corporate bond                              \n  market.                                     \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $7         $23     $40      $90  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 35% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays U.S.\nIntermediate Corporate\nBond Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\n\n6 8 Table of Contents\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Fund may use\nderivatives, including\ncredit default swaps\nand credit default\nindex swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure\nthat the Adviser\nexpects to correlate\nclosely with the Index,\nor a portion of the\nIndex, and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of U.S.\ncorporate bonds that\nhave a maturity of\ngreater than or equal\nto 1 year and less than\n10 years. The Index is\na component of the\nBloomberg Barclays U.S.\nCorporate Index and\nincludes investment\ngrade, fixed-rate,\ntaxable, U.S. dollar\ndenominated debt with\n$300 million or more of\npar amount outstanding,\nissued by U.S. and\nnon-U.S. industrial,\nutility, and financial\ninstitutions.\nSubordinated issues,\nsecurities with normal\ncall and put provisions\nand sinking funds,\nmedium-term notes (if\nthey are publicly\nunderwritten), 144A\nsecurities with\nregistration rights,\nand global issues that\nare SEC-registered are\nincluded. Structured\nnotes with embedded\nswaps or other special\nfeatures, as well as\nprivate placements,\nfloating- rate\nsecurities, and\nEurobonds are excluded\nfrom the Index. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nmonthly, on the last\nbusiness day of the\nmonth. As of June 30,\n2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe financial and\nconsumer\ncyclicalsectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 4,188\nsecurities in the Index\nand thedollar-weighted\naverage maturity of the\nsecurities in the Index\nwas 5.25 years. The\nIndex is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis).If the principal\non a debt obligation is\nprepaid before\nexpected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. 69 Table of\nContents\n\nConsumer Cyclical\nSector Risk: Co mpanies\nin the consumer\ncyclical sector are\nlargely impacted by the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\nchanges in interest\nrates, fluctuations in\nsupply and demand, and\nchanges in consumer\npreferences. Success\ndepends heavily on\ndisposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. As a result,\nconsumer cyclical\ncompanies may be\nadversely affected and\nlose value quickly in\nperiods of economic\ndownturns .\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to\nthecounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or redeem\nthe securities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 7 0\n\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S.\nentity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security and\nthe last quoted price\nfor the underlying\nsecurity on the closed\nforeign market. These\ndeviations could result\nin the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities\ntraded on foreign\nmarkets may be less\nliquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital\nto the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent\nthat the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated\nin a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks\nsuch as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates\nand the risk that a\nforeign government\ncould regulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant impact\non the Fund. Certain\ncountries have recently\nexperienced (or\ncurrently are expected\nto experience) negative\ninterest rates on\ncertain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar\ninterest rate\nconditions may be\nexperienced in other\nregions. Investments in\nfixed-income securities\nwith very low or\nnegative interest rates\nmay magnify the Fund's\nsusceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and\nperformance, and such\ninvestments may be\nsubject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced\nliquidity. Restricted\nSecurities Risk: The\nFund may hold\nsecurities that have\nnot been registered for\nsale to the public\nunder the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat a trading market\nwill exist at any time\nfor any particular\nrestricted security.\nLimitations on the\nresale of these\nsecurities may have an\nadverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may\nprevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them\npromptly at reasonable\nprices. The Fund may\nhave to bear the\nexpense of registering\nthe securities for\nresale and the risk of\nsubstantial delays in\neffecting the\nregistration. Also,\nrestricted securities\nmay be difficult to\nvalue because market\nquotations may not be\nreadily available, and\nthe securities may have\nsignificant volatility.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. 7 1\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective December 17, 2010 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Barclays\nCapital U.S. Intermediate Credit Index (the\n\u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the Bloomberg\nBarclays U.S. Intermediate Corporate Bond\nIndex, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $6         $19     $34      $77  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 22% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays 3-10\nYear U.S. Treasury\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). The Index is\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of\nintermediate term (3-10\nyears) public\nobligations of the U.S.\nTreasury. The Index\nincludes all publicly\nissued U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that have a\nremaining maturity of\ngreater than\n\n7 4\n\nTable of Contents or\nequal to 3 years and\nless than 10 years, are\nrated investment grade\nand have $300 million\nor more of outstanding\nface value. In\naddition, the\nsecurities must be\ndenominated in U.S.\ndollars, fixed rate and\nnon-convertible.\nSecurities excluded\nfrom the Index include\nstate and local\ngovernment series\nbonds, inflation\nprotected public\nobligations of the U.S.\nTreasury, commonly\nknown as \u201cTIPS,\u201d\nfloating rate bonds and\ncoupon issues that have\nbeen stripped from\nbonds included in the\nIndex. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and the\nsecurities in the Index\nare updated on the last\nbusiness day of each\nmonth. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 113\nsecurities in the Index\nandthe dollar-weighted\naverage maturity of the\nsecurities in the Index\nwas 5.57 years. The\nIndex is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchangesin interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis).If the principal\non a debt obligation is\nprepaid before\nexpected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations\nRisk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ\nfrom other fixed income\nsecurities in their\ninterest rates,\nmaturities, times of\nissuance and other\ncharacteristics.\nSimilar to other\nissuers, changes to the\nfinancial condition or\ncredit rating of the\nU.S. government may\ncause the value of the\nFund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or redeem\nthe securities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. 7 5 Table of\nContents Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e.,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nSecurities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may\nengage in securities\nlending. Securities\nlending involves the\nrisk that the borrower\nof the loaned\nsecurities fails to\nreturn the securities\nin a timely manner or\nat all. The Fund could\nalso lose money due to\na decline in the value\nof collateral provided\nfor loaned securities\nor any investments made\nwith cash collateral.\nThese events could also\ntrigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the\nFund. To the extent the\ncollateral provided or\ninvestments made with\ncash collateral differ\nfrom securities\nincluded in the Index,\nsuch collateral or\ninvestments may have a\ngreater risk of loss\nthan the securities\nincluded in the Index.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Your actual after-tax returns\nwill depend on your specific tax situation and\nmay differ from those shown below. After-tax\nreturns are not relevant to investors who hold\nFund Shares through tax-advantaged\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before\ntaxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a\nshareholder from realizing a capital loss on a\nsale of Fund Shares.Effective April 30, 2018\n(the \u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the\nFund's benchmark index changed from the\nBloomberg Barclays Intermediate U.S. Treasury\nIndex (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the\nBloomberg Barclays 3-10 Year U.S. Treasury\nIndex, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Joanna Madden,\nCynthia Moy and Orhan Imer. Joanna Madden is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. She joined the Adviser in 2003. Cynthia\nMoy is a Principal of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n2007. Orhan Imer, CFA, Ph.D., is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs.\n\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or\ncapital gains, unless you are investing\nthrough a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as\na 401(k) plan or individual retirement\naccount. Any withdrawals made from such tax-\nadvantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\n7 7 Table of Contents Payments to Broker-\nDealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If\nyou purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such\nas a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 7\n8 Table of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aePortfolio Long Term Corporate Bond ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Portfolio Long Term Corporate      \n  Bond ETF                                    \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment    \n  results                                     \n  that, before fees and expenses, correspond  \n  generally to the price and yield            \n  performance of an                           \n  index that tracks the long term (10+        \n  years) sector                               \n  of the United States corporate bond         \n  market.                                     \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $7         $23     $40      $90  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 22%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nU.S. Long Term\nCorporate Bond Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines\nhave economic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\ndebt securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalen tsor\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets will generally\nbe concentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\n\n79 Table of Contents\nThe Index is designed\nto measure the\nperformance of U.S.\ncorporate bonds that\nhave a maturity of\ngreater than or equal\nto 10 years. The Index\nis a component of the\nBloomberg Barclays\nU.S. Corporate Index\nand includes\ninvestment grade,\nfixed-rate, taxable,\nU.S. dollar-\ndenominated debt with\n$300 million or more\nof par amount\noutstanding, issued by\nU.S. and non-U.S.\nindustrial, utility,\nand financial\ninstitutions.\nSubordinated issues,\nsecurities with normal\ncall and put\nprovisions and sinking\nfunds, medium-term\nnotes (if they are\npublicly\nunderwritten), 144A\nsecurities with\nregistration rights,\nand global issues that\nare SEC-registered are\nincluded. Structured\nnotes with embedded\nswaps or other special\nfeatures, as well as\nprivate placements,\nfloating-rate\nsecurities, and\nEurobonds are excluded\nfrom the Index. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nmonthly, on the last\nbusiness day of the\nmonth. As of June 30,\n2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe financial and\nconsumer\ncyclicalsectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 2,346\nsecurities in the\nIndex and the dollar-\nweighted average\nmaturity of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex was 23.70 years.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby Bloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may\nincrease or decrease\nas a result of the\nfollowing: market\nfluctuations, changes\nin interest rates,\nactual or perceived\ninability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or\nilliquidity in debt\nsecurities markets;\nthe risk of low rates\nof return due to\nreinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling\ninterest rates. To the\nextent that interest\nrates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities to\ndecrease, an adverse\nimpact on the\nliquidity of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities, and\nincreased volatility\nof the fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates\nare at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes\nin interest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values\nof debt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the\nreturns on other\ninvestment options,\nincluding investments\nin equity securities.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConsumer Cyclical\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the consumer\ncyclical sector are\nlargely impacted by\nthe performance of the\noverall global\neconomy, changes in\ninterest rates,\nfluctuations in supply\nand demand, and\nchanges in consumer\npreferences. Success\ndepends heavily on\ndisposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. As a result,\nconsumer cyclical\ncompanies may be\nadversely affected and\nlose value quickly in\nperiods of economic\ndownturns. 8 0 Table\nof Contents Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or\nother factors. Issuers\nof securities held by\nthe Fund may call or\nredeem the securities\nduring periods of\nfalling interest\nrates, and the Fund\nwould likely be\nrequired to reinvest\nin securities paying\nlower interest rates.\nIf an obligation held\nby the Fund is\nprepaid, the Fund may\nhave to reinvest the\nprepayment in other\nobligations paying\nincome at lower rates.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npote ntially\nincreasing the risk of\ndivergence between the\nFund's return and that\nof the Index.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose 8 1 Table\nof Contents\n\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nCertain countries have\nrecently experienced\n(or currently are\nexpected to\nexperience) negative\ninterest rates on\ncertain fixed-income\nsecurities, and\nsimilar interest rate\nconditions may be\nexperienced in other\nregions. Investments\nin fixed-income\nsecurities with very\nlow or negative\ninterest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's\nsusceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and\nperformance, and such\ninvestments may be\nsubject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced\nliquidity. Restricted\nSecurities Risk: The\nFund may hold\nsecurities that have\nnot been registered\nfor sale to the public\nunder the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat a trading market\nwill exist at any time\nfor any particular\nrestricted security.\nLimitations on the\nresale of these\nsecurities may have an\nadverse effect on\ntheir marketability,\nand may prevent the\nFund from disposing of\nthem promptly at\nreasonable prices. The\nFund may have to bear\nthe expense of\nregistering the\nsecurities for resale\nand the risk of\nsubstantial delays in\neffecting the\nregistration. Also,\nrestricted securities\nmay be difficult to\nvalue because market\nquotations may not be\nreadily available, and\nthe securities may\nhave significant\nvolatility. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially\na large portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors whohold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\nEffective December 17, 2010 (the \u201cBenchmark\nIndex Change Date\u201d), the Fund's benchmark\nindex changed from the Barclays Capital U.S.\nLong Credit Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark\nIndex\u201d) to the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Long\nTerm Corporate Bond Index, consistent with a\nchange in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of the\ncurrent index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $6         $19     $34      $77  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 12% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays Long\nU.S. Treasury Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective . Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). The Index is\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of public\nobligations of the U.S.\nTreasury that have a\nremaining maturity of\n10 years or more. The\nIndex includes all\npublicly issued, U.S.\nTreasury securities\nthat have a remaining\n\n8 4\n\nTable of Contents\nmaturity of 10 years or\nmore, are rated\ninvestment grade, and\nhave $300 million or\nmore of outstanding\nface value. In\naddition, the\nsecurities must be\ndenominated in U.S.\ndollars and must be\nfixed rate and non-\nconvertible. Excluded\nfrom the Index are\ncertain special issues,\nsuch as flower bonds,\ntargeted investor\nnotes, state and local\ngovernment series\nbonds, inflation\nprotected public\nobligations of the U.S.\nTreasury, commonly\nknown as \u201cTIPS,\u201d and\ncoupon issues that have\nbeen stripped from\nbonds included in the\nIndex. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and the\nsecurities in the Index\nare updated on the last\nbusiness day of each\nmonth. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 53\nsecurities in the Index\nand the dollar-weighted\naverage maturity of the\nsecurities in the Index\nwas 24.93 years. The\nIndex is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex . Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestmen ts. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchanges in interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations\nRisk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ\nfrom other fixed income\nsecurities in their\ninterest rates,\nmaturities, times of\nissuance and other\ncharacteristics.\nSimilar to other\nissuers, changes to the\nfinancial condition or\ncredit rating of the\nU.S. government may\ncause the value of the\nFund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange -traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or redeem\nthe securities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. 8 5 Table of\nContents Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions . The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nSecurities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may\nengage in securities\nlending. Securities\nlending involves the\nrisk that the borrower\nof the loaned\nsecurities fails to\nreturn the securities\nin a timely manner or\nat all. The Fund could\nalso lose money due to\na decline in the value\nof collateral provided\nfor loaned securities\nor any investments made\nwith cash collateral.\nThese events could also\ntrigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the\nFund. To the extent the\ncollateral provided or\ninvestments made with\ncash collateral differ\nfrom securities\nincluded in the Index,\nsuch collateral or\ninvestments may have a\ngreater risk of loss\nthan the securities\nincluded in the Index.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Joanna Madden,\nCynthia Moy and Orhan Imer. Joanna Madden is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. She joined the Adviser in 2003. Cynthia\nMoy is a Principal of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n2007. Orhan Imer, CFA, Ph.D., is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you.\n\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 298% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays U.S.\nMBS Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement,\n\n88\n\nTable of Contents Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. TBA\nTransactions (as\ndefined below) are\nincluded within the\nabove-noted investment\npolicy. In addition, in\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Index is designed\nto measure the\nperformance of the U.S.\nagency mortgage pass-\nthrough segment of the\nU.S. investment grade\nbond market. The term\n\u201cU.S. agency mortgage\npass-through security\u201d\nrefers to a category of\npass-through securities\nbacked by pools of\nmortgages and issued by\none of the following\nU.S. government-\nsponsored enterprises:\nGovernment National\nMortgage Association\n(\u201cGNMA\u201d); Federal\nNational Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFNMA\u201d)\nand Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Corporation\n(\u201cFHLMC\u201d). The Index is\nformed by grouping the\nuniverse of individual\nfixed rate mortgage\nbacked securities pools\ninto generic aggregates\naccording to the\nfollowing parameters:\n(i) agency; (ii)\nprogram; (iii) pass-\nthrough coupon; and\n(iv) origination year.\nIndex maturity and\nliquidity criteria are\nthen applied to these\naggregates to determine\nwhich qualify for\ninclusion in the Index.\nTo be included in the\nIndex, securities must\nbe fixed rate,\ndenominated in U.S.\ndollars, and be part of\na cohort that has $1\nbillion or more of\noutstanding face value\nand have a weighted\naverage maturity of at\nleast one year.\nExcluded from the Index\nare buydowns, graduated\nequity mortgages,\nproject loans,\nmanufactured homes\n(dropped in January\n1992), graduated\npayment mortgages\n(dropped in January\n1995), non-agency\n(whole loan)\nsecurities, jumbo\nsecurities,\ncollateralized mortgage\nobligations, and hybrid\nadjustable-rate\nmortgages. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and the\nsecurities in the Index\nare updated on the last\ncalendar day of each\nmonth. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 460\nsecurities in the Index\n. Most transactions in\nmortgage pass-through\nsecurities occur\nthrough standardized\ncontracts for future\ndelivery in which the\nexact mortgage pools to\nbe delivered are not\nspecified until a few\ndays prior to\nsettlement, referred to\nas a \u201cto-be announced\ntransaction\u201d or \u201cTBA\nTransaction.\u201d In a TBA\nTransaction, the buyer\nand seller agree upon\ngeneral trade\nparameters such as\nagency, settlement\ndate, par amount and\nprice. The actual pools\ndelivered generally are\ndetermined two days\nprior to the settlement\ndate. The Fund expects\nto enter into such\ncontracts on a regular\nbasis, and pending\nsettlement of such\ncontracts, the Fund\nwill invest its assets\nin liquid, short-term\ninstruments, including\nshares of money market\nfunds advised by the\nAdviser or its\naffiliates. The Index\nis sponsored by\nBloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex . Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchanges in interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally 89\nTable of Contents\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities . Mortgage-\nRelated and Other\nAsset-Backed Securities\nRisk: Investments in\nmortgage-related and\nother asset-backed\nsecurities are subject\nto the risk of\nsignificant credit\ndowngrades,\nilliquidity, and\ndefaults to a greater\nextent than many other\ntypes of fixed-income\ninvestments. The\nliquidity of mortgage-\nrelated and asset-\nbacked securities may\nchange over time.\nDuring periods of\nfalling interest rates,\nmortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities may\nbe called or prepaid,\nwhich may result in the\nFund having to reinvest\nproceeds in other\ninvestments at a lower\ninterest rate. During\nperiods of rising\ninterest rates, the\naverage life of\nmortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities may\nextend, which may lock\nin a below-market\ninterest rate, increase\nthe security's duration\nand interest rate\nsensitivity, and reduce\nthe value of the\nsecurity. Enforcing\nrights against the\nunderlying assets or\ncollateral may be\ndifficult, and the\nunderlying assets or\ncollateral may be\ninsufficient if the\nissuer defaults.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Cash\nTransaction Risk: The\nFund may sell portfolio\nsecurities to meet some\nor all of a redemption\nrequest with cash. In\nsuch cases, the Fund\nmay incur taxable gains\nor losses that it might\nnot have incurred had\nit made redemptions\nentirely in-kind. As a\nresult, the Fund may\npay out higher annual\ncapital gain\ndistributions than if\nthe in-kind redemption\nprocess was used.\nIncome Risk: The Fund's\nincome may decline due\nto falling interest\nrates or other factors.\nIssuers of securities\nheld by the Fund may\ncall or redeem the\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations 9 0\nTable of Contents on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nPortfolio Turnover\nRisk: Frequent\npurchases and sales of\nportfolio securities\nmay result in higher\nFund expenses and may\nresult in more\nsignificant\ndistributions of short-\nterm capital gains to\ninvestors, which are\ntaxed to individuals as\nordinary income. U.S.\nGovernment Securities\nRisk: Certain U.S.\ngovernment securities\nare supported by the\nfull faith and credit\nof the United States;\nothers are supported by\nthe right of the issuer\nto borrow from the U.S.\nTreasury; others are\nsupported by the\ndiscretionary authority\nof the U.S. government\nto purchase the\nagency's obligations;\nand still others are\nsupported only by the\ncredit of the issuing\nagency,\ninstrumentality, or\nenterprise. Although\nU.S. government-\nsponsored enterprises\nsuch as the Federal\nHome Loan Mortgage\nCorporation (\u201cFreddie\nMac\u201d) and the Federal\nNational Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie\nMae\u201d) may be chartered\nor sponsored by\nCongress, they are not\nfunded by Congressional\nappropriations, and\ntheir securities are\nnot issued by the U.S.\nTreasury, are not\nsupported by the full\nfaith and credit of the\nU.S. government, and\ninvolve increased\ncredit risks. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations. This\nmay occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil\nor reduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. When-Issued, TBA\nand Delayed Delivery\nSecurities Risk: The\nFund may purchase\nsecurities on a when-\nissued, to-be-announced\n(\u201cTBA\u201d) or delayed\ndelivery basis and may\npurchase securities on\na forward commitment\nbasis. The purchase\nprice of the securities\nis typically fixed at\nthe time of the\ncommitment, but\ndelivery and payment\ncan take place a month\nor more after the date\nof the commitment. At\nthe time of delivery of\nthe securities, the\nvalue may be more or\nless than the purchase\nor sale price. Purchase\nof securities on a\nwhen-issued, TBA,\ndelayed delivery, or\nforward commitment\nbasis may give rise to\ninvestment leverage,\nand may result in\nincreased volatility of\nthe Fund's net asset\nvalue. Default by, or\nbankruptcy of, a\ncounterparty to a when-\nissued, TBA or delayed\ndelivery transaction\nwould expose the Fund\nto possible losses\nbecause of an adverse\nmarket action, expenses\nor delays in connection\nwith the purchase or\nsale of the pools\nspecified in such\ntransaction. Financial\nIndustry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. rules\nimpose mandatory margin\nrequirements for\ncertain types of when-\nissued, TBA delayed\ndelivery or forward\ncommitment\ntransactions, with\nlimited exceptions.\nSuch transactions\nrequire mandatory\ncollateralization which\nmay increase the cost\nof such transactions\nand impose added\noperational complexity.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals    \nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day      \nmanagement of the Fund are Marc DiCosimo and  \nMichael Przygoda. Marc DiCosimo, CFA, is a    \nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior    \nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta    \nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in     \n2013. Michael Przygoda, CFA, is a Vice        \nPresident of the Adviser and a Portfolio      \nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions    \nGroup. He joined the Adviser in 2006. Purchase\nand Sale Information The Fund will issue (or  \nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional  \ninvestors (typically market makers or other   \nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund  \nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation    \nUnit transactions are conducted in exchange   \nfor the deposit or delivery of a designated   \nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.  \nCreation Unit transactions may be conducted in\nexchange for cash only, which may cause the   \nFund to recognize capital gains and to pay out\nhigher annual capital gain distributions to   \nshareholders than if such transactions had    \nbeen conducted in-kind. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE    \nArca, Inc., other national securities         \nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and   \nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund  \nShares trade at market prices rather than at  \nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less \nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling   \nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may  \nincur costs attributable to the difference    \nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing  \nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the  \nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).     \nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,  \nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at                   \nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information   \nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be   \ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-       \nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan \nor individual retirement account. Any         \nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged     \narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial            \nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares    \nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial    \nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or \nits affiliates may pay the financial          \nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training      \nprograms, conferences, the development of     \ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or         \npromotion of the Fund. These payments may     \ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing  \nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and   \nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over   \nanother investment.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $7         $23     $40      $90  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 54% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays U.S.\n1-3 Year Corporate Bond\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney marketfunds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets will\ngenerally be\nconcentrated in an 9 3\nTable of Contents\n\nindustry or group of\nindustries to the\nextent that the Index\nconcentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nThe Fund may use\nderivatives, including\ncredit default swaps\nand credit default\nindex swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure\nthat the Adviser\nexpects to correlate\nclosely with the Index,\nor a portion of the\nIndex, and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\nshort term U.S.\ncorporate bond market.\nThe Index includes\npublicly issued U.S.\ndollar denominated\ncorporate issues that\nhave a remaining\nmaturity of greater\nthan or equal to 1 year\nand less than 3 years,\nare rated investment\ngrade (must be\nBaa3/BBB- or higher\nusing the middle rating\nof Moody's Investors\nService, Inc., Fitch\nInc., or Standard &\nPoor's Financial\nServices, LLC), and\nhave $300 million or\nmore of outstanding\nface value. In\naddition, the\nsecurities must be\ndenominated in U.S.\ndollars, fixed rate and\nnon-convertible. The\nIndex includes only\ncorporate sectors. The\ncorporate sectors are\nIndustrial, Utility,\nand Financial\nInstitutions, which\ninclude both U.S. and\nnon-U.S. corporations.\nThe following\ninstruments are\nexcluded from the\nIndex: structured notes\nwith embedded swaps or\nother special features;\nprivate placements;\nfloating rate\nsecurities; and\nEurobonds. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and the\nsecurities in the Index\nare updated on the last\nbusiness day of each\nmonth. As of June 30,\n2020, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe financial and\nconsumer\ncyclicalsectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 1,160\nsecurities in the Index\nand the dollar-weighted\naverage maturity of the\nsecurities in the Index\nwas 2.06 years. The\nIndex is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchanges in interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. 9 4 Table of\nContents Consumer\nCyclical Sector Risk:\nCompanies in the\nconsumer cyclical\nsector are largely\nimpacted by the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\nchanges in interest\nrates, fluctuations in\nsupply and demand, and\nchanges in consumer\npreferences. Success\ndepends heavily on\ndisposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. As a result,\nconsumer cyclical\ncompanies may be\nadversely affected and\nlose value quickly in\nperiods of economic\ndownturns .\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or redeem\nthe securities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 9 5 Table of\nContents Liquidity\nRisk: Lack of a ready\nmarket or restrictions\non resale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S.\nentity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their securities\nmay be subject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security and\nthe last quoted price\nfor the underlying\nsecurity on the closed\nforeign market. These\ndeviations could result\nin the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities\ntraded on foreign\nmarkets may be less\nliquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital\nto the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent\nthat the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated\nin a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks\nsuch as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates\nand the risk that a\nforeign government\ncould regulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant impact\non the Fund. Certain\ncountries have recently\nexperienced (or\ncurrently are expected\nto experience) negative\ninterest rates on\ncertain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar\ninterest rate\nconditions may be\nexperienced in other\nregions. Investments in\nfixed-income securities\nwith very low or\nnegative interest rates\nmay magnify the Fund's\nsusceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and\nperformance, and such\ninvestments may be\nsubject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced\nliquidity. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations. This\nmay occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil\nor reduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past performance\n(before and after\ntaxes) is not\nnecessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance information\nis available by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/sp\ndrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 1.86% ( Q3,\n2010)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 0.56% ( Q3,\n2011)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 3.16%.           \n                                              \n  Average Annual Total Returns (for periods   \n    ended 12/31/19) The after-tax returns     \n presented in the table below are calculated  \n using highest historical individual federal  \n marginal income tax rates and do not reflect \n  the impact of state and local taxes.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondarymarket, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs.\n\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or\ncapital gains, unless you are investing\nthrough a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as\na 401(k) plan or individual retirement\naccount. Any withdrawals made from such tax-\nadvantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.06%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.06%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $6         $19     $34      $77  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 55% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays 1-3\nYear U.S. Treasury\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). The Index is\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of short\nterm (1-3 years) public\nobligations of the U.S.\nTreasury. The Index\nincludes all publicly\nissued U.S. Treasury\nsecurities that have a\nremaining maturity of\ngreater than or equal\n\n98\n\nTable of Contents to 1\nyear and less than 3\nyears, are rated\ninvestment grade and\nhave $300 million or\nmore of outstanding\nface value. In\naddition, the\nsecurities must be\ndenominated in U.S.\ndollars, fixed rate and\nnon-convertible.\nSecurities excluded\nfrom the Index include\nstate and local\ngovernment series\nbonds, inflation\nprotected public\nobligations of the U.S.\nTreasury, commonly\nknown as \u201cTIPS,\u201d\nfloating rate bonds and\ncoupon issues that have\nbeen stripped from\nbonds included in the\nIndex. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and the\nsecurities in the Index\nare updated on the last\nbusiness day of each\nmonth. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 94\nsecurities in the Index\nand the dollar-weighted\naverage maturity of the\nsecurities in the Index\nwas 1.96 years. The\nIndex is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities m ay\nincrease or decrease as\na result of the\nfollowing: market\nfluctuations, changes\nin interest rates,\nactual or perceived\ninability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations\nRisk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ\nfrom other fixed income\nsecurities in their\ninterest rates,\nmaturities, times of\nissuance and other\ncharacteristics.\nSimilar to other\nissuers, changes to the\nfinancial condition or\ncredit rating of the\nU.S. government may\ncause the value of the\nFund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the\nFund may call or redeem\nthe securities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. 99 Table of\nContents Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund,\nwhichtypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e.,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nSecurities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may\nengage in securities\nlending. Securities\nlending involves the\nrisk that the borrower\nof the loaned\nsecurities fails to\nreturn the securities\nin a timely manner or\nat all. The Fund could\nalso lose money due to\na decline in the value\nof collateral provided\nfor loaned securities\nor any investments made\nwith cash collateral.\nThese events could also\ntrigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the\nFund. To the extent the\ncollateral provided or\ninvestments made with\ncash collateral differ\nfrom securities\nincluded in the Index,\nsuch collateral or\ninvestments may have a\ngreater risk of loss\nthan the securities\nincluded in the Index.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past performance\n(before and after\ntaxes) is not\nnecessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance information\nis available by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/sp\ndrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 1.54% ( Q1,\n2016)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 1.20% ( Q4,\n2016)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2020, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 3.12%.           \n                                              \n10 0 Table of Contents Average Annual Total\nReturns (for periods ended 12/31/19) The\nafter-tax returns presented in the table below\nare calculated using highest historical\nindividual federal marginal income tax rates\nand do not reflect the impact of state and\nlocal taxes. Your actual after-tax returns\nwill depend on your specific tax situation and\nmay differ from those shown below. After-tax\nreturns are not relevant to investors who hold\nFund Shares through tax-advantaged\narrangements, such as 401(k) plans or\nindividual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before\ntaxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a\nshareholder from realizing a capital loss on a\nsale of Fund Shares.Effective April 30, 2018\n(the \u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the\nFund's benchmark index changed from the\nBloomberg Barclays 1-5 Year U.S. Treasury\nIndex (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the\nBloomberg Barclays 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury\nIndex, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index. Performance\nof the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index\nChange Date is therefore based on the Fund's\ninvestment strategy to track the Previous\nBenchmark Index.\n                                              \n              OneYear  FiveYears  Since       \n                                  Inception\u2026  \n  Return                                      \n  Before      3.54%    1.38%      1.07%       \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return                                      \n  After       2.60%    0.77%      0.62%       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribut\u2026                                  \n  Return                                      \n  After                                       \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distribut\u2026  2.09%    0.79%      0.62%       \n  and Sale                                    \n  of Fund                                     \n  Shares                                      \n  1           3.59%    1.46%      1.16%       \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  Barclays                                    \n  U.S.                                        \n  Aggregate                                   \n  Bond Index                                  \n  (reflects   8.72%    3.05%      3.01%       \n  no                                          \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses                                    \n  or                                          \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account.

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 16% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nBloomberg Barclays U.S.\nGovernment Inflation-\nLinked Bond Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index and in\nsecurities that the\nAdviser determines have\neconomic\ncharacteristics that\nare substantially\nidentical to the\neconomic\ncharacteristics of the\nsecurities that\ncomprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser).\n\n10 3\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is designed to\nmeasure the performance\nof the inflation\nprotected public\nobligations of the U.S.\nTreasury, commonly\nknown as \u201cTIPS.\u201d TIPS\nare securities issued\nby the U.S. Treasury\nthat are designed to\nprovide inflation\nprotection to\ninvestors. The Index\nincludes publicly\nissued TIPS that have\nat least 1 year\nremaining to maturity\non the Index\nrebalancing date, with\nan issue size equal to\nor in excess of $500\nmillion. Bonds must be\ncapital-indexed and\nlinked to an eligible\ninflation index. The\nsecurities must be\ndenominated in U.S.\ndollars and pay coupon\nand principal in U.S.\ndollars. The notional\ncoupon of a bond must\nbe fixed or zero. Bonds\nmust settle on or\nbefore the Index\nrebalancing date. The\nsecurities in the Index\nare updated on the last\nbusiness day of each\nmonth. As of July 31,\n2020, there were 42\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may increase\nor decrease as a result\nof the following:\nmarket fluctuations,\nchanges in interest\nrates, actual or\nperceived inability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or illiquidity\nin debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of\nlow rates of return due\nto reinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling interest\nrates. To the extent\nthat interest rates\nrise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities\nto decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and\nincreased volatility of\nthe fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are\nat low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values of\ndebt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the returns\non other investment\noptions, including\ninvestments in equity\nsecurities. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations\nRisk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ\nfrom other fixed income\nsecurities in their\ninterest rates,\nmaturities, times of\nissuance and other\ncharacteristics.\nSimilar to other\nissuers, changes to the\nfinancial condition or\ncredit rating of the\nU.S. government may\ncause the value of the\nFund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline.\nInflation-Indexed\nSecurities Risk: The\nprincipal amount of an\ninflation-indexed\nsecurity typically\nincreases with\ninflation and decreases\nwith deflation, as\nmeasured by a specified\nindex. It is possible\nthat, in a period of\ndeclining inflation\nrates, the Fund could\nreceive at maturity\nless than the initial\nprincipal amount of an\ninflation-indexed\nsecurity. Changes in\nthe values of\ninflation-indexed\nsecurities may be\ndifficult to predict,\nand it is possible that\nan investment in such\nsecurities will have an\neffect different from\nthat anticipated.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. 1 0 4 Table\nof Contents Income\nRisk: The Fund's income\nmay decline due to\nfalling interest rates\nor other factors.\nIssuers of securities\nheld by the Fund may\ncall or redeem the\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates, and the\nFund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an\nobligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment\nin other obligations\npaying income at lower\nrates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrackthe Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market\nor restrictions on\nresale may limit the\nability of the Fund to\nsell a security at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities may\ntrade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on\na timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nSecurities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may\nengage in securities\nlending. Securities\nlending involves the\nrisk that the borrower\nof the loaned\nsecurities fails to\nreturn the securities\nin a timely manner or\nat all. The Fund could\nalso lose money due to\na decline in the value\nof collateral provided\nfor loaned securities\nor any investments made\nwith cash collateral.\nThese events could also\ntrigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the\nFund. To the extent the\ncollateral provided or\ninvestments made with\ncash collateral differ\nfrom securities\nincluded in the Index,\nsuch collateral or\ninvestments may have a\ngreater risk of loss\nthan the securities\nincluded in the Index.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. 1 0 5 Table of\nContents\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund  \nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain \ninstitutional investors (typically market     \nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large \nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation      \nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are        \nconducted in exchange for the deposit or      \ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind \nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE    \nArca, Inc., other national securities         \nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and   \nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund  \nShares trade at market prices rather than at  \nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less \nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling   \nFund Shares in the secondary 10 6 Table of    \nContents market, you may incur costs          \nattributable to the difference between the    \nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to    \npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest     \nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund  \nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent   \ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market  \nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask    \nspreads is available at                       \nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information   \nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be   \ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-       \nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan \nor individual retirement account. Any         \nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged     \narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial            \nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares    \nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial    \nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or \nits affiliates may pay the financial          \nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training      \nprograms, conferences, the development of     \ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or         \npromotion of the Fund. These payments may     \ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing  \nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and   \nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over   \nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or   \nvisit your financial intermediary's website   \nfor more information. 10 7 Table of Contents  \nAdditional Strategies Information Principal   \nStrategies General . Please see each Fund's   \n\u201cThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\u201d    \nsection under \u201cFund Summaries\u201d above for a    \ncomplete discussion of each Fund's principal  \ninvestment strategies. A Fund may invest in   \nvarious types of securities and engage in     \nvarious investment techniques which are not   \nthe principal focus of the Fund and therefore \nare not described in this Prospectus. These   \nsecurities, techniques and practices, together\nwith their risks, are described in the        \nStatement of Additional Information (the      \n\u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain free of charge by\ncontacting shareholder services (see the back \ncover of this Prospectus for the address and  \nphone number). The Adviser seeks to track the \nperformance of each Fund's Index as closely as\npossible (i.e., obtain a high degree of       \ncorrelation with the Index). A number of      \nfactors may affect a Fund's ability to achieve\na high degree of correlation with its Index,  \nand there can be no guarantee that a Fund will\nachieve a high degree of correlation. For     \nexample, a Fund may not be able to achieve a  \nhigh degree of correlation with its Index when\nthere are practical difficulties or           \nsubstantial costs involved in compiling a     \nportfolio of securities to follow the Index,  \nwhen a security in the Index becomes          \ntemporarily illiquid, unavailable or less     \nliquid, or legal restrictions exist that      \nprohibit the Fund from investing in a security\nin the Index. The Adviser will utilize a      \nsampling strategy in managing the Funds.      \nSampling means that the Adviser uses          \nquantitative analysis to select securities,   \nincluding securities in the Index, outside of \nthe Index and derivatives that have a similar \ninvestment profile as the relevant Index in   \nterms of key risk factors, performance        \nattributes and other economic characteristics.\nThese include industry weightings, market     \ncapitalization, and other financial           \ncharacteristics of securities. The quantity of\nholdings in a Fund will be based on a number  \nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. \nIn addition, from time to time, securities are\nadded to or removed from each Index. The      \nAdviser may sell securities that are          \nrepresented in an Index, or purchase          \nsecurities that are not yet represented in an \nIndex, in anticipation of their removal from  \nor addition to an Index. Further, the Adviser \nmay choose to overweight securities in an     \nIndex, purchase or sell securities not in an  \nIndex, or utilize various combinations of     \nother available techniques, in seeking to     \ntrack an Index. The SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg     \nBarclays High Yield Municipal Bond ETF, SPDR  \nNuveen Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond ETF  \nand SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Short Term \nMunicipal Bond ETF (each a \u201cMunicipal Bond    \nETF,\u201d collectively the \u201cMunicipal Bond ETFs\u201d) \nhave adopted a fundamental investment policy  \nand certain of the other Funds as described in\nthe SAI, have adopted a non-fundamental       \ninvestment policy to invest at least 80% of   \ntheir respective net assets, plus the amount  \nof borrowings for investment purposes, in     \ninvestments suggested by their respective     \nnames, measured at the time of investment. A  \nFund will provide shareholders with at least  \n60 days' notice prior to any change in this   \nnon-fundamental 80% investment policy. Any    \nchange to a Municipal Bond ETF's fundamental  \n80% investment policy will require shareholder\napproval. The Board of Trustees of the Trust  \n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change a Fund's investment  \nstrategy, Index and other policies without    \nshareholder approval, except as otherwise     \nindicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI.   \nThe Board may also change a Fund's investment \nobjective without shareholder approval. Non-  \nPrincipal Strategies Certain Other Investments\n. Each Fund may invest in structured notes    \n(notes on which the amount of principal       \nrepayment and interest payments are based on  \nthe movement of one or more specified factors \nsuch as the movement of a particular security \nor index), swaps, options and futures         \ncontracts. Swaps, options and futures         \ncontracts and structured notes may be used by \na Fund in seeking performance that corresponds\nto its Index and in managing cash flows.      \nTemporary Defensive Positions . In certain    \nsituations or market conditions, a Fund may   \ntemporarily depart from its normal investment \npolicies and strategies, provided that the    \nalternative is consistent with the Fund's     \ninvestment objective and is in the best       \ninterest of the Fund. For example, a Fund may \nmake larger than normal investments in        \nderivatives to maintain exposure to its Index \nif it is unable to invest directly in a       \ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . Each    \nFund may borrow money from a bank as permitted\nby the Investment Company Act of 1940, as     \namended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing      \nstatute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the   \nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission       \n(\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with       \nauthority over the Fund, but only for         \ntemporary or emergency purposes. Each Fund may\nalso invest in reverse repurchase agreements, \nwhich are considered borrowings under the 1940\nAct. Although the 1940 Act presently allows a \nFund to borrow from any bank (including       \npledging, mortgaging or 10 8 Table of Contents\nhypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/\n3% of its total assets (not including         \ntemporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of   \nits total assets), and there is no percentage \nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in      \nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nunder normal circumstances any borrowings by a\nFund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's total  \nassets. Lending of Securities . Each Fund may \nlend its portfolio securities in an amount not\nto exceed 40% of the value of its net assets  \nvia a securities lending program through its  \nsecurities lending agent, State Street Bank   \nand Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d or the      \n\u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers, dealers and     \nother financial institutions desiring to      \nborrow securities to complete transactions and\nfor other purposes. A securities lending      \nprogram allows a Fund to receive a portion of \nthe income generated by lending its securities\nand investing the respective collateral. A    \nFund will receive collateral for each loaned  \nsecurity which is at least equal to the market\nvalue of that security, marked to market each \ntrading day. In the securities lending        \nprogram, the borrower generally has the right \nto vote the loaned securities; however, a Fund\nmay call loans to vote proxies if a material  \nissue affecting the Fund's economic interest  \nin the investment is to be voted upon.        \nSecurity loans may be terminated at any time  \nby a Fund.

Investment-Grade\nSecurities Risk . Securities rated below\ninvestment-grade and unrated securities of\ncomparable credit quality (commonly known as\n\u201chigh-yield bonds\u201d or \u201cjunk bonds\u201d) lack\nstrong investment-grade characteristics, are\nconsidered predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the issuer's continuing ability to\nmake principal and interest payments, and are\nsubject to greater levels of credit, liquidity\nand market risk than higher-rated securities.\nThey can involve a substantially greater risk\nof default than higher-rated securities, and\ntheir values can decline significantly over\nshort periods of time. Issuers of lower-\nquality debt securities may have substantially\ngreater risk of insolvency or bankruptcy than\nissuers of higher-quality debt securities. In\nthe event the issuer of a debt security held\nby a Fund defaults on its payments or becomes\ninsolvent or bankrupt, the Fund may not\nreceive the return it was promised on the\ninvestment and could lose its entire\ninvestment. The lower ratings of junk bonds\nreflect a greater possibility that actual or\nperceived adverse changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuer or in general economic\nconditions, or an unanticipated rise in\ninterest rates, may impair the ability of the\nissuer to make payments of interest and\nprincipal. If this were to occur, the values\nof such securities held by a Fund may fall\nsubstantially and a Fund could lose some or\nall of the value of its investment. Lower-\nquality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or\nthe market or economy in general, than higher\nquality debt securities. The market for lower\nquality debt securities can be less liquid\nthan for higher quality debt securities,\nespecially during periods of recession or\ngeneral market decline, which could make it\ndifficult at times for a Fund to sell certain\nsecurities at prices used in calculating a\nFund's net asset value. These securities may\nhave significant volatility. Call/Prepayment\nRisk . Call/prepayment risk is the risk that\nan issuer will exercise its right to pay\nprincipal on an obligation held by a Fund\nearlier than expected or required. This may\noccur, for example, when there is a decline in\ninterest rates, and an issuer of bonds or\npreferred stock redeems the bonds or stock in\norder to replace them with obligations on\nwhich it is required to pay a lower interest\nor dividend rate. It may also occur when there\nis an unanticipated increase in the rate at\nwhich mortgages or other receivables\nunderlying mortgage- or asset-backed\nsecurities held by a Fund are prepaid. In any\nsuch case, a Fund may be forced to invest the\nprepaid amounts in lower-yielding investments,\nresulting in a decline in the Fund's income.\nCash Transaction Risk . To the extent that a\nFund sells portfolio securities to meet some\nor all of a redemption request with cash, the\nFund may incur taxable gains or losses that it\nmight not have incurred had it made\nredemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, a\nFund may pay out higher annual capital gain\ndistributions than if the in-kind redemption\nprocess was used. Communication Services\nSector Risk. Communication services companies\nare particularly vulnerable to the potential\nobsolescence of products and services due to\ntechnological advancement and the innovation\nof competitors. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may also be affected by other\ncompetitive pressures, such as pricing\ncompetition, as well as research and\ndevelopment costs, substantial capital\nrequirements and government regulation.\nAdditionally, fluctuating domestic and\ninternational demand, shifting demographics\nand often unpredictable changes in consumer\ntastes can drastically affect a communication\nservices company's profitability. While all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nConsumer Cyclical Sector Risk . Companies in\nthe consumer cyclical sector are largely\nimpacted by the performance of the overall\nglobal economy, changes in interest rates,\nfluctuations in supply and demand, and changes\nin consumer preferences. Success depends\nheavily on disposable household income and\nconsumer spending. As a result, consumer\ncyclical companies may be adversely affected\nand lose value quickly in periods of economic\ndownturns. Also, companies in the consumer\ncyclical sector may be subject to severe\ncompetition, which may have an adverse impact\non their respective profitability. Consumer\nNon-Cyclical Sector Risk . Investments in the\nconsumer non-cyclical sector involve risks\nassociated with companies that manufacture\nproducts and provide discretionary services\ndirectly to the consumer. Performance of\ncompanies in the consumer non-cyclical sector\nmay be adversely impacted by fluctuations in\nsupply and demand, changes in the global\neconomy, consumer spending, competition,\ndemographics and consumer preferences, and\nproduction spending. Companies in the consumer\nnon-cyclical sector are also affected by\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, and economic conditions. The products\nof consumer non-cyclical companies are subject\nto government regulation which may negatively\nimpact such companies' performance. 116 Table\nof Contents Convertible Securities Risk .\nConvertible securities are bonds, debentures,\nnotes, preferred stocks or other securities\nthat may be converted or exchanged (by the\nholder or by the issuer, depending on the\nterms of the securities) into shares of the\nunderlying common stock (or cash or securities\nof equivalent value) at a stated exchange\nratio. Convertible securities may be\nsubordinate to other debt securities issued by\nthe same issuer. Issuers of convertible\nsecurities are often not as strong financially\nas issuers with higher credit ratings.\nConvertible securities typically provide\nyields lower than comparable non-convertible\nsecurities. Their values may be more volatile\nthan those of non-convertible securities,\nreflecting changes in the values of the\nsecurities into which they are convertible.\nCounterparty Risk . A Fund will be subject to\ncredit risk with respect to the counterparties\nwith which the Fund enters into derivatives\ncontracts and other transactions such as\nrepurchase agreements or reverse repurchase\nagreements. A Fund's ability to profit from\nthese types of investments and transactions\nwill depend on the willingness and ability of\nits counterparty to perform its obligations.\nIf a counterparty fails to meet its\ncontractual obligations, a Fund may be unable\nto terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. A Fund may experience significant\ndelays in obtaining any recovery in an\ninsolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any\ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in\nsuch circumstances. If a Fund holds collateral\nposted by its counterparty, it may be delayed\nor prevented from realizing on the collateral\nin the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding relating to the counterparty. Under\napplicable law or contractual provisions,\nincluding if a Fund enters into an investment\nor transaction with a financial institution\nand such financial institution (or an\naffiliate of the financial institution)\nexperiences financial difficulties, then the\nFund may in certain situations be prevented or\ndelayed from exercising its rights to\nterminate the investment or transaction, or to\nrealize on any collateral and may result in\nthe suspension of payment and delivery\nobligations of the parties under such\ninvestment or transactions or in another\ninstitution being substituted for that\nfinancial institution without the consent of\nthe Fund. Further, a Fund may be subject to\n\u201cbail-in\u201d risk under applicable law whereby,\nif required by the financial institution's\nauthority, the financial institution's\nliabilities could be written down, eliminated\nor converted into equity or an alternative\ninstrument of ownership. A bail-in of a\nfinancial institution may result in a\nreduction in value of some or all of its\nsecurities and, if a Fund holds such\nsecurities or has entered into a transaction\nwith such a financial security when a bail-in\noccurs, such Fund may also be similarly\nimpacted. Credit Risk . Credit risk is the\nrisk that an issuer, guarantor or liquidity\nprovider of a fixed-income security held by a\nFund may be unable or unwilling, or may be\nperceived (whether by market participants,\nratings agencies, pricing services or\notherwise) as unable or unwilling, to make\ntimely principal and/or interest payments, or\nto otherwise honor its obligations. It\nincludes the risk that the security will be\ndowngraded by a credit rating agency;\ngenerally, lower credit quality issuers\npresent higher credit risks. An actual or\nperceived decline in creditworthiness of an\nissuer of a fixed-income security held by a\nFund may result in a decrease in the value of\nthe security. It is possible that the ability\nof an issuer to meet its obligations will\ndecline substantially during the period when a\nFund owns securities of the issuer or that the\nissuer will default on its obligations or that\nthe obligations of the issuer will be limited\nor restructured. The credit rating assigned to\nany particular investment does not necessarily\nreflect the issuer's current financial\ncondition and does not reflect an assessment\nof an investment's volatility or liquidity.\nSecurities rated in the lowest category of\ninvestment-grade are considered to have\nspeculative characteristics. If a security\nheld by a Fund loses its rating or its rating\nis downgraded, the Fund may nonetheless\ncontinue to hold the security in the\ndiscretion of the Adviser. In the case of\nasset-backed or mortgage-related securities,\nchanges in the actual or perceived ability of\nthe obligors on the underlying assets or\nmortgages to make payments of interest and/or\nprincipal may affect the values of those\nsecurities. Debt Securities Risk . The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of a\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, a\ndecline in a Fund's income and yield, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of a Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, a\nFund's 117 Table of Contents yield can be low,\nand a Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it\nmay lose money on an operating basis). If the\nprincipal on a debt obligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the prepayments of principal\nmay have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods\nof falling interest rates, the income received\nby a Fund may decline. Changes in interest\nrates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Derivatives Risk. A derivative is\na financial contract the value of which\ndepends on, or is derived from, the value of\nan underlying asset, interest rate, or index.\nDerivative transactions typically involve\nleverage and may have significant volatility.\nIt is possible that a derivative transaction\nwill result in a loss greater than the\nprincipal amount invested, and a Fund may not\nbe able to close out a derivative transaction\nat a favorable time or price. Risks associated\nwith derivative instruments include potential\nchanges in value in response to interest rate\nchanges or other market developments or as a\nresult of the counterparty's credit quality;\nthe potential for the derivative transaction\nnot to have the effect the Adviser or Sub-\nAdviser anticipated or a different or less\nfavorable effect than the Adviser or Sub-\nAdviser anticipated; the failure of the\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction to\nperform its obligations under the transaction\nor to settle a trade; possible mispricing or\nimproper valuation of the derivative\ninstrument; imperfect correlation in the value\nof a derivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that a\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including without\nlimitation absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to a\nFund due to losses on the transaction and an\nincrease in volatility; the potential for the\nderivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction.\nFutures Contract Risk; Other Exchange-Traded\nDerivatives Risk . The risk of loss relating\nto the use of futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives is potentially\nunlimited. The ability to establish and close\nout positions in futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives will be subject to\nthe development and maintenance of a liquid\nsecondary market. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract or\nother exchange-traded derivative or at any\nparticular time. In the event no such market\nexists for a particular derivative, it might\nnot be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate the derivative. In using futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives, the Fund will be reliant on the\nability of the Adviser to predict market and\nprice movements correctly; the skills needed\nto use such derivatives successfully are\ndifferent from those needed for traditional\nportfolio management. If the Fund uses futures\ncontracts or other exchange-traded derivatives\nfor hedging purposes, there is a risk of\nimperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the derivatives and movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying the derivatives\nor movements in the prices of the Fund's\ninvestments that are the subject of such\nhedge. The prices of futures and other\nexchange-traded derivatives, for a number of\nreasons, may not correlate perfectly with\nmovements in the securities or index\nunderlying them. For example, participants in\nthe futures markets and in markets for other\nexchange-traded derivatives are subject to\nmargin deposit requirements. Such requirements\nmay cause investors to take actions with\nrespect to their derivatives positions that\nthey would not otherwise take. The margin\nrequirements in the derivatives markets may be\nless onerous than margin requirements in the\nsecurities markets in general, and as a result\nthose markets may attract more speculators\nthan the securities markets do. Increased\nparticipation by speculators in those markets\nmay cause temporary price distortions. Due to\nthe possibility of price distortion, even a\ncorrect forecast of general market trends by\nthe Adviser still may not result in a\nsuccessful derivatives activity over a very\nshort time period. The risk of a position in a\nfutures contract or other exchange-traded\nderivative may be very large compared to the\nrelatively low level of margin the Fund is\nrequired to deposit. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its exchange-traded\nderivatives transactions. The Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with\nits transactions in futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives. In the\nevent of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, the\nFund may not be able to recover all (or any)\nof the margin it has posted with the futures\ncommission merchant, or to realize the value\nof any increase in the price of its positions,\nor it may 118 Table of Contents experience a\nsignificant delay in doing so. The Fund also\nmay be delayed or prevented from recovering\nmargin or other amounts deposited with a\nfutures commission merchant or futures\nclearinghouse. The Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various\nexchanges have established limits referred to\nas \u201cspeculative position limits\u201d on the\nmaximum net long or net short positions that\nany person and certain affiliated entities may\nhold or control in a particular futures\ncontract. Trading limits are imposed on the\nnumber of contracts that any person may trade\non a particular trading day. An exchange may\norder the liquidation of positions found to be\nin violation of these limits and it may impose\nsanctions or restrictions. In addition, the\nDodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to establish\nspeculative position limits on certain\ncommodity futures contracts and their\neconomically equivalent futures, options and\nswaps. Regulatory action taken by the CFTC to\nestablish these additional position limits may\nadversely affect the market liquidity of the\nfutures, options and economically equivalent\nderivatives in which the Fund may invest. It\nis possible that, as a result of such limits,\nthe Fund's Adviser will be precluded from\ntaking positions in certain futures contracts\nor over-the-counter derivatives as a result of\npositions held by other clients of the Adviser\nor Sub-Adviser or by the Adviser or Sub-\nAdviser or its affiliates themselves. Futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives traded on markets outside the U.S.\nare not generally subject to the same level of\nregulation by the CFTC or other U.S.\nregulatory entities as contracts traded in the\nU.S., including without limitation as to the\nexecution, delivery, and clearing of\ntransactions. U.S. regulators neither regulate\nthe activities of a foreign exchange, nor have\nthe power to compel enforcement of the rules\nof the foreign exchange or the laws of the\nforeign country in question. Margin and other\npayments made by a Fund may not be afforded\nthe same protections as are afforded those\npayments in the U.S., including in connection\nwith the insolvency of an executing or\nclearing broker or a clearinghouse or\nexchange. Certain foreign futures contracts\nand other exchange-traded derivatives may be\nless liquid and more volatile than U.S.\ncontracts. Swaps Risk. A swap is a two-party\ncontract that generally obligates one party to\npay the positive return and the other party to\npay the negative return on a specified\nreference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment\nin securities, because swaps may be leveraged\nand are subject to counterparty risk (e.g. ,\nthe risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and\npricing risk (i.e. , swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). Swaps may also be considered illiquid.\nIt may not be possible for a Fund to liquidate\na swap position at an advantageous time or\nprice, which may result in significant losses.\nExtension Risk. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, the average life of certain\ntypes of securities may be extended because of\nslower-than-expected principal payments. This\nmay increase the period of time during which\nan investment earns a below-market interest\nrate, increase the security's duration and\nreduce the value of the security. Extension\nrisk may be heightened during periods of\nadverse economic conditions generally, as\npayment rates decline due to higher\nunemployment levels and other factors.\nFinancial Sector Risk. Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation which may limit both\nthe amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may\ncause an unusually high degree of volatility\nin the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to\nraise capital (such as the issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or cease operations.\nCredit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses\nassociated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or\npolitical developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage\nfinance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk\n. The net asset value of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate with changes in the market\nvalue of a Fund's securities holdings. The\nmarket prices of Fund Shares will generally\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in a\nFund's net asset value and supply and demand\nof Fund 119 Table of Contents Shares on the\nExchange. It cannot be predicted whether Fund\nShares will trade below, at or above their net\nasset value. Price differences may be due, in\nlarge part, to the fact that supply and demand\nforces at work in the secondary trading market\nfor Fund Shares will be closely related to,\nbut not identical to, the same forces\ninfluencing the prices of the securities of an\nIndex trading individually or in the aggregate\nat any point in time. The market prices of\nFund Shares may deviate significantly from the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares during periods\nof market volatility. However, given that Fund\nShares can be created and redeemed in Creation\nUnits (unlike shares of many closed-end funds,\nwhich frequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at premiums to,\ntheir net asset value), the Adviser (and Sub-\nAdviser, as applicable) believe that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to a\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from such Fund's net asset\nvalue. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto the net asset value of Fund Shares or sells\nat a time when the market price is at a\ndiscount to the net asset value of Fund\nShares, then the investor may sustain losses.\nGeographic Focus Risk . The performance of a\nfund that is less diversified across countries\nor geographic regions will be closely tied to\nmarket, currency, economic, political,\nenvironmental, or regulatory conditions and\ndevelopments in the countries or regions in\nwhich the fund invests, and may be more\nvolatile than the performance of a more\ngeographically-diversified fund. Europe . The\nEconomic and Monetary Union of the EU requires\ncompliance with restrictions on inflation\nrates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels\nand fiscal and monetary controls, each of\nwhich may significantly affect every country\nin Europe. Decreasing imports or exports,\nchanges in governmental or EU regulations on\ntrade, changes in the exchange rate of the\neuro (the common currency of certain EU\ncountries), the default or threat of default\nby an EU member country on its sovereign debt,\nand/or an economic recession in an EU member\ncountry may have a significant adverse effect\non the economies of EU member countries and\ntheir trading partners. The European financial\nmarkets have recently experienced volatility\nand adverse trends due to concerns about\neconomic downturns or rising government debt\nlevels in several European countries,\nincluding Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and\nSpain. These events have adversely affected\nthe exchange rate of the euro and may continue\nto significantly affect every country in\nEurope, including countries that do not use\nthe euro. Responses to the financial problems\nby European governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results,\nmay result in social unrest and may limit\nfuture growth and economic recovery or have\nother unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. For example, in June 2016, citizens of the\nUnited Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave\nthe EU (known as \u201cBrexit\u201d), creating economic\nand political uncertainty in its wake and\nresulting in S&P downgrading the EU's credit\nrating from \u201cAA+\u201d to \u201cAA\u201d in the days\nfollowing the vote. The country's referendum\nvote sparked depreciation in the value of the\nBritish pound, short-term declines in the\nstock markets and heightened risk of continued\neconomic volatility worldwide. In March 2017,\nthe United Kingdom formally notified the\nEuropean Council of the United Kingdom's\nintention to withdraw from the EU pursuant to\nArticle 50 of the Treaty on European Union.\nThis formal notification began a multi-year\nperiod of negotiations regarding the terms of\nthe United Kingdom's exit from the EU, which\nformally occurred on January 31, 2020. The\nUnited Kingdom is currently in a transition\nperiod where it remains subject to EU rules\nbut has no role in the EU lawmaking process.\nDuring this transition period, United Kingdom\nand EU representatives are negotiating the\nprecise terms of their future relationship.\nThe transition period is scheduled to end on\nDecember 31, 2020. The full scope and nature\nof the consequences of the exit are not at\nthis time known and are unlikely to be known\nfor a significant period of time. It is also\nunknown whether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. 120 Table of Contents\nIncome Risk. A Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors.\nIssuers of securities held by a Fund may call\nor redeem the securities during periods of\nfalling interest rates, and the Fund would\nlikely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation\nheld by a Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates. A\nreduction in the income earned by a Fund may\nlimit the Fund's ability to achieve its\nobjective. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk . Each Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities. Each Fund will seek to replicate\nIndex returns, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. Each Fund generally will buy and will\nnot sell a security included in the Index as\nlong as the security is part of the Index\nregardless of any sudden or material decline\nin value or foreseeable material decline in\nvalue of the security, even though the Adviser\nmay make a different investment decision for\nother actively managed accounts or portfolios\nthat hold the security. As a result, a Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms and\nby comparison with other indices) and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index\nin accordance with its methodology may occur\nfrom time to time and may not be identified\nand corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on a Fund and its shareholders.\nWhile the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with the Index), a\nFund's return may not match the return of the\nIndex for a number of reasons. For example,\nthe return on the sample of securities\npurchased by a Fund (or the return on\nsecurities not included in the Index) to\nreplicate the performance of the Index may not\ncorrelate precisely with the return of the\nIndex. Each Fund incurs a number of operating\nexpenses not applicable to the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying and selling securities.\nIn addition, a Fund may not be fully invested\nat times, either as a result of cash flows\ninto or out of the Fund or reserves of cash\nheld by the Fund to meet redemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to track the Index return\nby investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between a\nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes\nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact a Fund's ability\nto match the return of the Index. The Adviser\nmay apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment\ntechniques to refine or limit the number or\ntypes of issuers included in the Index in\nwhich a Fund may invest. Application of such\nscreens or techniques may result in investment\nperformance below that of the Index and may\nnot produce results expected by the Adviser.\nIndex tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. Pursuant to each\nIndex methodology, a security may be removed\nfrom an Index in the event that it does not\ncomply with the eligibility requirements of\nthe Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced\nto sell securities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the\nIndex components. When there are changes made\nto the component securities of an Index and\nthe corresponding Fund in turn makes similar\nchanges to its portfolio to attempt to\nincrease the correlation between the Fund's\nportfolio and the Index, any transaction costs\nand market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled\nchanges to an Index may expose the\ncorresponding Fund to additional tracking\nerror risk. A Fund may recognize gains as a\nresult of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the corresponding\nIndex. A Fund also may be required to\ndistribute any such gains to its shareholders\nto avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. Inflation-Indexed Securities\nRisk . The principal amount of an inflation-\nindexed security typically increases with\ninflation and decreases with deflation, as\nmeasured by a specified index. It is possible\nthat, in a period of declining inflation\nrates, a Fund could receive at maturity less\nthan the initial principal amount of an\ninflation-indexed security. Although the\nholders of U.S. TIPS receive no less than the\npar value of the security at maturity, if a\nFund purchases U.S. TIPS in the secondary\nmarket whose principal values have previously\nbeen adjusted upward and there is a period of\nsubsequent declining inflation rates, a Fund\nmay receive at maturity less than it invested.\nDepending on the changes in inflation rates\nduring the period a Fund holds an inflation-\nindexed security, a Fund may earn less on the\nsecurity than on a conventional bond. The\nprincipal amounts of inflation-indexed\nsecurities are typically only adjusted\nperiodically, and changes in the values of the\nsecurities may only approximately reflect\nchanges in inflation rates and may occur\nsubstantially after the changes in inflation\nrates in question occur. 121 Table of Contents\nInterest Rate Risk . Interest rate risk is the\nrisk that the securities held by a Fund will\ndecline in value because of increases in\nmarket interest rates. Duration is a measure\nused to determine the sensitivity of a\nsecurity's price to changes in interest rates.\nDebt securities with longer durations tend to\nbe more sensitive to changes in interest\nrates, usually making them more volatile than\ndebt securities with shorter durations. For\nexample, the value of a security with a\nduration of five years would be expected to\ndecrease by 5% for every 1% increase in\ninterest rates. Falling interest rates also\ncreate the potential for a decline in a Fund's\nincome and yield. Interest-only and principal-\nonly securities are especially sensitive to\ninterest rate changes, which can affect not\nonly their prices but can also change the\nincome flows and repayment assumptions about\nthose investments. Variable and floating rate\nsecurities also generally increase or decrease\nin value in response to changes in interest\nrates, although generally to a lesser degree\nthan fixed-rate securities. A substantial\nincrease in interest rates may also have an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of a security,\nespecially those with longer durations.\nInterest rate changes can be sudden and\nunpredictable, and are influenced by a number\nof factors, including government policy,\nmonetary policy, inflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply and demand for\nbonds. Changes in government or central bank\npolicy, including changes in tax policy or\nchanges in a central bank's implementation of\nspecific policy goals, may have a substantial\nimpact on interest rates. This could lead to\nheightened levels of interest rate, volatility\nand liquidity risks for the fixed income\nmarkets generally and could have a substantial\nand immediate effect on the values of a Fund's\ninvestments. There can be no guarantee that\nany particular government or central bank\npolicy will be continued, discontinued or\nchanged, nor that any such policy will have\nthe desired effect on interest rates.\nLeveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,\nreverse repurchase agreements, certain\nderivatives transactions, securities lending\ntransactions and other investment transactions\nsuch as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or\nforward commitment transactions may create\ninvestment leverage. If a Fund engages in\ntransactions that have a leveraging effect on\nthe Fund's investment portfolio, the value of\nthe Fund will be potentially more volatile and\nall other risks will tend to be compounded.\nThis is because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than a Fund would otherwise have and\nso magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses to a Fund. Certain\nderivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause a\nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to\nmeet asset segregation or coverage\nrequirements. LIBOR Risk . On July 27, 2017,\nthe United Kingdom's Financial Conduct\nAuthority, which regulates LIBOR, announced\nthat it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end\nof 2021. There remains uncertainty regarding\nthe future of LIBOR and whether it will\ncontinue to exist in its current, or a\nmodified, form. There is also uncertainty\nsurrounding the nature of any replacement\nrate. Certain alternatives to LIBOR have been\nestablished or are in development in most\nmajor currencies, including the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is\nintended to replace the U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The\nreplacement and/or discontinuation of LIBOR\ncould lead to significant short-term and long-\nterm uncertainty and market instability. The\nunavailability and/or discontinuation of LIBOR\ncould have adverse impacts on newly issued\nfinancial instruments and existing financial\ninstruments that reference LIBOR. While some\ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate setting methodology, not\nall instruments may have such provisions and\nthere is uncertainty regarding the\neffectiveness of any alternative methodology.\nAbandonment of or modifications to LIBOR could\nlead to significant short-term and long-term\nuncertainty and market instability. In\naddition, the unavailability or replacement of\nLIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or\nreturn on certain Fund investments and may\nresult in costs incurred in connection with\nclosing out positions and entering into new\ntrades. Any pricing adjustments to a Fund's\ninvestments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect the\nFund's performance and/or NAV. Liquidity Risk\n. Liquidity risk is the risk that a Fund may\nnot be able to dispose of securities or close\nout derivatives transactions readily at a\nfavorable time or prices (or at all) or at\nprices approximating those at which a Fund\ncurrently values them. For example, certain\ninvestments may be subject to restrictions on\nresale, may trade in the over-the-counter\nmarket or in limited volume, or may not have\nan active trading market. Illiquid securities\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for a Fund to value illiquid\nsecurities accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular 122 Table of Contents issuer.\nDisposal of illiquid securities may entail\nregistration expenses and other transaction\ncosts that are higher than those for liquid\nsecurities. A Fund may seek to borrow money to\nmeet its obligations (including among other\nthings redemption obligations) if it is unable\nto dispose of illiquid investments, resulting\nin borrowing expenses and possible leveraging\nof the Fund. Low Short-Term Interest Rates\nRisk . During market conditions in which\nshort-term interest rates are at low levels, a\nFund's yield can be very low, and a Fund may\nhave a negative yield (i.e. , it may lose\nmoney on an operating basis). During these\nconditions, it is possible that a Fund will\ngenerate an insufficient amount of income to\npay its expenses, and will not be able to pay\nits scheduled dividend. In addition, it is\npossible that during these conditions a Fund\nmay experience difficulties purchasing and/or\nselling securities with respect to scheduled\nrebalances, and may, as a result, maintain a\nportion of its assets in cash, on which it may\nearn little, if any, income. Such market\nconditions may adversely affect a Fund's\nability to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index. Market Risk .\nMarket prices of investments held by a Fund\nwill go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. A Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile,\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in a\nFund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities\nprices. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments. An outbreak of a respiratory\ndisease caused by a novel coronavirus (known\nas COVID-19) first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has resulted in a global\npandemic and major disruptions to economies\nand markets around the world, including the\nUnited States. Financial markets have\nexperienced extreme volatility and severe\nlosses, and trading in many instruments has\nbeen disrupted. Liquidity for many instruments\nhas been greatly reduced for periods of time.\nSome interest rates are very low and in some\ncases yields are negative. Governments and\ncentral banks, including the Federal Reserve\nin the United States, have taken extraordinary\nand unprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.\nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some\ntime. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19,\nand measures taken to mitigate its effects,\ncould result in disruptions to the services\nprovided to a Fund by its service providers.\nMoney Market Risk . An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not a deposit of any bank and\nis not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or\nany other government agency. Certain money\nmarket funds seek to preserve the value of\ntheir shares at $1.00 per share, although\nthere can be no assurance that they will do\nso, and it is possible to lose money by\ninvesting in such a money market fund. A major\nor unexpected change in interest rates or a\ndecline in the credit quality of an issuer or\nentity providing credit support, an inactive\ntrading market for money market instruments,\nor adverse market, economic, industry,\npolitical, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause the share price of such\na money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will\nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at\ntimes when the fair value of the money market\nfund's portfolio per share is more or less\nthan $1.00. None of State Street Corporation,\nState Street, State Street Global Advisors\n(\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (\u201cState\nStreet Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an\ninvestment in a money market fund at $1.00 per\nshare. Investors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market\nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV\nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the\nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or\nless than their original purchase price.\nRecent changes in the regulation of money\nmarket funds may affect the operations and\nstructures of money market funds. A money\nmarket fund may be permitted or required to\nimpose redemption fees or to impose\nlimitations on redemptions during periods of\nhigh illiquidity in the markets for the\ninvestments held by it. Mortgage-Related and\nOther Asset-Backed Securities Risk .\nInvestments in mortgage-related and other\nasset-backed securities are subject to the\nrisk of significant credit downgrades,\nilliquidity, and defaults to a greater extent\nthan many other types of fixed income\ninvestments. The liquidity of mortgage-related\nand asset-backed securities may change over\ntime. Mortgage-related securities represent a\nparticipation in, or are secured by, mortgage\nloans. Other asset- 123 Table of Contents\nbacked securities are typically structured\nlike mortgage-related securities, but instead\nof mortgage loans or interests in mortgage\nloans, the underlying assets may include, for\nexample, items such as motor vehicle\ninstallment sales or installment loan\ncontracts, leases on various types of real and\npersonal property, and receivables from credit\ncard agreements. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, mortgage-related and other\nasset-backed securities, which typically\nprovide the issuer with the right to prepay\nthe security prior to maturity, may be\nprepaid, which may result in a Fund having to\nreinvest the proceeds in other investments at\nlower interest rates. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, the average life of mortgage-\nrelated and other asset-backed securities may\nextend because of slower-than expected\nprincipal payments. This may lock in a below\nmarket interest rate, increase the security's\nduration and interest rate sensitivity, and\nreduce the value of the security. As a result,\nmortgage-related and other asset-backed\nsecurities may have less potential for capital\nappreciation during periods of declining\ninterest rates than other debt securities of\ncomparable maturities, although they may have\na similar risk of decline in market values\nduring periods of rising interest rates.\nPrepayment rates are difficult to predict and\nthe potential impact of prepayments on the\nvalue of a mortgage-related or other asset-\nbacked security depends on the terms of the\ninstrument and can result in significant\nvolatility. The price of a mortgage-related or\nother asset-backed security also depends on\nthe credit quality and adequacy of the\nunderlying assets or collateral. Defaults on\nthe underlying assets, if any, may impair the\nvalue of a mortgage-related or other asset-\nbacked security. For some asset-backed\nsecurities in which a Fund invests, such as\nthose backed by credit card receivables, the\nunderlying cash flows may not be supported by\na security interest in a related asset.\nMoreover, the values of mortgage-related and\nother asset-backed securities may be\nsubstantially dependent on the servicing of\nthe underlying asset pools, and are therefore\nsubject to risks associated with the\nnegligence or malfeasance by their servicers\nand to the credit risk of their servicers. In\ncertain situations, the mishandling of related\ndocumentation may also affect the rights of\nsecurities holders in and to the underlying\ncollateral. There may be legal and practical\nlimitations on the enforceability of any\nsecurity interest granted with respect to\nunderlying assets, or the value of the\nunderlying assets, if any, may be insufficient\nif the issuer defaults. In a \u201cforward roll\u201d\ntransaction, a Fund will sell a mortgage-\nrelated security to a bank or other permitted\nentity and simultaneously agree to purchase a\nsimilar security from the institution at a\nlater date at an agreed upon price. The\nmortgage securities that are purchased will\nbear the same interest rate as those sold, but\ngenerally will be collateralized by different\npools of mortgages with different prepayment\nhistories than those sold. The values of such\ntransactions will be affected by many of the\nsame factors that affect the values of\nmortgage-related securities generally. In\naddition, forward roll transactions may have\nthe effect of creating investment leverage in\na Fund. Municipal Obligations Risk. The U.S.\nmunicipal securities market is volatile and\ncan be significantly affected by adverse tax,\nlegislative, or political changes and the\nfinancial condition of the issuers of\nmunicipal securities. Municipal obligations\ninclude revenue obligations, which are\ngenerally backed by the revenues generated\nfrom a specific project or facility and\ninclude private activity bonds and industrial\ndevelopment bonds. Private activity and\nindustrial development bonds are dependent on\nthe ability of the facility's user to meet its\nfinancial obligations and on the value of any\nreal or personal property pledged as security\nfor such payment. Private activity and\nindustrial development bonds, although issued\nby industrial development authorities, may be\nbacked only by the assets of the non-\ngovernmental user. Because many municipal\nsecurities are issued to finance projects\nrelating to education, health care,\ntransportation and utilities, conditions in\nthose sectors can affect the overall municipal\nsecurities market. In addition, municipal\nsecurities backed by current or anticipated\nrevenues from a specific project or specific\nasset can be negatively affected by the\ndiscontinuance or reduction in the rate of the\ntaxation supporting the project or asset or\nthe inability to collect revenues for the\nproject or from the assets. If the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d)\ndetermines the issuer of a municipal security\nhas not complied with applicable tax\nrequirements, interest from the security could\nbecome taxable, and the security could decline\nin value. Municipal obligations may also be\nsubject to prepayment risk and extension risk.\nCertain states and other governmental entities\nhave experienced, and may continue to\nexperience, extreme financial pressures in\nresponse to financial, economic and other\nfactors, and may be, or be perceived to be,\nunable to meet all of their obligations under\nmunicipal bonds issued or guaranteed by them;\nsuch factors may result in substantial\nvolatility in municipal securities markets and\nlosses to the corresponding Fund.\nAdditionally, a Fund's portfolio may have\ngreater exposure to liquidity risk since the\nmarkets for such securities may be less liquid\nthan the traditional bond markets. There may\nalso be less information available on the\nfinancial condition of issuers of these types\nof securities than for public corporations.\nThis means that it may be harder to buy and\nsell such securities, especially on short\nnotice, and these securities may be more\ndifficult for a Fund to value accurately than\nsecurities of public corporations. 124 Table\nof Contents\n\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Investments in\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers entail risks\nnot typically associated with investing in\nsecurities of U.S. issuers. Similar risks may\napply to securities traded on a U.S.\nsecurities exchange that are issued by\nentities with significant exposure to non-U.S.\ncountries. In certain countries, legal\nremedies available to investors may be more\nlimited than those available with regard to\nU.S. investments. Because non-U.S. securities\nare typically denominated and traded in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, the\nvalue of the Fund's assets, to the extent they\nare non-U.S. dollar denominated, may be\naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency\nexchange rates, exchange control regulations,\nand delays, restrictions or prohibitions on\nthe repatriation of non-U.S. currencies. To\nthe extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are\nclosed when the exchange on which the Fund's\nshares trade is open, there may be deviations\nbetween the current price of an underlying\nsecurity and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign\nmarket. These deviations could result in the\nFund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Income and gains with\nrespect to investments in certain countries\nmay be subject to withholding and other taxes.\nThere may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to accounting, auditing, and\nfinancial reporting standards, regulatory\nframework and practices comparable to those in\nthe United States. The securities of some\nnon-U.S. entities are less liquid and at times\nmore volatile than securities of comparable\nU.S. entities, and could become subject to\nsanctions or embargoes that adversely affect a\nFund's investment. Non-U.S. transaction costs,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and custody\ncosts may be higher than in the U.S. In\naddition, there may be a possibility of\nnationalization or expropriation of assets,\nimposition of currency exchange controls,\nconfiscatory taxation, and diplomatic\ndevelopments that could adversely affect the\nvalues of a Fund's investments in certain\nnon-U.S. countries. Investments in securities\nof non-U.S. issuers also are subject to\nforeign political and economic risk not\nassociated with U.S. investments, meaning that\npolitical events (civil unrest, national\nelections, changes in political conditions and\nforeign relations, imposition of exchange\ncontrols and repatriation restrictions),\nsocial and economic events (labor strikes,\nrising inflation) and natural disasters\noccurring in a country where a Fund invests\ncould cause the Fund's investments in that\ncountry to experience gains or losses. Certain\ncountries have recently experienced (or\ncurrently are expected to experience) negative\ninterest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate\nconditions may be experienced in other\nregions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify a Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and\nperformance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Political Risk. A significant\nrestructuring of federal income tax rates or\neven serious discussion on the topic in\nCongress could cause municipal bond prices to\nfall. The demand for municipal securities is\nstrongly influenced by the value of tax-exempt\nincome to investors. Lower income tax rates\ncould reduce the advantage of owning\nmunicipals. Portfolio Turnover Risk . A Fund\nmay engage in frequent trading of its\nportfolio securities. Fund turnover generally\ninvolves a number of direct and indirect costs\nand expenses to a Fund, including, for\nexample, brokerage commissions, dealer mark-\nups and bid/asked spreads, and transaction\ncosts on the sale of securities and\nreinvestment in other securities. The costs\nrelated to increased portfolio turnover have\nthe effect of reducing a Fund's investment\nreturn, and the sale of securities by the Fund\nmay result in the realization of taxable\ncapital gains, including short-term capital\ngains. A Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities in connection with\nIndex rebalancing. Frequent trading may cause\na Fund to incur additional transaction costs\nand experience different tax consequences in\ncomparison to an ETF that does not engage in\nfrequent trading. Preferred Securities Risk .\nGenerally, preferred security holders have no\nor limited voting rights with respect to the\nissuing company. In addition, preferred\nsecurities are subordinated to bonds and other\ndebt instruments in a company's capital\nstructure and therefore will be subject to\ngreater credit risk than those debt\ninstruments. Unlike debt securities, dividend\npayments on a preferred security typically\nmust be declared by the issuer's board of\ndirectors. An issuer's board of directors is\ngenerally not under any obligation to pay a\ndividend (even if such dividends have\naccrued), and may suspend payment of dividends\non preferred securities at any time.\nTherefore, in the event an issuer of preferred\nsecurities experiences economic difficulties,\nthe issuer's preferred securities may lose\nsubstantial value due to the reduced\nlikelihood that the issuer's board of\ndirectors will declare a dividend and the fact\nthat the preferred security may be\nsubordinated to other securities of the same\nissuer. Further, because many preferred\nsecurities pay dividends at a fixed rate,\ntheir market price can be sensitive to changes\nin interest rates in a manner similar to bonds\n- that is, as interest rates rise, the value\nof the preferred securities held by a Fund are\nlikely to decline. Therefore, to the extent\nthat a Fund invests a substantial portion of\nits assets in fixed rate preferred securities,\nrising interest rates may 125 Table of\nContents cause the value of the Fund's\ninvestments to decline significantly. In\naddition, because many preferred securities\nallow holders to convert the preferred\nsecurities into common stock of the issuer,\ntheir market price can be sensitive to changes\nin the value of the issuer's common stock and,\ntherefore, declining common stock values may\nalso cause the value of a Fund's investments\nto decline. Preferred securities often have\ncall features which allow the issuer to redeem\nthe security at its discretion. The redemption\nof a preferred security having a higher than\naverage yield may cause a decrease in a Fund's\nyield. Private Activity Bonds Risk . Private\nactivity bonds are issued by or on behalf of\npublic authorities to obtain funds to provide\nprivately operated housing facilities,\nairport, mass transit or port facilities,\nsewage disposal, solid waste disposal or\nhazardous waste treatment or disposal\nfacilities and certain local facilities for\nwater supply, gas or electricity. Other types\nof private activity bonds, the proceeds of\nwhich are used for the construction,\nequipment, repair or improvement of privately\noperated industrial or commercial facilities,\nmay constitute municipal securities, although\nthe current federal tax laws place limitations\non the size of such issues. The credit and\nquality of private activity bonds are usually\nrelated to the credit of the corporate user of\nthe facilities. Payment of interest on and\nrepayment of principal of such bonds are the\nresponsibility of the corporate user (and/or\nany guarantor), which means that the holder of\nthe private activity bond is exposed to the\nrisk that the corporate user (and/or any\nguarantor) may default on the private activity\nbond. Conditions such as regulatory and\nenvironmental restrictions and economic\ndownturns may lower the need for and the\nability of corporate users to pay for the\nprojects financed by private activity bonds.\nThe Fund's distributions of its interest\nincome from private activity bonds may subject\ncertain investors to the federal alternative\nminimum tax. Reinvestment Risk. Income from a\nFund's portfolio may decline when the Fund\ninvests the proceeds from investment income,\nsales of portfolio securities or matured,\ntraded or called debt obligations. For\ninstance, during periods of declining interest\nrates, an issuer of debt obligations may\nexercise an option to redeem securities prior\nto maturity, forcing a Fund to reinvest the\nproceeds in lower-yielding securities. A\ndecline in income received by a Fund from its\ninvestments is likely to have a negative\neffect on the yield and total return of the\nFund Shares. Restricted Securities Risk . A\nFund may hold securities that have not been\nregistered for sale to the public under the\nU.S. federal securities laws pursuant to an\nexemption from registration. These securities\nmay be less liquid than securities registered\nfor sale to the general public. The liquidity\nof a restricted security may be affected by a\nnumber of factors, including, among others:\n(i) the creditworthiness of the issuer; (ii)\nthe frequency of trades and quotes for the\nsecurity; (iii) the number of dealers willing\nto purchase or sell the security and the\nnumber of other potential purchasers; (iv)\ndealer undertakings to make a market in the\nsecurity; (v) the nature of any legal\nrestrictions governing trading in the\nsecurity; and (vi) the nature of the security\nand the nature of marketplace trades. There\ncan be no assurance that a liquid trading\nmarket will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Also,\nrestricted securities may be difficult to\nvalue because market quotations may not be\nreadily available, and the securities may have\nsignificant volatility. Securities Lending\nRisk. Each Fund may lend portfolio securities\nin an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of\nits net assets. For these purposes, net assets\nshall exclude the value of all assets received\nas collateral for the loan. Such loans may be\nterminated at any time. Any such loans must be\ncontinuously secured by collateral maintained\non a current basis in an amount at least equal\nto the market value of the securities loaned\nby a Fund, marked to market each trading day.\nIn a loan transaction, as compensation for\nlending its securities, a Fund will receive a\nportion of the dividends or interest accrued\non the securities held as collateral or, in\nthe case of cash collateral, a portion of the\nincome from the investment of such cash. In\naddition, a Fund will receive the amount of\nall dividends, interest and other\ndistributions on the loaned securities.\nHowever, the borrower has the right to vote\nthe loaned securities. A Fund will call loans\nto vote proxies if a material issue affecting\nthe investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to\nrecall such securities promptly may be\nunsuccessful, especially for foreign\nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and\nmay involve expenses to a Fund. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. Should the borrower\nof the securities fail financially, a Fund may\nexperience delays in recovering the securities\nor exercising its rights in the collateral.\nLoans are made only to borrowers that are\ndeemed by the securities lending agent to be\nof good financial standing. In a loan\ntransaction, a Fund will also bear the risk of\nany decline in value of securities provided as\ncollateral or acquired with cash collateral.\nEach Fund will attempt to minimize this risk\nby limiting the investment of cash collateral\nto high quality instruments of short maturity\neither directly on behalf of the lending Fund\nor through one or more joint accounts or\nfunds, which may include those managed by the\nAdviser. To the extent the collateral provided\nor investments made 126 Table of Contents with\ncash collateral differ from securities\nincluded in an Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss\nthan the securities included in the Index. In\naddition, a Fund will be subject to the risk\nthat any income generated by lending its\nsecurities or reinvesting cash collateral is\nlower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay\na borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute\npayments for dividends when overseeing a\nFund's securities lending activity. Settlement\nRisk . Markets in different countries have\ndifferent clearance and settlement procedures\nand in certain markets there have been times\nwhen settlements have been unable to keep pace\nwith the volume of transactions. Delays in\nsettlement may increase credit risk to a Fund,\nlimit the ability of a Fund to reinvest the\nproceeds of a sale of securities, hinder the\nability of a Fund to lend its portfolio\nsecurities, and potentially subject a Fund to\npenalties for its failure to deliver to on-\npurchasers of securities whose delivery to a\nFund was delayed. Delays in the settlement of\nsecurities purchased by a Fund may limit the\nability of a Fund to sell those securities at\ntimes and prices it considers desirable, and\nmay subject a Fund to losses and costs due to\nits own inability to settle with subsequent\npurchasers of the securities from it. A Fund\nmay be required to borrow monies it had\notherwise expected to receive in connection\nwith the settlement of securities sold by it,\nin order to meet its obligations to others.\nLimits on the ability of a Fund to purchase or\nsell securities due to settlement delays could\nincrease any variance between a Fund's\nperformance and that of its benchmark index.\nTax Exemption Risk. There is no guarantee that\nany of a Fund's income will be exempt from\nfederal or state income taxes. Events\noccurring after the date of issuance of a\nmunicipal bond or after a Fund's acquisition\nof a municipal bond may result in a\ndetermination that interest on that bond is\nincludible in gross income for federal income\ntax purposes retroactively to its date of\nissuance. Such a determination may cause a\nportion of prior distributions by a Fund to\nits shareholders that is attributable to\nmunicipal bonds to be taxable to those\nshareholders in the year of receipt. Federal\nor state changes in income or alternative\nminimum tax rates or in the tax treatment of\nmunicipal bonds may make municipal bonds less\nattractive as investments and cause them to\ndecline in value. Technology Sector Risk .\nMarket or economic factors impacting\ntechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances could have a\nmajor effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. The value of stocks of technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology product cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, government regulation\nand competition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from\nforeign competitors with lower production\ncosts. Technology companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual\nproperty rights, the loss or impairment of\nwhich may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology\nsector may face dramatic and often\nunpredictable changes in growth rates and\ncompetition for the services of qualified\npersonnel. Unconstrained Sector Risk . A Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets\nwithin one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to\ntime. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nU.S. Government Securities Risk . U.S.\ngovernment securities, such as Treasury bills,\nnotes and bonds and mortgage-backed securities\nguaranteed by the Government National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d), are supported by\nthe full faith and credit of the United\nStates; others are supported by the right of\nthe issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury;\nothers are supported by the discretionary\nauthority of the U.S. government to purchase\nthe agency's obligations; and still others are\nsupported only by the credit of the issuing\nagency, instrumentality, or enterprise.\nAlthough U.S. government-sponsored enterprises\nsuch as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage\nCorporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) and the Federal\nNational Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d)\nmay be chartered or sponsored by Congress,\nthey are not funded by Congressional\nappropriations, and their securities are not\nissued by the U.S. Treasury nor supported by\nthe full faith and credit of the U.S.\ngovernment. There is no assurance that the\nU.S. government would provide financial\nsupport to its agencies and instrumentalities\nif not required to do so. In addition, certain\ngovernmental entities have been subject to\nregulatory scrutiny regarding their accounting\npolicies and practices and other concerns that\nmay result in legislation, changes in\nregulatory oversight and/or other consequences\nthat could adversely affect the credit\nquality, availability, or investment character\nof securities issued by these entities. The\nvalue and liquidity of 127 Table of Contents\nU.S. government securities may be affected\nadversely by changes in the ratings of those\nsecurities. Securities issued by the U.S.\nTreasury historically have been considered to\npresent minimal credit risk. The downgrade in\nthe long-term U.S. credit rating by at least\none major rating agency has introduced greater\nuncertainty about the ability of the U.S. to\nrepay its obligations. A further credit rating\ndowngrade or a U.S. credit default could\ndecrease the value and increase the volatility\nof a Fund's investments. U.S. Treasury\nObligations Risk . U.S. Treasury obligations\nmay differ from other fixed income securities\nin their interest rates, maturities, times of\nissuance and other characteristics. Similar to\nother issuers, changes to the financial\ncondition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of a Fund\u2018s\nU.S. Treasury obligations to decline. The\ntotal public debt of the United States as a\npercentage of gross domestic product has grown\nrapidly since the beginning of the recent\nfinancial downturn. Although high debt levels\ndo not necessarily indicate or cause economic\nproblems, they may create certain systemic\nrisks if sound debt management practices are\nnot implemented. A high national debt level\nmay increase market pressures to meet\ngovernment funding needs, which may drive debt\ncost higher and cause a country to sell\nadditional debt, thereby increasing\nrefinancing risk. A high national debt also\nraises concerns that a government will not be\nable to make principal or interest payments\nwhen they are due. In the worst case,\nunsustainable debt levels can cause a decline\nin the value of the dollar (which may lead to\ninflation), and can prevent the U.S.\ngovernment from implementing effective\ncounter-cyclical fiscal policy in economic\ndownturns. U.S. Treasury securities are\ncurrently given the top rating by all major\nratings agencies except Standard & Poor's\nRatings Services, which rates them AA+, one\ngrade below their top rating. Since\ndowngrading U.S. Treasury securities from AAA\nto AA+ in 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings\nServices has affirmed its rating. A downgrade\nof the ratings of U.S. government debt\nobligations, such as U.S. Treasury\nobligations, which are often used as a\nbenchmark for other borrowing arrangements,\ncould result in higher interest rates for\nindividual and corporate borrowers, cause\ndisruptions in the international bond markets\nand have a substantial negative effect on the\nU.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities from another ratings agency or a\nfurther downgrade below AA+ rating by Standard\n& Poor's Ratings Services may cause the value\nof a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to\ndecline. Valuation Risk . Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of a\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. Technological issues or other service\ndisruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause a Fund to value\nits investments incorrectly. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that a Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the\nvalue established for it at any time, and it\nis possible that a Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby a Fund at that time. Variable and Floating\nRate Securities Risk . Variable or floating\nrate securities are debt securities with\nvariable or floating interest rates payments.\nVariable or floating rate securities bear\nrates of interest that are adjusted\nperiodically according to formulae intended\ngenerally to reflect market rates of interest\nand allow a Fund to participate (determined in\naccordance with the terms of the securities)\nin increases in interest rates through upward\nadjustments of the coupon rates on the\nsecurities. However, during periods of\nincreasing interest rates, changes in the\ncoupon rates may lag behind the changes in\nmarket rates or may have limits on the maximum\nincreases in coupon rates. Alternatively,\nduring periods of declining interest rates,\nthe coupon rates on such securities will\ntypically readjust downward resulting in a\nlower yield. A Fund may also invest in\nvariable or floating rate equity securities,\nwhose dividend payments vary based on changes\nin market rates of interest or other factors.\nIn addition, investment in derivative variable\nrate securities, such as inverse floaters,\nwhose rates vary inversely with market rates\nof interest, or range floaters or capped\nfloaters, whose rates are subject to periodic\nor lifetime caps, or in securities that pay a\nrate of interest determined by applying a\nmultiple to the variable rate involves special\nrisks as compared to investment in a fixed-\nrate security and may involve leverage. The\nextent of increases and decreases in the\nvalues of derivative variable rate securities\nand the corresponding change to the net asset\nvalue of the Fund in 128 Table of Contents\nresponse to changes in market rates of\ninterest generally may be larger than\ncomparable changes in the value of an equal\nprincipal amount of a fixed-rate security\nhaving similar credit quality, redemption\nprovisions, and maturity. The markets for such\nsecurities may be less developed and may have\nless liquidity than the markets for\nconventional securities. When-Issued, TBA and\nDelayed Delivery Securities Risk. A Fund may\npurchase securities on a when-issued, TBA or\ndelayed delivery basis and may purchase\nsecurities on a forward commitment basis. The\npurchase price of the securities is typically\nfixed at the time of the commitment, but\ndelivery and payment can take place a month or\nmore after the date of the commitment. The\nprices of the securities so purchased or sold\nare subject to market fluctuations. At the\ntime of delivery of the securities, the value\nmay be more or less than the purchase or sale\nprice. Purchase of securities on a when-\nissued, TBA, delayed delivery, or forward\ncommitment basis may give rise to investment\nleverage, and may result in increased\nvolatility of a Fund's net asset value.\nDefault by, or bankruptcy of, a counterparty\nto a when-issued, TBA or delayed delivery\ntransaction would expose a Fund to possible\nlosses because of an adverse market action,\nexpenses or delays in connection with the\npurchase or sale of the pools specified in\nsuch transaction. Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority, Inc. rules impose\nmandatory margin requirements for certain\ntypes of when-issued, TBA delayed delivery or\nforward commitment transactions, with limited\nexceptions. Such transactions require\nmandatory collateralization which may increase\nthe cost of such transactions and impose added\noperational complexity. Non-Principal Risks\nEach risk discussed below is a non-principal\nrisk of a Fund to the extent it is not\nidentified as a principal risk for such Fund\nin the preceding \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION\n- PRINCIPAL RISKS\u201d section. Authorized\nParticipants, Market Makers and Liquidity\nProviders Concentration Risk. A Fund has a\nlimited number of financial institutions that\nmay act as Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d),\nwhich are responsible for the creation and\nredemption activity for a Fund. In addition,\nthere may be a limited number of market makers\nand/or liquidity providers in the marketplace.\nTo the extent either of the following events\noccur, Fund Shares may trade at a material\ndiscount to NAV and possibly face delisting:\n(i) APs exit the business or otherwise become\nunable to process creation and/or redemption\norders and no other APs step forward to\nperform these services, or (ii) market makers\nand/or liquidity providers exit the business\nor significantly reduce their business\nactivities and no other entities step forward\nto perform their functions. Cash Transaction\nRisk . To the extent that a Fund sells\nportfolio securities to meet some or all of a\nredemption request with cash, the Fund may\nincur taxable gains or losses that it might\nnot have incurred had it made redemptions\nentirely in-kind. As a result, a Fund may pay\nout higher annual capital gain distributions\nthan if the in-kind redemption process was\nused. Concentration Risk. A Fund's assets will\ngenerally be concentrated in an industry or\ngroup of industries to the extent that the\nFund's underlying Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nWhen a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a\nFund will be subject to a number of actual or\npotential conflicts of interest. For example,\nthe Adviser or its affiliates may provide\nservices to a Fund, such as securities lending\nagency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer\nagency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for\nwhich the Fund would compensate the Adviser\nand/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest\nin other pooled investment vehicles sponsored,\nmanaged, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of a\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements. 129 Table of Contents\nThe Adviser and its affiliates serve as\ninvestment adviser to other clients and may\nmake investment decisions that may be\ndifferent from those that will be made by the\nAdviser on behalf of the Funds. For example,\nthe Adviser may provide asset allocation\nadvice to some clients that may include a\nrecommendation to invest in or redeem from\nparticular issuers while not providing that\nsame recommendation to all clients invested in\nthe same or similar issuers. The Adviser may\n(subject to applicable law) be simultaneously\nseeking to purchase (or sell) investments for\na Fund and to sell (or purchase) the same\ninvestment for accounts, funds, or structured\nproducts for which it serves as asset manager,\nor for other clients or affiliates. The\nAdviser and its affiliates may invest for\nclients in various securities that are senior,\npari passuor junior to, or have interests\ndifferent from or adverse to, the securities\nthat are owned by a Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material\nnonpublic confidential information that may\nrestrict the Adviser from purchasing\nsecurities or selling securities for itself or\nits clients (including the Funds) or otherwise\nusing such information for the benefit of its\nclients or itself. The foregoing does not\npurport to be a comprehensive list or complete\nexplanation of all potential conflicts of\ninterests which may affect a Fund. A Fund may\nencounter circumstances, or enter into\ntransactions, in which conflicts of interest\nthat are not listed or discussed above may\narise. Costs of Buying and Selling Shares .\nInvestors buying or selling Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market will pay brokerage\ncommissions or other charges imposed by\nbrokers, as determined by that broker.\nBrokerage commissions are often a fixed amount\nand may be a significant proportional cost for\ninvestors seeking to buy or sell relatively\nsmall amounts of Fund Shares. In addition,\nsecondary market investors will also incur the\ncost of the difference between the price that\nan investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares\n(the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which an\ninvestor is willing to sell Fund Shares (the\n\u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask\nprices is often referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or\n\u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies\nover time for Fund Shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and is generally\nlower if Fund Shares have more trading volume\nand market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares\nhave little trading volume and market\nliquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask\nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,\nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may\nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Counterparty Risk. A Fund\nwill be subject to credit risk with respect to\nthe counterparties with which the Fund enters\ninto derivatives contracts and other\ntransactions such as repurchase agreements or\nreverse repurchase agreements. A Fund's\nability to profit from these types of\ninvestments and transactions will depend on\nthe willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate\nor realize any gain on the investment or\ntransaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund.\nA Fund may experience significant delays in\nobtaining any recovery in an insolvency,\nbankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding\ninvolving its counterparty (including recovery\nof any collateral posted by it) and may obtain\nonly a limited recovery or may obtain no\nrecovery in such circumstances. If a Fund\nholds collateral posted by its counterparty,\nit may be delayed or prevented from realizing\non the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if a Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another institution being\nsubstituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, a\nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the\nfinancial institution's authority, the\nfinancial institution's liabilities could be\nwritten down, eliminated or converted into\nequity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial\ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of securities and, if a Fund\nholds such securities or has entered into a\ntransaction with such a financial security\nwhen a bail-in occurs, such Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, funds (such as the Funds) and their\nservice providers (including the Adviser) may\nbe prone to operational and information\nsecurity risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. In general,\ncyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects.\nCyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from\naccessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, 130 Table of Contents\nand causing operational disruption. Successful\ncyber-attacks against, or security breakdowns\nof, a Fund, the Adviser, a sub-adviser or a\ncustodian, transfer agent, or other affiliated\nor third-party service provider may adversely\naffect a Fund or its shareholders. For\ninstance, cyber-attacks or technical\nmalfunctions may interfere with the processing\nof shareholder or other transactions, affect a\nFund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the\nrelease of private shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial\nlosses, reimbursement or other compensation\ncosts, and additional compliance costs. Cyber-\nattacks or technical malfunctions may render\nrecords of Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and\nother data integral to the functioning of a\nFund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete.\nA Fund may also incur substantial costs for\ncybersecurity risk management in order to\nprevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund\nand its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. While the Adviser and/or\nthe Sub-Adviser have established business\ncontinuity plans and systems designed to\nminimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the\nuse of technology, processes and controls,\nthere are inherent limitations in such plans\nand systems, including the possibility that\ncertain risks have not been identified, given\nthe evolving nature of this threat. Each Fund\nrelies on third-party service providers for\nmany of its day-to-day operations, and will be\nsubject to the risk that the protections and\nprotocols implemented by those service\nproviders will be ineffective to protect the\nFund from cyber-attack. The Adviser does not\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems\nput in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may\nhave limited indemnification obligations to\nthe Adviser or the Funds. Similar types of\ncybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions\nalso are present for issuers of securities in\nwhich each Fund invests, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such\nissuers, and may cause a Fund's investment in\nsuch securities to lose value. Derivatives\nRisk. A derivative is a financial contract the\nvalue of which depends on, or is derived from,\nthe value of an underlying asset, interest\nrate, or index. Derivative transactions\ntypically involve leverage and may have\nsignificant volatility. It is possible that a\nderivative transaction will result in a loss\ngreater than the principal amount invested,\nand a Fund may not be able to close out a\nderivative transaction at a favorable time or\nprice. Risks associated with derivative\ninstruments include potential changes in value\nin response to interest rate changes or other\nmarket developments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential\nfor the derivative transaction not to have the\neffect the Adviser or Sub-Adviser anticipated\nor a different or less favorable effect than\nthe Adviser or Sub-Adviser anticipated; the\nfailure of the counterparty to the derivative\ntransaction to perform its obligations under\nthe transaction or to settle a trade; possible\nmispricing or improper valuation of the\nderivative instrument; imperfect correlation\nin the value of a derivative with the asset,\nrate, or index underlying the derivative; the\nrisk that a Fund may be required to post\ncollateral or margin with its counterparty,\nand will not be able to recover the collateral\nor margin in the event of the counterparty's\ninsolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that a Fund\nwill experience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including without\nlimitation absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to a\nFund due to losses on the transaction and an\nincrease in volatility; the potential for the\nderivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. Index\nConstruction Risk . A security included in an\nIndex may not exhibit the characteristic or\nprovide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently a Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that\ncharacteristic or exposure. Index Licensing\nRisk . It is possible that the license under\nwhich the Adviser or a Fund is permitted to\nreplicate or otherwise use an Index will be\nterminated or may be disputed, impaired or\ncease to remain in effect. In such a case, the\nAdviser may be required to replace the\nrelevant Index with another index which it\nconsiders to be appropriate in light of the\ninvestment strategy of a Fund. The use of any\nsuch substitute index may have an adverse\nimpact on a Fund's performance. In the event\nthat the Adviser is unable to identify a\nsuitable replacement for the relevant Index,\nit may determine to terminate a Fund.\nLeveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,\nreverse repurchase agreements, certain\nderivatives transactions, securities lending\ntransactions and other investment transactions\nsuch as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or\nforward commitment transactions may create\ninvestment leverage. If a Fund engages in\ntransactions that have a leveraging effect on\nthe Fund's investment portfolio, the value of\nthe Fund will be potentially more volatile and\nall other risks will tend to be compounded.\nThis is because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than a 131 Table of Contents Fund\nwould otherwise have and so magnifies the\neffect of any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of the Fund's underlying assets. The use\nof leverage is considered to be a speculative\ninvestment practice and may result in losses\nto a Fund. Certain derivatives have the\npotential for unlimited loss, regardless of\nthe size of the initial investment. The use of\nleverage may cause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to\ndo so to satisfy repayment, interest payment,\nor margin obligations or to meet asset\nsegregation or coverage requirements.\nLiquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk\nthat a Fund may not be able to dispose of\nsecurities or close out derivatives\ntransactions readily at a favorable time or\nprices (or at all) or at prices approximating\nthose at which a Fund currently values them.\nFor example, certain investments may be\nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade\nin the over-the-counter market or in limited\nvolume, or may not have an active trading\nmarket. Illiquid securities may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for a Fund to value illiquid\nsecurities accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. Disposal of illiquid\nsecurities may entail registration expenses\nand other transaction costs that are higher\nthan those for liquid securities. A Fund may\nseek to borrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of\nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing\nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund.\nMoney Market Risk . An investment in a money\nmarket fund is not a deposit of any bank and\nis not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or\nany other government agency. Certain money\nmarket funds seek to preserve the value of\ntheir shares at $1.00 per share, although\nthere can be no assurance that they will do\nso, and it is possible to lose money by\ninvesting in such a money market fund. A major\nor unexpected change in interest rates or a\ndecline in the credit quality of an issuer or\nentity providing credit support, an inactive\ntrading market for money market instruments,\nor adverse market, economic, industry,\npolitical, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause the share price of such\na money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will\nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at\ntimes when the fair value of the money market\nfund's portfolio per share is more or less\nthan $1.00. None of the State Street Entities\nguarantee the value of an investment in a\nmoney market fund at $1.00 per share.\nInvestors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market\nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV\nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the\nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or\nless than their original purchase price.\nRecent changes in the regulation of money\nmarket funds may affect the operations and\nstructures of money market funds. A money\nmarket fund may be permitted or required to\nimpose redemption fees or to impose\nlimitations on redemptions during periods of\nhigh illiquidity in the markets for the\ninvestments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . A Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to a Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nhave the effect of reducing a Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. A Fund may engage in frequent\ntrading of its portfolio securities in\nconnection with Index rebalancing. Frequent\ntrading may cause a Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent trading. Securities\nLending Risk. Each Fund may lend portfolio\nsecurities in an amount not to exceed 40% of\nthe value of its net assets. For these\npurposes, net assets shall exclude the value\nof all assets received as collateral for the\nloan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by a\nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a\nloan transaction, as compensation for lending\nits securities, a Fund will receive a portion\nof the dividends or interest accrued on the\nsecurities held as collateral or, in the case\nof cash collateral, a portion of the income\nfrom the investment of such cash. In addition,\na Fund will receive the amount of all\ndividends, interest and other distributions on\nthe loaned securities. However, the borrower\nhas the right to vote the loaned securities. A\nFund will call loans to vote proxies if a\nmaterial issue affecting the investment is to\nbe voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities, and may involve expenses to\na Fund. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. Should the borrower of the securities\nfail financially, a Fund may experience delays\nin recovering the securities or exercising its\nrights in the collateral. Loans are 132 Table\nof Contents made only to borrowers that are\ndeemed by the securities lending agent to be\nof good financial standing. In a loan\ntransaction, a Fund will also bear the risk of\nany decline in value of securities provided as\ncollateral or acquired with cash collateral.\nEach Fund will attempt to minimize this risk\nby limiting the investment of cash collateral\nto high quality instruments of short maturity\neither directly on behalf of the lending Fund\nor through one or more joint accounts or\nfunds, which may include those managed by the\nAdviser. To the extent the collateral provided\nor investments made with cash collateral\ndiffer from securities included in an Index,\nsuch collateral or investments may have a\ngreater risk of loss than the securities\nincluded in the Index. In addition, a Fund\nwill be subject to the risk that any income\ngenerated by lending its securities or\nreinvesting cash collateral is lower than any\nfees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower.\nThe Adviser will take into account the tax\nimpact to shareholders of substitute payments\nfor dividends when overseeing a Fund's\nsecurities lending activity. Trading Issues .\nAlthough Fund Shares are listed for trading on\nthe Exchange and may be listed or traded on\nU.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than\nthe Exchange, there can be no assurance that\nan active trading market for such Fund Shares\nwill develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange may be halted due to\nmarket conditions or for reasons that, in the\nview of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange is subject to\ntrading halts caused by extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit\nbreaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock\nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While each Fund expects that the\nability of Authorized Participants to create\nand redeem Fund Shares at net asset value\nshould be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of a Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. 133\n\nTable of Contents\n\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to each Fund and,\nsubject to the oversight of the Board, is\nresponsible for the investment management of\neach Fund. The Adviser provides an investment\nmanagement program for each Fund and manages\nthe investment of each Fund's assets. The\nAdviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State\nStreet Global Advisors, Inc., which itself is\na wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation.

The contractual fee waiver   \n       does not provide for the recoupment    \n       by the Adviser of any fees the         \n       Adviser previously waived. The         \n       Adviser may continue the waiver from   \n       year to year, but there is no          \n       guarantee that the Adviser will do so  \n       and after October 31, 2021, any or     \n       all waivers may be cancelled or        \n       modified at any time.

The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The\nExchange may close early on the business day\nbefore certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules\nare subject to change without notice. If you\nbuy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you will pay the secondary market\nprice for Fund Shares. In addition, you may\nincur customary brokerage commissions and\ncharges and may pay some or all of the spread\nbetween the bid and the offered price in the\nsecondary market on each leg of a round trip\n(purchase and sale) transaction. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares will fluctuate\ncontinuously throughout trading hours based on\nmarket supply and demand rather than the\nrelevant Fund's net asset value, which is\ncalculated for each Fund other than the SPDR\nBloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF once daily as\nof the close of the regular trading session on\nthe NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time)\non each day that such exchange is open. With\nrespect to the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 1-3\nMonth T-Bill ETF, the Fund's net asset value\nis calculated twice daily on each day the NYSE\nis open at the following times: (i) 12:00 p.m.\nEastern time; and (ii) at the close of the\nregular trading session on the NYSE. Fund\nShares will trade on the Exchange at prices\nthat may be above ( i.e., at a premium) or\nbelow ( i.e., at a discount), to varying\ndegrees, the calculated net asset value of\nFund Shares. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nmay deviate significantly from the relevant\nFund's net asset value during periods of\nmarket volatility. Given, however, that Fund\nShares can be issued and redeemed daily in\nCreation Units, the Adviser believes that\nlarge discounts and premiums to net asset\nvalue should not be sustained over long\nperiods. The Exchange will disseminate, every\nfifteen seconds during the regular trading\nday, an indicative optimized portfolio value\n(\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to each Fund. The IOPV\ncalculations are estimates of the value of\neach Fund's net asset value per Fund Share.\nPremiums and discounts between the IOPV and\nthe market price may occur. This should not be\nviewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net\nasset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is based\non the current market value of the published\nbasket of portfolio securities and/or cash\nrequired to be deposited in exchange for a\nCreation Unit and does not necessarily reflect\nthe precise composition of a Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. The IOPV price is\nbased on quotes and closing prices from the\nsecurities' local market converted into U.S.\ndollars at the current currency rates and 141\nTable of Contents may not reflect events that\noccur subsequent to the local market's close.\nTherefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best\npossible valuation of a Fund's current\nportfolio. Neither the Funds nor the Adviser\nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or\nresponsible for, the calculation or\ndissemination of such IOPVs and make no\nwarranty as to their accuracy. The Funds do\nnot impose any restrictions on the frequency\nof purchases and redemptions; however, the\nFunds reserve the right to reject or limit\npurchases at any time as described in the SAI.\nWhen considering that no restriction or policy\nwas necessary, the Board evaluated the risks\nposed by market timing activities, such as\nwhether frequent purchases and redemptions\nwould interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of a Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause a Fund\nto experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional\nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and\nredeemed only in large quantities of shares\nknown as Creation Units, available only from a\nFund directly, and that most trading in a Fund\noccurs on the Exchange at prevailing market\nprices and does not involve the Fund directly.\nGiven this structure, the Board determined\nthat it is unlikely that (a) market timing\nwould be attempted by a Fund's shareholders or\n(b) any attempts to market time a Fund by\nshareholders would result in negative impact\nto the Fund or its shareholders. Distributions\nDividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund\nshareholder, you are entitled to your share of\nthe applicable Fund's income and net realized\ngains on its investments. Each Fund pays out\nsubstantially all of its net earnings to its\nshareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d Each Fund may\nearn interest from debt securities and, if\nparticipating, securities lending income. In\naddition, the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays\nConvertible Securities ETF may earn dividend\nincome from preferred securities. These\namounts, net of expenses and taxes (if\napplicable), are passed along to Fund\nshareholders as \u201cincome dividend\ndistributions.\u201d Each Fund will generally\nrealize short-term capital gains or losses\nwhenever it sells or exchanges assets held for\none year or less. Net short-term capital gains\nwill generally be treated as ordinary income\nwhen distributed to shareholders. Each Fund\nwill generally realize long-term capital gains\nor losses whenever it sells or exchanges\nassets held for more than one year. Net\ncapital gains (the excess of a Fund's net\nlong-term capital gains over its net short-\nterm capital losses) are distributed to\nshareholders as \u201ccapital gain distributions.\u201d\nIncome dividend distributions, if any, are\ngenerally distributed to shareholders monthly,\nbut may vary significantly from period to\nperiod. Net capital gains for each Fund are\ndistributed at least annually. Dividends may\nbe declared and paid more frequently or at any\nother time to improve Index tracking or to\ncomply with the distribution requirements of\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(the \u201cCode\u201d). A portion of each distribution\nmay result in a return of capital. You will be\nnotified regarding the portion of the\ndistribution which represents a return of\ncapital. Distributions in cash may be\nreinvested automatically in additional whole\nFund Shares only if the broker through whom\nyou purchased Fund Shares makes such option\navailable. Distributions which are reinvested\nwill nevertheless be taxable to the same\nextent as if such distributions had not been\nreinvested. Portfolio Holdings Disclosure The\nFunds' portfolio holdings disclosure policy is\ndescribed in the SAI. In addition, the\nidentities and quantities of the securities\nheld by each Fund are disclosed on the Funds'\nwebsite. Additional Tax Information The\nfollowing discussion is a summary of some\nimportant U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in a Fund. Your investment in a\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes On Distributions\n(Municipal Bond ETFs only). Dividends paid by\na Municipal Bond ETF that are reported as\nexempt-interest dividends will not be subject\nto regular federal income tax. Each Municipal\nBond ETF intends to invest its assets in a\nmanner such that dividend distributions to its\nshareholders will generally be exempt from\nregular U.S. federal income tax, although\ndistributions from Municipal Bond ETFs may be\nsubject to the federal alternative minimum tax\nand will not necessarily be exempt from state\nand local taxation. Dividends paid by a\nMunicipal Bond ETF will be 142 Table of\nContents exempt from regular federal income\ntax to the extent of such Fund's net tax-\nexempt interest income as long as 50% or more\nof the value of such Fund's assets at the end\nof each quarter is invested in state,\nmunicipal and other bonds the interest on\nwhich is excluded from gross income for\nfederal income tax purposes and as long as\nsuch Fund reports such dividends as exempt-\ninterest dividends. Each Municipal Bond ETF,\nhowever, is able to invest up to 20% of its\nnet assets in taxable securities, the income\nfrom which is subject to regular federal\nincome tax. Because a Municipal Bond ETF may\ninvest in private activity bonds (within the\nmeaning of Section 141 of the Code), the\ninterest on which is not federally tax-exempt\nto persons who are \u201csubstantial users\u201d of the\nfacilities financed by such bonds or \u201crelated\npersons\u201d of such \u201csubstantial users,\u201d a\nMunicipal Bond ETF may not be an appropriate\ninvestment for shareholders who are considered\neither a \u201csubstantial user\u201d or \u201crelated\nperson\u201d within the meaning of the Code. In\naddition, interest on certain municipal\nsecurities that meet the definition of private\nactivity bonds under the Code is included as\nan item of tax preference in determining the\namount of a taxpayer's alternative minimum\ntaxable income. To the extent a Municipal Bond\nETF receives income from private activity\nbonds, a portion of the dividends paid by it,\nalthough otherwise exempt from federal income\ntax, will be taxable to those shareholders\nsubject to the alternative minimum tax regime.\nEach Municipal Bond ETF will annually supply\nshareholders with a report indicating the\npercentage of its income attributable to\nmunicipal securities required to be included\nin calculating the federal alternative minimum\ntax. Exempt-interest dividends from a\nMunicipal Bond ETF are taken into account in\ndetermining the taxable portion of any Social\nSecurity or railroad retirement benefits that\nyou receive. If you receive Social Security or\nrailroad retirement benefits, you should\nconsult your tax advisor about how an\ninvestment in a Municipal Bond ETF may affect\nthe taxation of your benefits. Exempt-interest\ndividends attributable to interest on\nmunicipal securities issued by a state or its\npolitical subdivisions may be exempt in the\nhands of a shareholder from income tax imposed\nby that state, but exempt-interest dividends\nattributable to interest on municipal\nsecurities issued by another state generally\nwill not be exempt from such income tax. All\nFunds. In general, your distributions (other\nthan exempt-interest dividends) are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in a\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from\nthe Funds will generally be taxed as ordinary\nincome. Subject to certain limitations,\ndividends that are reported by a Fund as\nqualified dividend income are taxable to\nnoncorporate shareholders at rates of up to\n20%. Any distributions of a Fund's net capital\ngains are taxable as long-term capital gain\nregardless of how long you have owned Fund\nShares. Long-term capital gains are generally\ntaxed to noncorporate shareholders at rates of\nup to 20%. Although the Municipal Bond ETFs do\nnot seek to realize taxable income or capital\ngains, they may realize and distribute taxable\nincome or capital gains from time to time as a\nresult of their normal investment activities.\nDistributions in excess of a Fund's current\nand accumulated earnings and profits are\ntreated as a tax-free return of capital to the\nextent of your basis in the applicable Fund's\nshares, and, in general, as capital gain\nthereafter. In general, dividends may be\nreported by a Fund as qualified dividend\nincome if they are attributable to qualified\ndividend income received by the Fund, which,\nin general, includes dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations and certain foreign\ncorporations ( i.e., certain foreign\ncorporations incorporated in a possession of\nthe United States or in certain countries with\na comprehensive tax treaty with the United\nStates, and certain other foreign corporations\nif the stock with respect to which the\ndividend is paid is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the United\nStates), provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements in respect\nof the stock of such corporations and has not\nhedged its position in the stock in certain\nways. A dividend generally will not be treated\nas qualified dividend income if the dividend\nis received with respect to any share of stock\nheld by a Fund for fewer than 61 days during\nthe 121-day period beginning at the date which\nis 60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, for fewer than 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning 90 days before such\ndate. These holding period requirements will\nalso apply to your ownership of Fund Shares.\nHolding periods may be suspended for these\npurposes for stock that is hedged. SPDR\nBloomberg Barclays Convertible Securities ETF\nmay hold common stock or preferred securities.\nThus, SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Convertible\nSecurities ETF may report a portion of its\ndistributions as qualified dividend income.\nSince the other Funds primarily hold\ninvestments that do not pay dividends, it is\nnot expected that a 143 Table of Contents\nsubstantial portion of the dividends paid by\nthose other Funds will qualify for either the\ndividends-received deduction for corporations\nor the favorable income tax rates available to\nindividuals on qualified dividend income.\nAdditionally, dividends paid on fund shares on\nloan will not be treated as qualified dividend\nincome. U.S. individuals with income exceeding\nspecified thresholds are subject to a 3.8%\nMedicare contribution tax on all or a portion\nof their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which\nincludes taxable interest, dividends and\ncertain capital gains (generally including\ncapital gain distributions and capital gains\nrealized upon the sale of Fund Shares) but\ndoes not include exempt-interest dividends\npaid by Municipal Bond ETFs. This 3.8% tax\nalso applies to all or a portion of the\nundistributed net investment income of certain\nshareholders that are estates and trusts.\nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions\nwill be subject to a 1.4% tax on net\ninvestment income. For these purposes, certain\ndividends and capital gain distributions (but\nnot exempt-interest dividends paid by\nMunicipal Bond ETFs), and certain gains from\nthe disposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. If you lend your Fund\nShares pursuant to securities lending\narrangements you may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares are\nheld by the borrower) as qualified dividend\nincome. You should consult your financial\nintermediary or tax advisor to discuss your\nparticular circumstances. Distributions paid\nin January, but declared by a Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year,\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth, may be taxable to you in the calendar\nyear in which they were declared. The Funds\nwill inform you of the amount of your ordinary\nincome dividends, capital gain distributions\nand any qualified dividend income shortly\nafter the close of each calendar year. A\ndistribution will reduce a Fund's net asset\nvalue per Fund Share and may be taxable to you\nas ordinary income or capital gain even\nthough, from an investment standpoint, the\ndistribution may constitute a return of\ncapital. Original Issue Discount . Investments\nby a Fund in zero coupon or other discount\nsecurities will result in income to the Fund\nequal to a portion of the excess face value of\nthe securities over their issue price (the\n\u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or \u201cOID\u201d) each year\nthat the securities are held, even though the\nFund may receive no cash interest payments or\nmay receive cash interest payments that are\nless than the income recognized for tax\npurposes. In other circumstances, whether\npursuant to the terms of a security or as a\nresult of other factors outside the control of\na Fund, a Fund may recognize income without\nreceiving a commensurate amount of cash. A\nFund\u2018s share of such income is included in\ndetermining the amount that the Fund must\ndistribute to maintain its eligibility for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand to avoid the payment of federal tax,\nincluding the nondeductible 4% excise tax.\nBecause any income required to be recognized\nas a result of the OID and/or market discount\nrules (discussed below) may not be matched by\na corresponding cash payment, the Fund may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand eliminate taxes at the Fund level.\nInflation-Indexed Bonds. Special rules apply\nif a Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds.\nGenerally, all stated interest on inflation-\nindexed bonds is taken into income by a Fund\nunder its regular method of accounting for\ninterest income. The amount of any positive\ninflation adjustment for a taxable year, which\nresults from an increase in the inflation-\nadjusted principal amount of the bond, is\ntreated as OID. The amount of a Fund's OID in\na taxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund's taxable income for such\nyear without a corresponding receipt of cash\nuntil the bond matures. As a result, a Fund\nmay need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for such\nyear. The amount of any negative inflation\nadjustments, which result from a decrease in\nthe inflation-adjusted principal amount of the\nbond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market\ndiscount, if any) otherwise includible in a\nFund's income with respect to the bond for the\ntaxable year; any remaining negative\nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary\nloss or, in certain circumstances, carried\nforward to reduce the amount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the\nbond in future taxable years. Market Discount\n(For Securities Other Than Municipal\nSecurities). Any market discount recognized on\na market discount bond is taxable as ordinary\nincome. A market discount bond is a bond\nacquired in the secondary market at a price\nbelow redemption value or below adjusted issue\nprice if the bond was issued with original\nissue discount. Absent an election by a Fund\nto include the market discount in income as it\naccrues, the gain on the Fund's disposition of\nsuch an obligation will be treated as ordinary\nincome rather than capital gain to the extent\nof the accrued market discount. Where the\nincome required to be recognized as a result\nof the market discount rules is not matched by\na 144 Table of Contents corresponding cash\nreceipt by the Fund, the Fund may be required\nto borrow money or dispose of securities to\nenable the Fund to make distributions to its\nshareholders in order to qualify for treatment\nas a regulated investment company and\neliminate taxes at the Fund level, potentially\nresulting in additional taxable gain or loss\nto the Fund. Market Discount (Municipal\nSecurities). If a Municipal Bond ETF purchases\na municipal security at a market discount, any\ngain realized by the Municipal Bond ETF upon\nsale or redemption of the municipal security\nwill be treated as taxable interest income to\nthe extent of the market discount, and any\ngain realized in excess of the market discount\nwill be treated as capital gains. Derivatives\nand Other Complex Securities. A Fund may\ninvest in complex securities. These\ninvestments may be subject to numerous special\nand complex rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngain, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund and/or defer a Fund's ability to\nrecognize losses. In turn, these rules may\naffect the amount, timing or character of the\nincome distributed to you by a Fund. You\nshould consult your personal tax advisor\nregarding the application of these rules.\nForeign Currency Transactions. A Fund's\ntransactions in foreign currencies, foreign\ncurrency denominated debt obligations and\ncertain foreign currency options, futures\ncontracts and forward contracts (and similar\ninstruments) may give rise to ordinary income\nor loss to the extent such income or loss\nresults from fluctuations in the value of the\nforeign currency concerned. Foreign Income\nTaxes. Investment income received by a Fund\nfrom sources within foreign countries may be\nsubject to foreign income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The United States has entered into\ntax treaties with many foreign countries which\nmay entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of such\ntaxes or exemption from taxes on such income.\nIt is impossible to determine the effective\nrate of foreign tax for a Fund in advance\nsince the amount of the assets to be invested\nwithin various countries is not known. If more\nthan 50% of the total assets of a Fund at the\nclose of its taxable year consist of certain\nforeign stocks or securities, the Fund may\nelect to \u201cpass through\u201d to you certain foreign\nincome taxes (including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund. If a Fund in which you hold\nFund Shares makes such an election, you will\nbe considered to have received as an\nadditional dividend your share of such foreign\ntaxes, but you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income, or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not so elect, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a deduction for\ncertain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund.\nUnder certain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign taxes paid in\nrespect of a prior year, the value of Fund\nShares could be affected or any foreign tax\ncredits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign\ntaxes for the current year could be reduced.\nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund Shares is generally treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for more than one year and as short-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for one year or less, except that any\ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held\nfor six months or less is treated as long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to such Fund\nShares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of\nCreation Units. A person who exchanges\nsecurities for Creation Units generally will\nrecognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss\nwill be equal to the difference between the\nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time\nand the exchanger's aggregate basis in the\nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for\nthe Creation Units. A person who exchanges\nCreation Units for securities will generally\nrecognize a gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the exchanger's basis in\nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The IRS, however, may assert that a\nloss realized upon an exchange of securities\nfor Creation Units cannot be deducted\ncurrently under the rules governing \u201cwash\nsales,\u201d or on the basis that there has been no\nsignificant change in economic position.\nPersons exchanging securities should consult\ntheir own tax advisor with respect to whether\nwash sale rules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. Under current federal tax laws,\nany capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for\nmore than one year and as a short-term capital\ngain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for one\nyear or less. 145 Table of Contents If you\ncreate or redeem Creation Units, you will be\nsent a confirmation statement showing how many\nFund Shares you purchased or sold and at what\nprice. The Trust on behalf of each Fund has\nthe right to reject an order for Creation\nUnits if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund and\nif, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the\napplicable Fund would have a basis in the\nsecurities different from the market value of\nthe securities on the date of deposit. The\nTrust also has the right to require\ninformation necessary to determine beneficial\nshare ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund, the\npurchaser (or group of purchasers) will not\nrecognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If a Fund\nredeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear\nadditional costs and recognize more capital\ngains than it would if it redeems Creation\nUnits in-kind. Certain Tax-Exempt Investors. A\nFund, if investing in certain limited real\nestate investments and other publicly traded\npartnerships, may be required to pass through\ncertain \u201cexcess inclusion income\u201d and other\nincome as \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d\n(\u201cUBTI\u201d). Prior to investing in a Fund, tax-\nexempt investors sensitive to UBTI should\nconsult their tax advisors regarding this\nissue and IRS pronouncements addressing the\ntreatment of such income in the hands of such\ninvestors. Non-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income\ndividends paid by a Fund to shareholders who\nare non-resident aliens or foreign entities\nwill generally be subject to a 30% U.S.\nwithholding tax (other than distributions\nreported by the Fund as interest-related\ndividends and short-term capital gain\ndividends), unless a lower treaty rate applies\nor unless such income is effectively connected\nwith a U.S. trade or business. In general, a\nFund may report interest-related dividends to\nthe extent of its net income derived from U.S.\nsource interest and a Fund may report short-\nterm capital gain dividends to the extent its\nnet short-term capital gain for the taxable\nyear exceeds its net long-term capital loss.\nGains on the sale of Fund Shares and dividends\nthat are, in each case, effectively connected\nwith the conduct of a trade or business within\nthe U.S. will generally be subject to U.S.\nfederal net income taxation at regular income\ntax rates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of a\nFund's shares are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment. Unless certain\nnon-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply\nwith IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding\nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions payable to such\nentities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt\nfrom the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund will be\nrequired in certain cases to withhold (as\n\u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts (including\nexempt-interest dividends) payable to any\nshareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States.\nOther Tax Issues. A Fund may be subject to tax\nin certain states where the Fund does business\n(or is treated as doing business as a result\nof its investments). Furthermore, in those\nstates which have income tax laws, the tax\ntreatment of the Funds and of Fund\nshareholders with respect to distributions by\nthe Funds may differ from federal tax\ntreatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes\nsome of the consequences under current federal\nincome tax law of an investment in the Funds.\nIt is not a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. Consult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax consequences of an\ninvestment in the Funds under all applicable\ntax laws. 146 Table of Contents General\nInformation The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nIf shareholders of any Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled\nto one vote for each Fund Share they own.\nAnnual meetings of shareholders will not be\nheld except as required by the 1940 Act and\nother applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization Each\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. For purposes of the 1940\nAct, Fund Shares are issued by the respective\nseries of the Trust and the acquisition of\nFund Shares by investment companies is subject\nto the restrictions of Section 12(d)(1) of the\n1940 Act. The Trust has received exemptive\nrelief from Section 12(d)(1) to allow\nregistered investment companies to invest in\nthe Funds beyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions as set forth in an SEC exemptive\norder issued to the Trust, including that such\ninvestment companies enter into an agreement\nwith the Trust. From time to time, a Fund may\nadvertise yield and total return figures.\nYield is a historical measure of dividend\nincome, and total return is a measure of past\ndividend income (assuming that it has been\nreinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither\nyield nor total return should be used to\npredict the future performance of a Fund.\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel\nto the Trust, including the Funds. Ernst &\nYoung LLP serves as the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and will audit the\nFunds' financial statements annually.\nFinancial Highlights These financial highlight\ntables are intended to help you understand\neach Fund's financial performance for the past\nfive fiscal years. Certain information\nreflects the performance results for a single\nFund Share. The total returns in the table\nrepresent the rate that an investor would have\nearned (or lost) on an investment in each Fund\n(assuming reinvestment of all dividends and\ndistributions). This information has been\naudited by Ernst & Young LLP, the Trust's\nindependent registered public accounting firm,\nwhose report, along with each Fund's financial\nhighlights and financial statements, is\nincluded in the annual report to shareholders,\nwhich is available upon request. Any\nreferences to Notes in these financial\nhighlight tables refer to the \u201cNotes to\nFinancial Statements\u201d section of each Fund's\nfinancial statements, and the financial\ninformation

because of the timing of sales  \n       and repurchases of Fund shares in      \n       relation to fluctuating market values  \n       for the Fund.                          \n  (c)  Amount is less

day of each    \n       period reported.

October 16, 2017, the SPDR          \n       Portfolio Long Term Treasury ETF       \n       underwent a 2-for-1 share split.       \n       The per share data presented here      \n       have been

\n       Per share numbers have been            \n       calculated using average shares        \n  (b)  outstanding, which more appropriately  \n       presents the per share data for the    \n

                       \n  (d)  Amount is less than $0.005 per share.  \n       Total return is calculated assuming a  \n       purchase of shares at net asset value  \n       on the first day and a sale at net     \n       asset value on the last day of each    \n       period reported. Distributions are     \n       assumed, for the purpose of this       \n  (e)  calculation, to be reinvested at net   \n       asset value per share on the           \n       respective payment dates of each       \n       distribution. Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized. Broker commission charges  \n       are not included in this calculation.  \n       Portfolio turnover rate excludes       \n  (f)  securities received or delivered from  \n       in-kind processing

The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same.

These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 261%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy\nThe Fund seeks to\ntrack, before fees and\nexpenses, the\nperformance of the\nIndex. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in\nsecurities comprising\nthe Dorsey Wright\nFixed Income\nAllocation Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d). The Index is\ncomprised of exchange-\ntraded funds advised\nby SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, or\nits affiliates. The\nFund is a \u201cfund of\nfunds,\u201d meaning that\nit invests its assets\nin other exchange-\ntraded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d)\neligible for inclusion\nin the Index rather\nthan in securities of\nindividual companies.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay invest in cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). The\nIndex is owned and\ndeveloped by Dorsey,\nWright & Associates\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d)\nand is constructed\npursuant to the Index\nProvider's proprietary\nmethodology (the\n\u201cMethodology\u201d). The\nselection universe for\nthe Index (the\n\u201cSelection Universe\u201d)\nincludes U.S.-listed\nfixed income ETFs\nadvised by SSGA FM or\nits affiliates (\u201cSPDR\nETFs\u201d) that are\ndesigned to target\nexposure to fixed\nincome securities,\nincluding U.S. and\nnon-U.S. developed and\nemerging market bonds,\ntreasury bonds,\ncorporate bonds, high\nyield bonds,\ninflation-protected\nbonds, floating rate\nnotes, first lien\nsenior secured\nfloating rate bank\nloans, U.S.\nnonconvertible\npreferred stock and\nother preferred\nsecurities, U.S.\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\nmunicipal bonds and\nU.S. convertible\nsecurities. As of July\n31, 2020, the\nSelection Universe\nconsisted of: SPDR\nBloomberg Barclays 1-3\nMonth T-Bill ETF, SPDR\nPortfolio Aggregate\nBond ETF, SPDR\nBloomberg Barclays\nConvertible Securities\nETF, SPDR Bloomberg\nBarclays Emerging\nMarkets Local Bond\nETF, SPDR Bloomberg\nBarclays High Yield\nBond ETF, SPDR\nPortfolio Intermediate\nTerm Corporate Bond\nETF, SPDR Portfolio\nIntermediate Term\nTreasury ETF, SPDR\nBloomberg Barclays\nInternational\nCorporate Bond ETF,\nSPDR Bloomberg\nBarclays International\nTreasury Bond ETF,\nSPDR Bloomberg\nBarclays Investment\nGrade Floating Rate\nETF, SPDR Portfolio\nLong Term Corporate\nBond ETF, SPDR\nPortfolio Long Term\nTreasury ETF, SPDR\nPortfolio Mortgage\nBacked Bond ETF, SPDR\nPortfolio Short Term\nCorporate Bond ETF,\nSPDR Bloomberg\nBarclays Short Term\nInternational Treasury\nBond ETF, SPDR\nPortfolio TIPS ETF,\nSPDR Blackstone / GSO\nSenior Loan ETF, SPDR\nNuveen Bloomberg\nBarclays Municipal\nBond ETF, SPDR Nuveen\nBloomberg Barclays\nShort Term Municipal\nBond ETF, SPDR FTSE\nInternational\nGovernment Inflation-\nProtected Bond ETF and\nSPDR Wells Fargo\nPreferred Stock ETF,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. The Index is\ndesigned to provide\ntargeted exposure to\nthe four SPDR ETFs\nthat offer the\ngreatest potential to\noutperform the other\nSPDR ETFs in the\nSelection Universe.\nThe Methodology ranks\neach SPDR ETF in the\nSelection Universe by\nrelative strength and\nselects the four top-\nranked SPDR ETFs for\ninclusion in the\nIndex. A SPDR ETF's\n\u201crelative strength\u201d is\nthe measurement of its\nprice momentum as\ncompared to the price\nmomentum of all other\nSPDR ETFs in the\nSelection Universe,\nbased on historical\ndaily closing prices\ninclusive of\ndividends, since\ninception, of each\nSPDR ETF in the\nuniverse. A SPDR ETF's\nrelative strength can\nimprove if its\nhistorical daily\nclosing prices\ninclusive of dividends\nrise more than the\nother SPDR ETFs in the\nSelection Universe in\nan uptrend, or go down\nless than the other\nSPDR ETFs in the\nuniverse in a\ndowntrend. The Index\nis initially equal\nweighted, with each\nconstituent SPDR ETF\nrepresenting 25% of\nthe Index's weight.\nThe Index is evaluated\non a weekly basis. An\nIndex component will\nonly be removed if its\nrelative strength\nranking falls below an\nacceptable threshold\nbased on the Index\nProvider's ranking\nmethodology. A SPDR\nETF is only added to\nthe Index when a\ncurrent Index\ncomponent is removed.\nWhen an Index\ncomponent is removed,\nthe SPDR ETF with the\nstrongest relative\nstrength not currently\nincluded in the Index\ntakes its place within\nthe Index. When there\nis a change to the\ncomponents of the\nIndex, the Index is\nrebalanced over a\nperiod of three\nbusiness days (the\n\u201cRebalancing Period\u201d)\nso that each\nconstituent SPDR ETF\nis equally weighted at\n25% of the Index's\nweight on the third,\nand final, business\nday of the Rebalancing\nPeriod. The Fund may\nengage in frequent\ntrading of its\nportfolio securities\nin connection with\nIndex rebalancings.\nThe identities and\nquantities of the\nsecurities held by the\nFund are disclosed on\na daily basis on the\nFund's website at http\ns://www.ssga.com/spdrs\n. The Index is\nsponsored by Dorsey,\nWright & Associates,\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. The Index\nProvider has retained\nThe NASDAQ OMX \u00aeGroup,\nInc. to calculate and\nmaintain the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of\nInvesting in the Fund\nAs with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment\nagency.General risks\nassociated with the\nFund's and the SPDR\nETFs' investment\npolicies and\ninvestment strategies\nare discussed below.\nYou will find\nadditional information\nabout each SPDR ETF's\nrisks in its\nprospectus and SAI.\nReferences to \u201cFund\u201d\nwithin a risk\ndiscussed below should\nalso be read to refer\nto one or more SPDR\nETFs where the context\nrequires. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may\nincrease or decrease\nas a result of the\nfollowing: market\nfluctuations, changes\nin interest rates,\nactual or perceived\ninability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or\nilliquidity in debt\nsecurities markets;\nthe risk of low rates\nof return due to\nreinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by 2 Table\nof Contents issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling\ninterest rates. To the\nextent that interest\nrates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities to\ndecrease, an adverse\nimpact on the\nliquidity of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities, and\nincreased volatility\nof the fixed income ma\nrkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates\nare at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). If\ntheprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes\nin interest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values\nof debt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the\nreturns on other\ninvestment options,\nincluding investments\nin equity securities.\nAffiliated ETF Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in an\naffiliated underlying\nETF, the Fund's\ninvestment performance\nand risks may be\ndirectly related to\nthe investment\nperformance and risks\nof the affiliated ETF.\nIn addition, the\nAdviser may have an\nincentive to take into\naccount the effect on\nan affiliated ETF in\nwhich the Fund may\ninvest in determining\nwhether, and under\nwhat circumstances, to\npurchase or sell\nshares in that\naffiliated ETF.\nAlthough the Adviser\ntakes steps to address\nthe conflicts of\ninterest, it is\npossible that the\nconflicts could impact\nthe Fund. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines. Below\nInvestment-Grade\nSecurities Risk:\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities (\u201chigh\nyield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d\nbonds) are considered\npredominantly\nspeculative, and can\ninvolve a\nsubstantially greater\nrisk of default than\nhigher quality debt\nsecurities. Issuers of\nlower-quality debt\nsecurities may have\nsubstantially greater\nrisk of insolvency or\nbankruptcy than\nissuers of higher-\nquality debt\nsecurities. They can\nbe illiquid, and their\nvalues can have\nsignificant volatility\nand may decline\nsignificantly over\nshort periods of time.\nLower-quality debt\nsecurities tend to be\nmore sensitive to\nadverse news about the\nissuer, or the market\nor economy in general.\nConvertible Securities\nRisk: Convertible\nsecurities may be\nsubordinate to other\ndebt securities issued\nby the same issuer.\nIssuers of convertible\nsecurities are often\nnot as strong\nfinancially as issuers\nwith higher credit\nratings. Convertible\nsecurities typically\nprovide yields lower\nthan comparable non-\nconvertible\nsecurities. Their\nvalues may be more\nvolatile than those of\nnon-convertible\nsecurities, reflecting\nchanges in the values\nof the securities into\nwhich they are\nconvertible.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nCurrency Risk: The\nvalue of the Fund's\nassets may be affected\nfavorably or\nunfavorably by\ncurrency exchange\nrates, currency\nexchange control\nregulations, and\ndelays, restrictions\nor prohibitions on the\nrepatriation of\nforeign currencies.\nForeign currency\nexchange rates may\nhave significant\nvolatility, and\nchanges in the values\nof foreign currencies\nagainst the U.S.\ndollar may result in\nsubstantial declines\nin the values of the\nFund's assets\ndenominated in foreign\ncurrencies.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. 3\n\nTable of Contents\nEmerging Markets Risk:\nRisks of investing in\nemerging markets\ninclude, among others,\ngreater political and\neconomic instability,\ngreater volatility in\ncurrency exchange\nrates, less developed\nsecurities markets,\npossible trade\nbarriers, currency\ntransfer restrictions,\na more limited number\nof potential buyers\nand issuers, an\nemerging market\ncountry's dependence\non revenue from\nparticular commodities\nor international aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nExchange Traded Funds\nRisk: The Fund is\nsubject to\nsubstantially the same\nrisks as those\nassociated with the\ndirect ownership of\nthe securities\nrepresented by an\nunderlying ETF in\nwhich it invests.\nAlso, the Fund bears\nits proportionate\nshare of the fees and\nexpenses of an\nunderlying ETF in\nwhich it invests. In\naddition, the shares\nof an underlying ETF\nmay trade at a premium\nor discount to their\nintrinsic value ( i.e.\n, the market value may\ndiffer from the net\nasset value of an\nETF's shares) for a\nnumber of reasons. For\nexample, supply and\ndemand for shares of\nan underlying ETF or\nmarket disruptions may\ncause the market price\nof the underlying ETF\nto deviate from the\nvalue of the\nunderlying ETF's\ninvestments, which may\nbe exacerbated in less\nliquid markets.\nGeographic Focus Risk:\nThe performance of a\nfund that is less\ndiversified across\ncountries or\ngeographic regions\nwill be closely tied\nto market, currency,\neconomic, political,\nenvironmental, or\nregulatory conditions\nand developments in\nthe countries or\nregions in which the\nfund invests, and may\nbe more volatile than\nthe performance of a\nmore geographically-\ndiversified fund.\nIncome Risk: The\nFund's income may\ndecline due to falling\ninterest rates or\nother factors. Issuers\nof securities held by\nthe Fund may call or\nredeem the securities\nduring periods of\nfalling interest\nrates, and the Fund\nwould likely be\nrequired to reinvest\nin securities paying\nlower interest rates.\nIf an obligation held\nby the Fund is\nprepaid, the Fund may\nhave to reinvest the\nprepayment in other\nobligations paying\nincome at lower rates.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions .\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to trackthe\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Inflation-\nIndexed Securities\nRisk: The principal\namount of an\ninflation-indexed\nsecurity typically\nincreases with\ninflation and\ndecreases with\ndeflation, as measured\nby a specified index.\nIt is possible that,\nin a period of\ndeclining inflation\nrates, the Fund could\nreceive at maturity\nless than the initial\nprincipal amount of an\ninflation-indexed\nsecurity. Changes in\nthe values of\ninflation-indexed\nsecurities may be\ndifficult to predict,\nand it is possible\nthat an investment in\nsuch securities will\nhave an effect\ndifferent from that\nanticipated. Liquidity\nRisk: Lack of a ready\nmarket or restrictions\non resale may limit\nthe ability of the\nFund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid securities\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations 4\nTable of Contents on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid securities\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or\nsector.Momentum Risk:\nThe Fund employs a\n\u201cmomentum\u201d style of\ninvesting that\nemphasizes investing\nin securities that\nhave had higher recent\nprice performance\ncompared to other\nsecurities. This style\nof investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat these securities\nmay be more volatile\nthan a broad cross-\nsection of securities\nor that the returns on\nsecurities that have\npreviously exhibited\nprice momentum are\nless than returns on\nother styles of\ninvesting or the\noverall stock market.\nMomentum can turn\nquickly and cause\nsignificant variation\nfrom other types of\ninvestments. Mortgage-\nRelated and Other\nAsset-Backed\nSecurities Risk:\nInvestments in\nmortgage-related and\nother asset-backed\nsecurities are subject\nto the risk of\nsignificant credit\ndowngrades,\nilliquidity, and\ndefaults to a greater\nextent than many other\ntypes of fixed-income\ninvestments. The\nliquidity of mortgage-\nrelated and asset-\nbacked securities may\nchange over time.\nDuring periods of\nfalling interest\nrates, mortgage- and\nasset-backed\nsecurities may be\ncalled or prepaid,\nwhich may result in\nthe Fund having to\nreinvest proceeds in\nother investments at a\nlower interest rate.\nDuring periods of\nrising interest rates,\nthe average life of\nmortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities may\nextend, which may lock\nin a below-market\ninterest rate,\nincrease the\nsecurity's duration\nand interest rate\nsensitivity, and\nreduce the value of\nthe security.\nEnforcing rights\nagainst the underlying\nassets or collateral\nmay be difficult, and\nthe underlying assets\nor collateral may be\ninsufficient if the\nissuer defaults.\nMunicipal Obligations\nRisk: Issuers,\nincluding governmental\nissuers, may be unable\nto pay their\nobligations as they\ncome due. The values\nof municipal\nobligations may be\nadversely affected by\nlocal political and\neconomic conditions\nand developments. In\naddition, the values\nof municipal\nobligations that\ndepend on a specific\nrevenue source to fund\ntheir payment\nobligations may\nfluctuate as a result\nof actual or\nanticipated changes in\nthe cash flows\ngenerated by the\nrevenue source or\nchanges in the\npriority of the\nmunicipal obligation\nto receive the cash\nflows generated by the\nrevenue source.\nMunicipal obligations\nmay be more\nsusceptible to\ndowngrades or defaults\nduring recessions or\nsimilar periods of\neconomic stress. In\naddition, changes in\nfederal tax laws or\nthe activity of an\nissuer may adversely\naffect the tax-exempt\nstatus of municipal\nobligations. Loss of\ntax-exempt status may\ncause interest\nreceived and\ndistributed by the\nFund to shareholders\nto be taxable and may\nresult in a\nsignificant decline in\nthe values of such\nmunicipal obligations.\nNon-Diversification\nRisk: To the extent\nthe Fund is or becomes\n\u201cnon-diversified,\u201d the\nFund may hold a\nsmaller number of\nportfolio securities\nthan many other funds.\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of changes\nin the composition of\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nNon-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nCertain countries have\nrecently experienced\n(or currently are\nexpected to\nexperience) negative\ninterest rates on\ncertain fixed-income\nsecurities, and\nsimilar interest rate\nconditions may be\nexperienced in other\nregions. Investments\nin fixed-income\nsecurities with very\nlow or negative\ninterest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's\nsusceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and\nperformance, and such\ninvestments may be\nsubject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced\nliquidity. 5 Table of\nContents Portfolio\nTurnover Risk:\nFrequent purchases and\nsales of portfolio\nsecurities may result\nin higher Fund\nexpenses and may\nresult in more\nsignificant\ndistributions of\nshort-term capital\ngains to investors,\nwhich are taxed to\nindividuals as\nordinary income. The\nFund may engage in\nfrequent trading of\nits portfolio\nsecurities in\nconnection with Index\nrebalancing. Frequent\ntrading may cause the\nFund to incur\nadditional transaction\ncosts and experience\ndifferent tax\nconsequences in\ncomparison to an ETF\nthat does not engage\nin frequent\ntrading.Preferred\nSecurities Risk:\nGenerally, preferred\nsecurity holders have\nno or limited voting\nrights with respect to\nthe issuing company.\nIn addition, preferred\nsecurities are\nsubordinated to bonds\nand other debt\ninstruments in a\ncompany's capital\nstructure and\ntherefore will be\nsubject to greater\ncredit risk than those\ndebt instruments.\nDividend payments on a\npreferred security\ntypically must be\ndeclared by the\nissuer's board of\ndirectors. In the\nevent an issuer of\npreferred securities\nexperiences economic\ndifficulties, the\nissuer's preferred\nsecurities may lose\nsubstantial value due\nto the reduced\nlikelihood that the\nissuer's board of\ndirectors will declare\na dividend and the\nfact that the\npreferred security may\nbe subordinated to\nother securities of\nthe same issuer.\nFurther, because many\npreferred securities\npay dividends at a\nfixed rate, their\nmarket price can be\nsensitive to changes\nin interest rates in a\nmanner similar to\nbonds \u2014 that is, as\ninterest rates rise,\nthe value of the\npreferred securities\nheld by the Fund are\nlikely to decline. In\naddition, because many\npreferred securities\nallow holders to\nconvert the preferred\nsecurities into common\nstock of the issuer,\ntheir market price can\nbe sensitive to\nchanges in the value\nof the issuer's common\nstock and, therefore,\ndeclining common stock\nvalues may also cause\nthe value of the\nFund's investments to\ndecline. Preferred\nsecurities often have\ncall features which\nallow the issuer to\nredeem the security at\nits discretion. The\nredemption of a\npreferred security\nhaving a higher than\naverage yield may\ncause a decrease in\nthe Fund's yield.\nRestricted Securities\nRisk: The Fund may\nhold securities that\nhave not been\nregistered for sale to\nthe public under the\nU.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat a trading market\nwill exist at any time\nfor any particular\nrestricted security.\nLimitations on the\nresale of these\nsecurities may have an\nadverse effect on\ntheir marketability,\nand may prevent the\nFund from disposing of\nthem promptly at\nreasonable prices. The\nFund may have to bear\nthe expense of\nregistering the\nsecurities for resale\nand the risk of\nsubstantial delays in\neffecting the\nregistration. Also,\nrestricted securities\nmay be difficult to\nvalue because market\nquotations may not be\nreadily available, and\nthe securities may\nhave significant\nvolatility. Senior\nLoan Risk: Investments\nin first lien senior\nsecured floating rate\nbank loans (\u201cSenior\nLoans\u201d) are subject to\ncredit risk and\ngeneral investment\nrisk. Credit risk\nrefers to the\npossibility that the\nborrower of a Senior\nLoan will be unable\nand/or unwilling to\nmake timely interest\npayments and/or repay\nthe principal on its\nobligation. Default in\nthe payment of\ninterest or principal\non a Senior Loan will\nresult in a reduction\nin the value of the\nSenior Loan and\nconsequently a\nreduction in the value\nof the Fund's\ninvestments and a\npotential decrease in\nthe net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d) of the Fund.\nSenior Loans are also\nsubject to the risk\nthat the value of the\ncollateral securing a\nSenior Loan may\ndecline, be\ninsufficient to meet\nthe obligations of the\nborrower or be\ndifficult to\nliquidate. In\naddition, the Fund's\naccess to the\ncollateral may be\nlimited by bankruptcy\nor other insolvency\nlaws. Further, loans\nheld by the Fund may\nnot be considered\nsecurities and,\ntherefore, purchasers,\nsuch as the Fund, may\nnot be entitled to\nrely on the strong\nanti-fraud protections\nof the federal\nsecurities laws. Some\nSenior Loans are\nsubject to the risk\nthat a court, pursuant\nto fraudulent\nconveyance or other\nsimilar laws, could\nsubordinate the Senior\nLoans to presently\nexisting or future\nindebtedness of the\nborrower or take other\naction detrimental to\nlenders, including the\nFund, such as\ninvalidation of Senior\nLoans or causing\ninterest previously\npaid to be refunded to\nthe borrower. Senior\nLoans are also subject\nto high yield\nsecurities risks and\nliquidity risks\ndescribed above. In\naddition, bank loans\nmay be subject to\nextended settlement\nperiods, which may\nimpair the Fund's\nability to sell or\nrealize the full value\nof its loans in the\nevent of a need to\nliquidate such loans\nin a compressed period\nof time. Some of the\nloans in which the\nFund may invest or\nobtain exposure to may\nbe \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d\nloans. Covenant-lite\nloans may contain\nfewer or no\nmaintenance covenants\ncompared to other\nloans and may not\ninclude terms which\nallow the lender to\nmonitor the\nperformance of the\nborrower and declare a\ndefault if certain\ncriteria are breached.\nThe Fund may\nexperience delays in\nenforcing its rights\non its holdings of\ncovenant-lite loans.\nSovereign Debt\nObligations Risk:\nInvestments in debt\nsecurities issued by\ngovernments or by\ngovernment agencies\nand instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that\nthe governmental\nentities responsible\nfor repayment may be\nunable or unwilling to\npay interest and repay\nprincipal when due.\nMany sovereign debt\nobligations may be\nrated below\ninvestment-grade\n(\u201cjunk\u201d bonds). Any\nrestructuring of a\nsovereign debt\nobligation held by the\nFund will likely have\na significant adverse\neffect on the value of\nthe obligation. In the\nevent of default of\nsovereign debt, the\nFund may be unable to\npursue legal action\nagainst the sovereign\nissuer or to realize\non collateral securing\nthe debt. 6 Table of\nContents\n\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. U.S.\nGovernment Securities\nRisk: Certain U.S.\ngovernment securities\nare supported by the\nfull faith and credit\nof the United States;\nothers are supported\nby the right of the\nissuer to borrow from\nthe U.S. Treasury;\nothers are supported\nby the discretionary\nauthority of the U.S.\ngovernment to purchase\nthe agency's\nobligations; and still\nothers are supported\nonly by the credit of\nthe issuing agency,\ninstrumentality, or\nenterprise. Although\nU.S. government-\nsponsored enterprises\nsuch as the Federal\nHome Loan Mortgage\nCorporation (\u201cFreddie\nMac\u201d) and the Federal\nNational Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie\nMae\u201d) may be chartered\nor sponsored by\nCongress, they are not\nfunded by\nCongressional\nappropriations, and\ntheir securities are\nnot issued by the U.S.\nTreasury, are not\nsupported by the full\nfaith and credit of\nthe U.S. government,\nand involve increased\ncredit risks. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations\nRisk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ\nfrom other fixed\nincome securities in\ntheir interest rates,\nmaturities, times of\nissuance and other\ncharacteristics.\nSimilar to other\nissuers, changes to\nthe financial\ncondition or credit\nrating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause\nthe value of the\nFund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to\ndecline. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially\na large portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. Variable and\nFloating Rate\nSecurities Risk:\nDuring periods of\nincreasing interest\nrates, changes in the\ncoupon rates of\nvariable or floating\nrate securities may\nlag behind the changes\nin market rates or may\nhave limits on the\nmaximum increases in\ncoupon rates.\nAlternatively, during\nperiods of declining\ninterest rates, the\ncoupon rates on such\nsecurities will\ntypically readjust\ndownward resulting in\na lower yield. In\naddition, investment\nin derivative variable\nrate securities, such\nas inverse floaters,\nwhose rates vary\ninversely with market\nrates of interest, or\nrange floaters or\ncapped floaters, whose\nrates are subject to\nperiodic or lifetime\ncaps, or in securities\nthat pay a rate of\ninterest determined by\napplying a multiple to\nthe variable rate\ninvolves special risks\nas compared to\ninvestment in a fixed-\nrate security and may\ninvolve leverage.\nFloating rate notes\nare generally subject\nto legal or\ncontractual\nrestrictions on\nresale, may trade\ninfrequently, and\ntheir value may be\nimpaired when the Fund\nneeds to liquidate\nsuch securities.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Raymond Donofrio. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Raymond\nDonofrio is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Global\nEquity Beta Solutions Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2008. Purchase and Sale Information\nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NASDAQ\nStock Market LLC (the \u201cExchange\u201d), other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntreated as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome, tax-exempt interest, and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you.\nDistributions attributable to tax-exempt\ninterest received by a SPDR ETF in which the\nFund invests may be exempt from regular U.S.\nfederal income tax. Certain dividends may be\nexempt from regular federal income tax, but\nmay be subject to the federal alternative\nminimum tax. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase\nFund Shares through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), the\nAdviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, including educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAdditional Strategies Information Principal\nStrategies General. Please see \u201cThe Fund's\nPrincipal Investment Strategy\u201d section under\n\u201cFund Summary\u201d above for a complete discussion\nof the Fund's principal investment strategies.\nThe Fund may invest in various types of\nsecurities and engage in various investment\ntechniques which are not the principal focus\nof the Fund and therefore are not described in\nthis Prospectus. These securities, techniques\nand practices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain\nfree of charge by contacting shareholder\nservices (see the back cover of this\nProspectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of\nthe Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e.,\nobtain a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex). A number of factors may affect the\nFund's ability to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index, and there can be\nno guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high\ndegree of correlation. For example, the Fund\nmay not be able to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index when there are\npractical difficulties or substantial costs\ninvolved in compiling a portfolio of\nsecurities to follow the Index, when a\nsecurity in the Index becomes temporarily\nilliquid, unavailable or less liquid, or legal\nrestrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from\ninvesting in a security in the Index. From\ntime to time, securities are added to or\nremoved from the Index. The Adviser may sell\nsecurities that are represented in the Index,\nor purchase securities that are not yet\nrepresented in the Index, in anticipation of\ntheir removal from or addition to the Index.\nThe Fund, as described in the SAI, has adopted\na non-fundamental investment policy to invest\ndirectly, or indirectly through the underlying\nETFs, at least 80% of its respective net\nassets, plus the amount of borrowings for\ninvestment purposes, in investments suggested\nby its name, measured at the time of\ninvestment. The Fund will provide shareholders\nwith at least 60 days' notice prior to any\nchange in this non-fundamental 80% investment\npolicy. The Board of Trustees of the Trust\n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change the Fund's investment\nstrategy, Index and other policies without\nshareholder approval, except as otherwise\nindicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI.\nThe Board may also change the Fund's\ninvestment objective without shareholder\napproval. Non-Principal Strategies Certain\nOther Investments . The Fund may invest in\nstructured notes (notes on which the amount of\nprincipal repayment and interest payments are\nbased on the movement of one or more specified\nfactors such as the movement of a particular\nsecurity or index), swaps, options and futures\ncontracts. Swaps, options and futures\ncontracts and structured notes may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that\ncorresponds to its Index and in managing cash\nflows. Temporary Defensive Positions . In\ncertain situations or market conditions, the\nFund may temporarily depart from its normal\ninvestment policies and strategies, provided\nthat the alternative is consistent with the\nFund's investment objective and is in the best\ninterest of the Fund. For example, the Fund\nmay make larger than normal investments in\nderivatives to maintain exposure to its Index\nif it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . The Fund\nmay borrow money from a bank as permitted by\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or\nother regulatory agency with authority over\nthe Fund, but only for temporary or emergency\npurposes. The Fund may also invest in reverse\nrepurchase agreements, which are considered\nborrowings under the 1940 Act. Although the\n1940 Act presently allows the Fund to borrow\nfrom any bank (including pledging, mortgaging\nor hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33\n1/ 3% of its total assets (not including\ntemporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of\nits total assets), and there is no percentage\nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nunder normal circumstances any borrowings by\nthe Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's\ntotal assets.\nLending of Securities . The Fund may lend its \nportfolio securities in an amount not to      \nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets via \na securities lending program through its      \nsecurities lending agent, State Street Bank   \nand Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d or the      \n\u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers, dealers and     \nother financial institutions desiring to      \nborrow securities to complete transactions and\nfor other purposes. A securities lending      \nprogram allows the Fund to receive a portion  \nof the income generated by lending its        \nsecurities and investing the respective       \ncollateral. The Fund will receive collateral 9\nTable of Contents for each loaned security    \nwhich is at least equal to the market value of\nthat security, marked to market each trading  \nday. In the securities lending program, the   \nborrower generally has the right to vote the  \nloaned securities; however, the Fund may call \nloans to vote proxies if a material issue     \naffecting the Fund's economic interest in the \ninvestment is to be voted upon. Security loans\nmay be terminated at any time by the Fund.    \nAdditional Risk Information The following     \nsection provides information regarding the    \nprincipal risks identified under \u201cPrincipal   \nRisks of Investing in the Fund\u201d in the Fund   \nSummary along with additional risk            \ninformation.

Contents Affiliated ETF Risk . To the\nextent the Fund invests in an affiliated ETF,\nthe Fund's investment performance and risks\nmay be directly related to the investment\nperformance and risks of the Affiliated ETF.\nIn addition, the Adviser may have an incentive\nto take into account the effect on an\naffiliated ETF in which the Fund may invest in\ndetermining whether, and under what\ncircumstances, to purchase or sell shares in\nthat affiliated ETF. Although the Adviser\ntakes steps to address the conflicts of\ninterest, it is possible that the conflicts\ncould impact the Fund. Below Investment-Grade\nSecurities Risk . Securities rated below\ninvestment-grade and unrated securities of\ncomparable credit quality (commonly known as\n\u201chigh-yield bonds\u201d or \u201cjunk bonds\u201d) lack\nstrong investment-grade characteristics, are\nconsidered predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the issuer's continuing ability to\nmake principal and interest payments, and are\nsubject to greater levels of credit, liquidity\nand market risk than higher-rated securities.\nThey can involve a substantially greater risk\nof default than higher-rated securities, and\ntheir values can decline significantly over\nshort periods of time. Issuers of lower-\nquality debt securities may have substantially\ngreater risk of insolvency or bankruptcy than\nissuers of higher-quality debt securities. In\nthe event the issuer of a debt security held\nby the Fund defaults on its payments or\nbecomes insolvent or bankrupt, the Fund may\nnot receive the return it was promised on the\ninvestment and could lose its entire\ninvestment. The lower ratings of junk bonds\nreflect a greater possibility that actual or\nperceived adverse changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuer or in general economic\nconditions, or an unanticipated rise in\ninterest rates, may impair the ability of the\nissuer to make payments of interest and\nprincipal. If this were to occur, the values\nof such securities held by the Fund may fall\nsubstantially and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the value of its investment. Lower-\nquality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or\nthe market or economy in general, than higher\nquality debt securities. The market for lower\nquality debt securities can be less liquid\nthan for higher quality debt securities,\nespecially during periods of recession or\ngeneral market decline, which could make it\ndifficult at times for the Fund to sell\ncertain securities at prices used in\ncalculating the Fund's net asset value. These\nsecurities may have significant volatility.\nCall/Prepayment Risk . Call/prepayment risk is\nthe risk that an issuer will exercise its\nright to pay principal on an obligation held\nby the Fund earlier than expected or required.\nThis may occur, for example, when there is a\ndecline in interest rates, and an issuer of\nbonds or preferred stock redeems the bonds or\nstock in order to replace them with\nobligations on which it is required to pay a\nlower interest or dividend rate. It may also\noccur when there is an unanticipated increase\nin the rate at which mortgages or other\nreceivables underlying mortgage- or asset-\nbacked securities held by the Fund are\nprepaid. In any such case, the Fund may be\nforced to invest the prepaid amounts in lower-\nyielding investments, resulting in a decline\nin the Fund's income. Communication Services\nSector Risk. Communication services companies\nare particularly vulnerable to the potential\nobsolescence of products and services due to\ntechnological advancement and the innovation\nof competitors. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may also be affected by other\ncompetitive pressures, such as pricing\ncompetition, as well as research and\ndevelopment costs, substantial capital\nrequirements and government regulation.\nAdditionally, fluctuating domestic and\ninternational demand, shifting demographics\nand often unpredictable changes in consumer\ntastes can drastically affect a communication\nservices company's profitability. While all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\nConsumer Cyclical Sector Risk . Companies in\nthe consumer cyclical sector are largely\nimpacted by the performance of the overall\nglobal economy, changes in interest rates,\nfluctuations in supply and demand, and changes\nin consumer preferences. Success depends\nheavily on disposable household income and\nconsumer spending. As a result, consumer\ncyclical companies may be adversely affected\nand lose value quickly in periods of economic\ndownturns. Also, companies in the consumer\ncyclical sector may be subject to severe\ncompetition, which may have an adverse impact\non their respective profitability. Consumer\nNon-Cyclical Sector Risk . Investments in the\nconsumer non-cyclical sector involve risks\nassociated with companies that manufacture\nproducts and provide discretionary services\ndirectly to the consumer. Performance of\ncompanies in the consumer non-cyclical sector\nmay be adversely impacted by fluctuations in\nsupply and demand, changes in the global\neconomy, consumer spending, competition,\ndemographics and consumer preferences, and\nproduction spending. Companies in the consumer\nnon-cyclical sector are also affected by\nglobal economic, environmental and political\nevents, and economic conditions. The products\nof consumer non-cyclical companies are subject\nto government regulation which may negatively\nimpact such companies' performance. 20 Table\nof Contents Convertible Securities Risk .\nConvertible securities are bonds, debentures,\nnotes, preferred stocks or other securities\nthat may be converted or exchanged (by the\nholder or by the issuer, depending on the\nterms of the securities) into shares of the\nunderlying common stock (or cash or securities\nof equivalent value) at a stated exchange\nratio. Convertible securities may be\nsubordinate to other debt securities issued by\nthe same issuer. Issuers of convertible\nsecurities are often not as strong financially\nas issuers with higher credit ratings.\nConvertible securities typically provide\nyields lower than comparable non-convertible\nsecurities. Their values may be more volatile\nthan those of non-convertible securities,\nreflecting changes in the values of the\nsecurities into which they are convertible.\nCounterparty Risk . The Fund will be subject\nto credit risk with respect to the\ncounterparties with which the Fund enters into\nderivatives contracts and other transactions\nsuch as repurchase agreements or reverse\nrepurchase agreements. The Fund's ability to\nprofit from these types of investments and\ntransactions will depend on the willingness\nand ability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations. If a counterparty fails to meet\nits contractual obligations, the Fund may be\nunable to terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. The Fund may experience\nsignificant delays in obtaining any recovery\nin an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any\ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in\nsuch circumstances. If the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by its counterparty, it may\nbe delayed or prevented from realizing on the\ncollateral in the event of a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if the Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another institution being\nsubstituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, the\nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the\nfinancial institution's authority, the\nfinancial institution's liabilities could be\nwritten down, eliminated or converted into\nequity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial\ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of its securities and, if the\nFund holds such securities or has entered into\na transaction with such a financial security\nwhen a bail-in occurs, the Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Credit Risk . Credit risk\nis the risk that an issuer, guarantor or\nliquidity provider of a fixed-income security\nheld by the Fund may be unable or unwilling,\nor may be perceived (whether by market\nparticipants, ratings agencies, pricing\nservices or otherwise) as unable or unwilling,\nto make timely principal and/or interest\npayments, or to otherwise honor its\nobligations. It includes the risk that the\nsecurity will be downgraded by a credit rating\nagency; generally, lower credit quality\nissuers present higher credit risks. An actual\nor perceived decline in creditworthiness of an\nissuer of a fixed-income security held by the\nFund may result in a decrease in the value of\nthe security. It is possible that the ability\nof an issuer to meet its obligations will\ndecline substantially during the period when\nthe Fund owns securities of the issuer or that\nthe issuer will default on its obligations or\nthat the obligations of the issuer will be\nlimited or restructured. The credit rating\nassigned to any particular investment does not\nnecessarily reflect the issuer's current\nfinancial condition and does not reflect an\nassessment of an investment's volatility or\nliquidity. Securities rated in the lowest\ncategory of investment-grade are considered to\nhave speculative characteristics. If a\nsecurity held by the Fund loses its rating or\nits rating is downgraded, the Fund may\nnonetheless continue to hold the security in\nthe discretion of the Adviser. In the case of\nasset-backed or mortgage-related securities,\nchanges in the actual or perceived ability of\nthe obligors on the underlying assets or\nmortgages to make payments of interest and/or\nprincipal may affect the values of those\nsecurities. Currency Risk. Investments in\nissuers in different countries are often\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar. Changes in the values of those\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar may\nhave a positive or negative effect on the\nvalues of the Fund's investments denominated\nin those currencies. The values of other\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar may\nfluctuate in response to, among other factors,\ninterest rate changes, intervention (or\nfailure to intervene) by national governments,\ncentral banks, or supranational entities such\nas the International Monetary Fund, the\nimposition of currency controls, and other\npolitical or regulatory developments. Currency\nvalues can decrease significantly both in the\nshort term and over the long term in response\nto these and other developments. Continuing\nuncertainty as to the status of the Euro and\nthe Economic and Monetary Union of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201cEMU\u201d) 21 Table of\nContents has created significant volatility in\ncurrency and financial markets generally. Any\npartial or complete dissolution of the EMU, or\nany continued uncertainty as to its status,\ncould have significant adverse effects on\ncurrency and financial markets, and on the\nvalues of the Fund's portfolio investments.\nDebt Securities Risk . The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations,\nchanges in interest rates, actual or perceived\ninability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make\nscheduled principal or interest payments or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets; the\nrisk of low rates of return due to\nreinvestment of securities during periods of\nfalling interest rates or repayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or interest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income due to falling interest\nrates. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally\nanticipated and the value of those securities\nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, a decline\nin the Fund's income and yield, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and increased volatility of\nthe fixed income markets. The current\nhistorically low interest rate environment\nheightens the risks associated with rising\ninterest rates. During periods when interest\nrates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can\nbe low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). If the principal on a debt obligation\nis prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in\nobligations paying interest at lower rates.\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, the\nincome received by the Fund may decline.\nChanges in interest rates will likely have a\ngreater effect on the values of debt\nsecurities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the\nreturns on other investment options, including\ninvestments in equity securities. Depositary\nReceipts Risk . American Depositary Receipts\n(\u201cADRs\u201d) are typically trust receipts issued\nby a U.S. bank or trust company that evidence\nan indirect interest in underlying securities\nissued by a foreign entity. Global Depositary\nReceipts (\u201cGDRs\u201d), European Depositary\nReceipts (\u201cEDRs\u201d), and other types of\ndepositary receipts are typically issued by\nnon-U.S. banks or financial institutions to\nevidence an interest in underlying securities\nissued by either a U.S. or a non-U.S. entity.\nInvestments in non-U.S. issuers through ADRs,\nGDRs, EDRs, and other types of depositary\nreceipts generally involve risks applicable to\nother types of investments in non-U.S.\nissuers. Investments in depositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and more volatile than the\nunderlying securities in their primary trading\nmarket. If a depositary receipt is denominated\nin a different currency than its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund will be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both the investment in the\ndepositary receipt and the underlying\nsecurity. There may be less publicly available\ninformation regarding the issuer of the\nsecurities underlying a depositary receipt\nthan if those securities were traded directly\nin U.S. securities markets. Depositary\nreceipts may or may not be sponsored by the\nissuers of the underlying securities, and\ninformation regarding issuers of securities\nunderlying unsponsored depositary receipts may\nbe more limited than for sponsored depositary\nreceipts. The values of depositary receipts\nmay decline for a number of reasons relating\nto the issuers or sponsors of the depositary\nreceipts, including, but not limited to,\ninsolvency of the issuer or sponsor. Holders\nof depositary receipts may have limited or no\nrights to take action with respect to the\nunderlying securities or to compel the issuer\nof the receipts to take action. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may differ from the prices\nof securities upon which they are based. To\nthe extent the Fund invests in depositary\nreceipts based on securities included in the\nIndex, such differences in prices may increase\nindex tracking risk. Derivatives Risk. A\nderivative is a financial contract the value\nof which depends on, or is derived from, the\nvalue of an underlying asset, interest rate,\nor index. Derivative transactions typically\ninvolve leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a derivative\ntransaction will result in a loss greater than\nthe principal amount invested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price.\nRisks associated with derivative instruments\ninclude potential changes in value in response\nto interest rate changes or other market\ndevelopments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential\nfor the derivative transaction not to have the\neffect the Adviser anticipated or a different\nor less favorable effect than the Adviser\nanticipated; the failure of the counterparty\nto the derivative transaction to perform its\nobligations under the transaction or to settle\na trade; possible mispricing or improper\nvaluation of the derivative instrument;\nimperfect correlation in the value of a\nderivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that the\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that the Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative 22 Table of Contents\ninstrument, including without limitation\nabsence of a secondary trading market; the\npotential for reduced returns to the Fund due\nto losses on the transaction and an increase\nin volatility; the potential for the\nderivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction.\nForward Currency Contracts Risk . In a forward\ncurrency contract, the Fund agrees to buy in\nthe future an amount in one currency in return\nfor another currency, at an exchange rate\ndetermined at the time the contract is entered\ninto. If currency exchange rates move against\nthe Fund's position during the term of the\ncontract, the Fund will lose money on the\ncontract. There is no limit on the extent to\nwhich exchange rates may move against the\nFund's position. The markets for certain\ncurrencies may at times become illiquid, and\nthe Fund may be unable to enter into new\nforward contracts or to close out existing\ncontracts. Forward currency contracts are\nentered into in the over-the-counter market,\nand the Fund's ability to profit from a\ncontract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations under the contract. Use by the\nFund of foreign currency forward contracts may\ngive rise to investment leverage. Futures\nContract Risk; Other Exchange-Traded\nDerivatives Risk . The risk of loss relating\nto the use of futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives is potentially\nunlimited. The ability to establish and close\nout positions in futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives will be subject to\nthe development and maintenance of a liquid\nsecondary market. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract or\nother exchange-traded derivative or at any\nparticular time. In the event no such market\nexists for a particular derivative, it might\nnot be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate the derivative. In using futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives, the Fund will be reliant on the\nability of the Adviser to predict market and\nprice movements correctly; the skills needed\nto use such derivatives successfully are\ndifferent from those needed for traditional\nportfolio management. If the Fund uses futures\ncontracts or other exchange-traded derivatives\nfor hedging purposes, there is a risk of\nimperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the derivatives and movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying the derivatives\nor movements in the prices of the Fund's\ninvestments that are the subject of such\nhedge. The prices of futures and other\nexchange-traded derivatives, for a number of\nreasons, may not correlate perfectly with\nmovements in the securities or index\nunderlying them. For example, participants in\nthe futures markets and in markets for other\nexchange-traded derivatives are subject to\nmargin deposit requirements. Such requirements\nmay cause investors to take actions with\nrespect to their derivatives positions that\nthey would not otherwise take. The margin\nrequirements in the derivatives markets may be\nless onerous than margin requirements in the\nsecurities markets in general, and as a result\nthose markets may attract more speculators\nthan the securities markets do. Increased\nparticipation by speculators in those markets\nmay cause temporary price distortions. Due to\nthe possibility of price distortion, even a\ncorrect forecast of general market trends by\nthe Adviser still may not result in a\nsuccessful derivatives activity over a very\nshort time period. The risk of a position in a\nfutures contract or other exchange-traded\nderivative may be very large compared to the\nrelatively low level of margin the Fund is\nrequired to deposit. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its exchange-traded\nderivatives transactions. The Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with\nits transactions in futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives. In the\nevent of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, the\nFund may not be able to recover all (or any)\nof the margin it has posted with the futures\ncommission merchant, or to realize the value\nof any increase in the price of its positions,\nor it may experience a significant delay in\ndoing so. The Fund also may be delayed or\nprevented from recovering margin or other\namounts deposited with a futures commission\nmerchant or futures clearinghouse. The\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the\n\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have\nestablished limits referred to as \u201cspeculative\nposition limits\u201d on the maximum net long or\nnet short positions that any person and\ncertain affiliated entities may hold or\ncontrol in a particular futures contract.\nTrading limits are imposed on the number of\ncontracts that any person may trade on a\nparticular trading day. An exchange may order\nthe liquidation of positions found to be in\nviolation of these limits and it may impose\nsanctions or restrictions. In addition, the\nDodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to establish\nspeculative position limits on certain\ncommodity futures contracts and their\neconomically equivalent futures, options and\nswaps. Regulatory action taken by the CFTC to\nestablish these additional position limits may\nadversely affect the market liquidity of the\nfutures, options and economically equivalent\nderivatives in which the Fund may invest. It\nis possible that, as a result of such limits,\nthe Fund's Adviser will be precluded from 23\nTable of Contents taking positions in certain\nfutures contracts or over-the-counter\nderivatives as a result of positions held by\nother clients of the Adviser or by the Adviser\nor its affiliates themselves. Futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives traded on markets outside the U.S.\nare not generally subject to the same level of\nregulation by the CFTC or other U.S.\nregulatory entities as contracts traded in the\nU.S., including without limitation as to the\nexecution, delivery, and clearing of\ntransactions. U.S. regulators neither regulate\nthe activities of a foreign exchange, nor have\nthe power to compel enforcement of the rules\nof the foreign exchange or the laws of the\nforeign country in question. Margin and other\npayments made by the Fund may not be afforded\nthe same protections as are afforded those\npayments in the U.S., including in connection\nwith the insolvency of an executing or\nclearing broker or a clearinghouse or\nexchange. Certain foreign futures contracts\nand other exchange-traded derivatives may be\nless liquid and more volatile than U.S.\ncontracts. Swaps Risk. A swap is a two-party\ncontract that generally obligates one party to\npay the positive return and the other party to\npay the negative return on a specified\nreference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment\nin securities, because swaps may be leveraged\nand are subject to counterparty risk (e.g. ,\nthe risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and\npricing risk (i.e. , swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). Swaps may also be considered illiquid.\nIt may not be possible for the Fund to\nliquidate a swap position at an advantageous\ntime or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Emerging Markets Risk . Investments in\nemerging markets are generally subject to a\ngreater risk of loss than investments in\ndeveloped markets. This may be due to, among\nother things, the possibility of greater\nmarket volatility, lower trading volume and\nliquidity, greater risk of expropriation,\nnationalization, and social, political and\neconomic instability, greater reliance on a\nfew industries, international trade or revenue\nfrom particular commodities, less developed\naccounting, legal and regulatory systems,\nhigher levels of inflation, deflation or\ncurrency devaluation, greater risk of market\nshut down, and more significant governmental\nlimitations on investment policy as compared\nto those typically found in a developed\nmarket. In addition, issuers (including\ngovernments) in emerging market countries may\nhave less financial stability than in other\ncountries. The securities of emerging market\ncompanies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than more widely held\nsecurities. Market disruptions or substantial\nmarket corrections may limit very\nsignificantly the liquidity of securities of\ncertain companies in a particular country or\ngeographic region, or of all companies in the\ncountry or region. The Fund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions in such securities at\nany time, or at a favorable price, in order to\nmeet the Fund's obligations. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as\nembargo and acts of war. As a result, there\nwill tend to be an increased risk of price\nvolatility in investments in emerging market\ncountries, which may be magnified by currency\nfluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar.\nSettlement and asset custody practices for\ntransactions in emerging markets may differ\nfrom those in developed markets. Such\ndifferences may include possible delays in\nsettlement and certain settlement practices,\nsuch as delivery of securities prior to\nreceipt of payment, which increase the\nlikelihood of a \u201cfailed settlement.\u201d Failed\nsettlements can result in losses. For these\nand other reasons, investments in emerging\nmarkets are often considered speculative.\nEquity Investing Risk . The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up\nor down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.\nThe value of a security may decline for a\nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer, such as management performance,\nfinancial leverage, non-compliance with\nregulatory requirements, and reduced demand\nfor the issuer's goods or services. The values\nof equity securities also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are\nnot specifically related to a particular\ncompany, such as real or perceived adverse\neconomic conditions, changes in the general\noutlook for corporate earnings, changes in\ninterest or currency rates, or adverse\ninvestor sentiment generally. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which\nmay cause stock prices to fall over short or\nextended periods of time. Exchange Traded\nFunds Risk. The Fund is subject to\nsubstantially the same risks as those\nassociated with the direct ownership of the\nsecurities or other assets represented by an\nunderlying ETF in which it invests. Also, the\nFund bears its proportionate share of the fees\nand expenses of an underlying ETF in which it\ninvests. In addition, the shares of an\nunderlying ETF may trade at a premium or\ndiscount to their intrinsic value (i.e. , the\nmarket value may differ from the net asset\nvalue of an ETF's shares) for a number of\nreasons. For example, supply and demand for\nshares of an underlying ETF or market\ndisruptions may cause the market price of the\nunderlying ETF to deviate from the value of\nthe underlying ETF's investments, which may be\nexacerbated in less liquid markets. 24 Table\nof Contents Extension Risk. During periods of\nrising interest rates, the average life of\ncertain types of securities may be extended\nbecause of slower-than-expected principal\npayments. This may increase the period of time\nduring which an investment earns a below-\nmarket interest rate, increase the security's\nduration and reduce the value of the security.\nExtension risk may be heightened during\nperiods of adverse economic conditions\ngenerally, as payment rates decline due to\nhigher unemployment levels and other factors.\nFinancial Sector Risk. Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation which may limit both\nthe amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may\ncause an unusually high degree of volatility\nin the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to\nraise capital (such as the issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or cease operations.\nCredit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses\nassociated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or\npolitical developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage\nfinance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk\n. The net asset value of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund's securities holdings. The\nmarket prices of Fund Shares will generally\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nFund's net asset value and supply and demand\nof Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be\npredicted whether Fund Shares will trade\nbelow, at or above their net asset value.\nPrice differences may be due, in large part,\nto the fact that supply and demand forces at\nwork in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not\nidentical to, the same forces influencing the\nprices of the securities of the Index trading\nindividually or in the aggregate at any point\nin time. The market prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the net asset value\nof Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares\ncan be created and redeemed in Creation Units\n(unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable discounts\nfrom, and sometimes at premiums to, their net\nasset value), the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to the\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from the Fund's net asset value.\nIf an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a\ntime when the market price is at a discount to\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, then the\ninvestor may sustain losses. Geographic Focus\nRisk . The performance of a fund that is less\ndiversified across countries or geographic\nregions will be closely tied to market,\ncurrency, economic, political, environmental,\nor regulatory conditions and developments in\nthe countries or regions in which the fund\ninvests, and may be more volatile than the\nperformance of a more geographically-\ndiversified fund. Europe . The Economic and\nMonetary Union of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d)\nrequires compliance with restrictions on\ninflation rates, deficits, interest rates,\ndebt levels and fiscal and monetary controls,\neach of which may significantly affect every\ncountry in Europe. Decreasing imports or\nexports, changes in governmental or EU\nregulations on trade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro (the common currency of\ncertain EU countries), the default or threat\nof default by an EU member country on its\nsovereign debt, and/or an economic recession\nin an EU member country may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of EU member\ncountries and their trading partners. The\nEuropean financial markets have recently\nexperienced volatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic downturns or rising\ngovernment debt levels in several European\ncountries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy,\nPortugal and Spain. These events have\nadversely affected the exchange rate of the\neuro and may continue to significantly affect\nevery country in Europe, including countries\nthat do not use the euro. 25 Table of Contents\nResponses to the financial problems by\nEuropean governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results,\nmay result in social unrest and may limit\nfuture growth and economic recovery or have\nother unintended consequences. Further\ndefaults or restructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt could have\nadditional adverse effects on economies,\nfinancial markets and asset valuations around\nthe world. In addition, one or more countries\nmay abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. For example, in June 2016, citizens of the\nUnited Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave\nthe EU (known as \u201cBrexit\u201d), creating economic\nand political uncertainty in its wake and\nresulting in S&P downgrading the EU's credit\nrating from \u201cAA+\u201d to \u201cAA\u201d in the days\nfollowing the vote. The country's referendum\nvote sparked depreciation in the value of the\nBritish pound, short-term declines in the\nstock markets and heightened risk of continued\neconomic volatility worldwide. In March 2017,\nthe United Kingdom formally notified the\nEuropean Council of the United Kingdom's\nintention to withdraw from the EU pursuant to\nArticle 50 of the Treaty on European Union.\nThis formal notification began a multi-year\nperiod of negotiations regarding the terms of\nthe United Kingdom's exit from the EU, which\nformally occurred on January 31, 2020. The\nUnited Kingdom is currently in a transition\nperiod where it remains subject to EU rules\nbut has no role in the EU lawmaking process.\nDuring this transition period, United Kingdom\nand EU representatives are negotiating the\nprecise terms of their future relationship.\nThe transition period is scheduled to end on\nDecember 31, 2020. The full scope and nature\nof the consequences of the exit are not at\nthis time known and are unlikely to be known\nfor a significant period of time. It is also\nunknown whether the United Kingdom's exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist\nattacks and additional attacks may occur in\nthe future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty\nin financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure. Japan. The growth of\nJapan's economy has historically lagged that\nof its Asian neighbors and other major\ndeveloped economies. The Japanese economy is\nheavily dependent on international trade and\nhas been adversely affected by trade tariffs,\nother protectionist measures, competition from\nemerging economies and the economic conditions\nof its trading partners. China has become an\nimportant trading partner with Japan, yet the\ncountries' political relationship has become\nstrained. Should political tension increase,\nit could adversely affect the economy,\nespecially the export sector, and destabilize\nthe region as a whole. Japan also remains\nheavily dependent on oil imports, and higher\ncommodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the economy. The Japanese\neconomy faces several other concerns,\nincluding a financial system with large levels\nof nonperforming loans, over-leveraged\ncorporate balance sheets, extensive cross-\nownership by major corporations, a changing\ncorporate governance structure, and large\ngovernment deficits. These issues may cause a\nslowdown of the Japanese economy. The Japanese\nyen has fluctuated widely at times and any\nincrease in its value may cause a decline in\nexports that could weaken the Japanese\neconomy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in\nthe currency markets to attempt to maintain or\nreduce the value of the yen. Japanese\nintervention in the currency markets could\ncause the value of the yen to fluctuate\nsharply and unpredictably and could cause\nlosses to investors. Japan has an aging\nworkforce and has experienced a significant\npopulation decline in recent years. Japan's\nlabor market appears to be undergoing\nfundamental structural changes, as a labor\nmarket traditionally accustomed to lifetime\nemployment adjusts to meet the need for\nincreased labor mobility, which may adversely\naffect Japan's economic competitiveness. The\nnuclear power plant catastrophe in Japan in\nMarch 2011 may have short- and long-term\neffects on the Japanese economy and its\nnuclear energy industry. Natural disasters,\nsuch as earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons or\ntsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding\nareas and could negatively affect the Japanese\neconomy and, in turn, the Fund. United\nKingdom. The United Kingdom has one of the\nlargest economies in Europe, and the United\nStates and other European countries are\nsubstantial trading partners of the United\nKingdom. As a result, the British economy may\nbe impacted by changes to the economic\ncondition of the United States and other\nEuropean countries. The British economy, along\nwith certain other EU economies, experienced a\nsignificant economic slowdown during the\nrecent financial crisis, and certain British\nfinancial institutions suffered significant\nlosses, were severely under-capitalized and\nrequired government intervention to survive.\nThe British economy relies heavily on the\nexport of 26 Table of Contents\nfinancial services to the United States and   \nother European countries and, therefore, a    \nprolonged slowdown in the financial services  \nsector may have a negative impact on the      \nBritish economy. Continued governmental       \ninvolvement or control in certain sectors may \nstifle competition in certain sectors or cause\nadverse effects on economic growth. In the    \npast, the United Kingdom has been a target of \nterrorism. Acts of terrorism in the United    \nKingdom or against British interests abroad   \nmay cause uncertainty in the British financial\nmarkets and adversely affect the performance  \nof the issuers to which the Fund has exposure.\n                                              \nIn a referendum held on June 23, 2016,        \ncitizens of the United Kingdom voted to leave \nthe EU (known as \u201cBrexit\u201d), creating economic \nand political uncertainty in its wake. As a   \nresult of the referendum, S&P downgraded the  \nUnited Kingdom's credit rating from \u201cAAA\u201d to  \n\u201cAA\u201d in the days that followed the vote.\u00a0 The \ncountry's referendum vote sparked depreciation\nin the value of the British pound, short-term \ndeclines in the stock markets and heightened  \nrisk of continued economic volatility         \nworldwide. In March 2017, the United Kingdom  \nformally notified the European Council of the \nUnited Kingdom's intention to withdraw from   \nthe EU pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union. This formal notification began\na multi-year period of negotiations regarding \nthe terms of the United Kingdom's exit from   \nthe EU, which formally occurred on January 31,\n2020. The United Kingdom is currently in a    \ntransition period where it remains subject to \nEU rules but has no role in the EU lawmaking  \nprocess. During this transition period, United\nKingdom and EU representatives are negotiating\nthe precise terms of their future             \nrelationship. The transition period is        \nscheduled to end on December 31, 2020. There  \nis still considerable uncertainty relating to \nthe potential consequences associated with the\nexit, how the negotiations for the withdrawal \nand new trade agreements will be conducted,   \nand whether the United Kingdom's exit will    \nincrease the likelihood of other countries    \nalso departing the EU.\u00a0 Brexit may have a     \nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,     \nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new  \nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and        \npotentially lower economic growth for these   \neconomies that could potentially have an      \nadverse effect on the value of the\u00a0Fund's     \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \nIncome Risk. The Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors.   \nIssuers of securities held by the Fund may    \ncall or redeem the securities during periods  \nof falling interest rates, and the Fund would \nlikely be required to reinvest in securities  \npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation \nheld by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other           \nobligations paying income at lower rates. A   \nreduction in the income earned by the Fund may\nlimit the Fund's ability to achieve its       \nobjective.                                    \n                                              \nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk . The   \nFund is managed with an indexing investment   \nstrategy, attempting to track the performance \nof an unmanaged index of securities. The Fund \nwill seek to replicate Index returns,         \nregardless of the current or projected        \nperformance of the Index or of the actual     \nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs \nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. The    \nFund generally will buy and will not sell a   \nsecurity included in the Index as long as the \nsecurity is part of the Index regardless of   \nany sudden or material decline in value or    \nforeseeable material decline in value of the  \nsecurity, even though the Adviser may make a  \ndifferent investment decision for other       \nactively managed accounts or portfolios that  \nhold the security. As a result, the Fund's    \nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms and  \nby comparison with other indices) and,        \nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index \ncomputations or the construction of the Index \nin accordance with its methodology may occur  \nfrom time to time and may not be identified   \nand corrected by the Index Provider for a     \nperiod of time or at all, which may have an   \nadverse impact on the Fund and its            \nshareholders. While the Adviser seeks to track\nthe performance of the Index (i.e., achieve a \nhigh degree of correlation with the Index),   \nthe Fund's return may not match the return of \nthe Index for a number of reasons. For        \nexample, the return on the sample of          \nsecurities purchased by the Fund (or the      \nreturn on securities not included in the      \nIndex) to replicate the performance of the    \nIndex may not correlate precisely with the    \nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number \nof operating expenses not applicable to the   \nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling \nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be  \nfully invested at times, either as a result of\ncash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves\nof cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. \nThe Adviser may attempt to track the Index    \nreturn by investing in fewer than all of the  \nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially        \nincreasing the risk of divergence between the \nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes  \nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact the Fund's       \nability to match the return of the Index. The \nAdviser may apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or    \ninvestment techniques to refine or limit the  \nnumber or types of                            \n                      27                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nissuers included in the Index in which the    \nFund may invest. Application of such screens  \nor techniques may result in investment        \nperformance below that of the Index and may   \nnot produce results expected by the Adviser.  \nIndex tracking risk may be heightened during  \ntimes of increased market volatility or other \nunusual market conditions.                    \n                                              \nPursuant to the Index methodology, a security \nmay be removed from\u00a0the Index in the event    \nthat it does not comply with the eligibility  \nrequirements of the Index. As a result, the   \nFund may be forced to sell securities at      \ninopportune times and/or unfavorable prices   \ndue to these changes in the Index components. \nWhen there are changes made to the component  \nsecurities of the Index and the Fund in turn  \nmakes similar changes to its portfolio to     \nattempt to increase the correlation between   \nthe Fund's portfolio and the Index, any       \ntransaction costs and market exposure arising \nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne     \ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders.    \nUnscheduled changes to\u00a0the Index may expose   \nthe Fund to additional tracking error risk.   \nThe Fund may recognize gains as a result of   \nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities  \nholdings to reflect changes in the securities \nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be   \nrequired to distribute any such gains to its  \nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income  \ntax consequences.                             \n                                              \nIndustrial Sector Risk . Industrial companies \nare affected by supply and demand both for    \ntheir specific product or service and for     \nindustrial sector products in general.        \nGovernment regulation, world events, exchange \nrates and economic conditions, technological  \ndevelopments and liabilities for environmental\ndamage and general civil liabilities will     \nlikewise affect the performance of these      \ncompanies. Aerospace and defense companies, a \ncomponent of the industrial sector, can be    \nsignificantly affected by government spending \npolicies because companies involved in this   \nindustry rely, to a significant extent, on    \nU.S. and foreign government demand for their  \nproducts and services. Thus, the financial    \ncondition of, and investor interest in,       \naerospace and defense companies are heavily   \ninfluenced by governmental defense spending   \npolicies which are typically under pressure   \nfrom efforts to control the U.S. (and other)  \ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities,\na component of the industrial sector, are     \ncyclical and have occasional sharp price      \nmovements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and    \ninsurance costs.                              \n                                              \nInflation-Indexed Securities Risk . The       \nprincipal amount of an inflation-indexed      \nsecurity typically increases with inflation   \nand decreases with deflation, as measured by a\nspecified index. It is possible that, in a    \nperiod of declining inflation rates, the Fund \ncould receive at maturity less than the       \ninitial principal amount of an inflation-     \nindexed security. Although the holders of U.S.\nTIPS receive no less than the par value of the\nsecurity at maturity, if the Fund purchases   \nU.S. TIPS in the secondary market whose       \nprincipal values have previously been adjusted\nupward and there is a period of subsequent    \ndeclining inflation rates, the Fund may       \nreceive at maturity less than it invested.    \nDepending on the changes in inflation rates   \nduring the period the Fund holds an inflation-\nindexed security, the Fund may earn less on   \nthe security than on a conventional bond. The \nprincipal amounts of inflation-indexed        \nsecurities are typically only adjusted        \nperiodically, and changes in the values of the\nsecurities may only approximately reflect     \nchanges in inflation rates and may occur      \nsubstantially after the changes in inflation  \nrates in question occur.                      \n                                              \nInterest Rate Risk . Interest rate risk is the\nrisk that the securities held by the Fund will\ndecline in value because of increases in      \nmarket interest rates. Duration is a measure  \nused to determine the sensitivity of a        \nsecurity's price to changes in interest rates.\nDebt securities with longer durations tend to \nbe more sensitive to changes in interest      \nrates, usually making them more volatile than \ndebt securities with shorter durations. For   \nexample, the value of a security with a       \nduration of five years would be expected to   \ndecrease by 5% for every 1% increase in       \ninterest rates. Falling interest rates also   \ncreate the potential for a decline in the     \nFund's income and yield. Interest-only and    \nprincipal-only securities are especially      \nsensitive to interest rate changes, which can \naffect not only their prices but can also     \nchange the income flows and repayment         \nassumptions about those investments. Variable \nand floating rate securities also generally   \nincrease or decrease in value in response to  \nchanges in interest rates, although generally \nto a lesser degree than fixed-rate securities.\nA substantial increase in interest rates may  \nalso have an adverse impact on the liquidity  \nof a security, especially those with longer   \ndurations. Interest rate changes can be sudden\nand unpredictable, and are influenced by a    \nnumber of factors, including government       \npolicy, monetary policy, inflation            \nexpectations, perceptions of risk, and supply \nand demand for bonds. Changes in government or\ncentral bank policy, including changes in tax \npolicy or changes in a central bank's         \nimplementation of specific policy goals, may  \nhave a substantial impact on interest rates.  \nThis could lead to heightened levels of       \ninterest rate, volatility and liquidity risks \nfor the fixed income markets generally and    \ncould have a substantial and immediate effect \non the values of the Fund's investments. There\ncan be no guarantee that any particular       \ngovernment or central bank policy will be     \ncontinued, discontinued or changed, nor that  \nany such policy will have the desired effect  \non interest rates.                            \n                      28                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nLender Liability Risk . A number of U.S.      \njudicial decisions have upheld judgments of   \nborrowers against lending institutions on the \nbasis of various evolving legal theories,     \ncollectively termed \u201clender liability.\u201d       \nGenerally, lender liability is founded on the \npremise that a lender has violated a duty     \n(whether implied or contractual) of good      \nfaith, commercial reasonableness and fair     \ndealing, or a similar duty owed to the        \nborrower or has assumed an excessive degree of\ncontrol over the borrower resulting in the    \ncreation of a fiduciary duty owed to the      \nborrower or its other creditors or            \nshareholders. Because of the nature of its    \ninvestments, the Fund may be subject to       \nallegations of lender liability.              \n                                              \nIn addition, under common law principles that \nin some cases form the basis for lender       \nliability claims, if a lender or bondholder   \n(a) intentionally takes an action that results\nin the undercapitalization of a borrower to   \nthe detriment of other creditors of such      \nborrower; (b) engages in other inequitable    \nconduct to the detriment of such other        \ncreditors; (c) engages in fraud with respect  \nto, or makes misrepresentations to, such other\ncreditors or (d) uses its influence as a      \nstockholder to dominate or control a borrower \nto the detriment of other creditors of such   \nborrower, a court may elect to subordinate the\nclaim of the offending lender or bondholder to\nthe claims of the disadvantaged creditor or   \ncreditors, a remedy called \u201cequitable         \nsubordination.\u201d                               \n                                              \nBecause affiliates of, or persons related to, \nthe Adviser or GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds    \nManagement LLC\u00a0, the investment sub-adviser to\nthe SPDR Blackstone / GSO Senior Loan ETF, may\nhold equity or other interests in obligors of \nthe Fund, the Fund could be exposed to claims \nfor equitable subordination or lender         \nliability or both based on such equity or     \nother holdings.                               \n                                              \nLeveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,     \nreverse repurchase agreements, certain        \nderivatives transactions, securities lending  \ntransactions and other investment transactions\nsuch as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or     \nforward commitment transactions may create    \ninvestment leverage. If the Fund engages in   \ntransactions that have a leveraging effect on \nthe Fund's investment portfolio, the value of \nthe Fund will be potentially more volatile and\nall other risks will tend to be compounded.   \nThis is because leverage generally creates    \ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base \nof assets than the Fund would otherwise have  \nand so magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to  \nbe a speculative investment practice and may  \nresult in losses to the Fund. Certain         \nderivatives have the potential for unlimited  \nloss, regardless of the size of the initial   \ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause the \nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,   \ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to \nmeet asset segregation or coverage            \nrequirements.                                 \n                                              \nLIBOR Risk . On July 27, 2017, the United     \nKingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which  \nregulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to \nphase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. There     \nremains uncertainty regarding the future of   \nLIBOR and whether it will continue to exist in\nits current, or a modified, form. There is    \nalso uncertainty surrounding the nature of any\nreplacement rate. Certain alternatives to     \nLIBOR have been established or are in         \ndevelopment in most major currencies,         \nincluding the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(SOFR), which is intended to replace the U.S. \nDollar LIBOR. The replacement and/or          \ndiscontinuation of LIBOR could lead to        \nsignificant short-term and long-term          \nuncertainty and market instability. The       \nunavailability and/or discontinuation of LIBOR\ncould have adverse impacts on newly issued    \nfinancial instruments and existing financial  \ninstruments that reference LIBOR. While some  \ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where  \nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for \nan alternative rate setting methodology, not  \nall instruments may have such provisions and  \nthere is uncertainty regarding the            \neffectiveness of any alternative methodology. \nAbandonment of or modifications to LIBOR could\nlead to significant short-term and long-term  \nuncertainty and market instability. In        \naddition, the unavailability or replacement of\nLIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or      \nreturn on certain Fund investments and may    \nresult in costs incurred in connection with   \nclosing out positions and entering into new   \ntrades. Any pricing adjustments to the Fund's \ninvestments resulting from a substitute       \nreference rate may also adversely affect the  \nFund's performance and/or NAV.                \n                                              \nLiquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk   \nthat the Fund may not be able to dispose of   \nsecurities or close out derivatives           \ntransactions readily at a favorable time or   \nprices (or at all) or at prices approximating \nthose at which the Fund currently values them.\nFor example, certain investments may be       \nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade  \nin the over-the-counter market or in limited  \nvolume, or may not have an active trading     \nmarket. Illiquid securities may trade at a    \ndiscount from comparable, more liquid         \ninvestments and may be subject to wide        \nfluctuations in market value. It may be       \ndifficult for the Fund to value illiquid      \nsecurities accurately. The market for certain \ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse \nmarket or economic conditions independent of  \nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a                                          \n                      29                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nparticular issuer. Disposal of illiquid       \nsecurities may entail registration expenses   \nand other transaction costs that are higher   \nthan those for liquid securities. The Fund may\nseek to borrow money to meet its obligations  \n(including among other things redemption      \nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of    \nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing  \nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund. \n                                              \nLow Short-Term Interest Rates Risk . During   \nmarket conditions in which short-term interest\nrates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can \nbe very low, and the Fund may have a negative \nyield ( i.e. , it may lose money on an        \noperating basis). During these conditions, it \nis possible that the Fund will generate an    \ninsufficient amount of income to pay its      \nexpenses, and will not be able to pay its     \nscheduled dividend. In addition, it is        \npossible that during these conditions the Fund\nmay experience difficulties purchasing and/or \nselling securities with respect to scheduled  \nrebalances, and may, as a result, maintain a  \nportion of its assets in cash, on which it may\nearn little, if any, income. Such market      \nconditions may adversely affect the Fund's    \nability to achieve a high degree of           \ncorrelation with its Index.                   \n                                              \nManagement Risk . The judgments of an         \nactively-managed fund's adviser about the     \nattractiveness, relative value, or potential  \nappreciation of a particular sector, security,\ncommodity or investment strategy may prove to \nbe incorrect, and may cause such fund to incur\nlosses. There can be no assurance that the    \ninvestment techniques and decisions of the    \nadviser will produce the desired results.     \n                                              \nMarket Risk . Market prices of investments    \nheld by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes\nrapidly or unpredictably. The Fund's          \ninvestments are subject to changes in general \neconomic conditions, general market           \nfluctuations and the risks inherent in        \ninvestment in securities markets. Investment  \nmarkets can be volatile, and prices of        \ninvestments can change substantially due to   \nvarious factors including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in      \ninterest rates, changes in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in  \nthe Fund could decline if the particular      \nindustries, sectors or companies in which the \nFund invests do not perform well or are       \nadversely affected by events. Further, legal, \npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities  \nprices. Local, regional or global events such \nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of      \ninfectious illness or other public health     \nissues, or other events could have a          \nsignificant impact on the Fund and its        \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \nAn outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by\na novel coronavirus (known as COVID-19) first \ndetected in China in December 2019 has        \nresulted in a global pandemic and major       \ndisruptions to economies and markets around   \nthe world, including the United States.       \nFinancial markets have experienced extreme    \nvolatility and severe losses, and trading in  \nmany instruments has been disrupted. Liquidity\nfor many instruments has been greatly reduced \nfor periods of time. Some interest rates are  \nvery low and in some cases yields are         \nnegative. Governments and central banks,      \nincluding the Federal Reserve in the United   \nStates, have taken extraordinary and          \nunprecedented actions to support local and    \nglobal economies and the financial markets.   \nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some \ntime. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19,  \nand measures taken to mitigate its effects,   \ncould result in disruptions to the services   \nprovided to the Fund by its service providers.\n                                              \nMomentum Risk . The Fund employs a \u201cmomentum\u201d \nstyle of investing that emphasizes investing  \nin securities that have had higher recent     \nprice performance compared to other           \nsecurities. This style of investing is subject\nto the risk that these securities may be more \nvolatile than a broad cross-section of        \nsecurities or that the returns on securities  \nthat have previously exhibited price momentum \nare less than returns on other styles of      \ninvesting or the overall stock market.        \nMomentum can turn quickly and cause           \nsignificant variation from other types of     \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \nMoney Market Risk . An investment in a money  \nmarket fund is not a deposit of any bank and  \nis not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or   \nany other government agency. Certain money    \nmarket funds seek to preserve the value of    \ntheir shares at $1.00 per share, although     \nthere can be no assurance that they will do   \nso, and it is possible to lose money by       \ninvesting in such a money market fund. A major\nor unexpected change in interest rates or a   \ndecline in the credit quality of an issuer or \nentity providing credit support, an inactive  \ntrading market for money market instruments,  \nor adverse market, economic, industry,        \npolitical, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause the share price of such\na money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will   \nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at \ntimes when the fair value of the money market \nfund's portfolio per share is more or less    \nthan $1.00. None of State Street Corporation, \nState Street, State Street Global Advisors    \n(\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (\u201cState \nStreet Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an   \ninvestment in a money market fund at $1.00 per\nshare. Investors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from   \nState Street Entities.                        \n                      30                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nOther money market funds price and transact at\na \u201cfloating\u201d NAV that will fluctuate along    \nwith changes in the market-based value of fund\nassets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV  \nmay be worth more or less than their original \npurchase price. Recent changes in the         \nregulation of money market funds may affect   \nthe operations and structures of money market \nfunds. A money market fund may be permitted or\nrequired to impose redemption fees or to      \nimpose limitations on redemptions during      \nperiods of high illiquidity in the markets for\nthe investments held by it.                   \n                                              \nMortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed       \nSecurities Risk . Investments in mortgage-    \nrelated and other asset-backed securities are \nsubject to the risk of significant credit     \ndowngrades, illiquidity, and defaults to a    \ngreater extent than many other types of fixed \nincome investments. The liquidity of mortgage-\nrelated and asset-backed securities may change\nover time. Mortgage-related securities        \nrepresent a participation in, or are secured  \nby, mortgage loans. Other asset-backed        \nsecurities are typically structured like      \nmortgage-related securities, but instead of   \nmortgage loans or interests in mortgage loans,\nthe underlying assets may include, for        \nexample, items such as motor vehicle          \ninstallment sales or installment loan         \ncontracts, leases on various types of real and\npersonal property, and receivables from credit\ncard agreements. During periods of falling    \ninterest rates, mortgage-related and other    \nasset-backed securities, which typically      \nprovide the issuer with the right to prepay   \nthe security prior to maturity, may be        \nprepaid, which may result in the Fund having  \nto reinvest the proceeds in other investments \nat lower interest rates. During periods of    \nrising interest rates, the average life of    \nmortgage-related and other asset-backed       \nsecurities may extend because of slower-than  \nexpected principal payments. This may lock in \na below market interest rate, increase the    \nsecurity's duration and interest rate         \nsensitivity, and reduce the value of the      \nsecurity. As a result, mortgage-related and   \nother asset-backed securities may have less   \npotential for capital appreciation during     \nperiods of declining interest rates than other\ndebt securities of comparable maturities,     \nalthough they may have a similar risk of      \ndecline in market values during periods of    \nrising interest rates. Prepayment rates are   \ndifficult to predict and the potential impact \nof prepayments on the value of a mortgage-    \nrelated or other asset-backed security depends\non the terms of the instrument and can result \nin significant volatility. The price of a     \nmortgage-related or other asset-backed        \nsecurity also depends on the credit quality   \nand adequacy of the underlying assets or      \ncollateral. Defaults on the underlying assets,\nif any, may impair the value of a mortgage-   \nrelated or other asset-backed security. For   \nsome asset-backed securities in which the Fund\ninvests, such as those backed by credit card  \nreceivables, the underlying cash flows may not\nbe supported by a security interest in a      \nrelated asset. Moreover, the values of        \nmortgage-related and other asset-backed       \nsecurities may be substantially dependent on  \nthe servicing of the underlying asset pools,  \nand are therefore subject to risks associated \nwith the negligence or malfeasance by their   \nservicers and to the credit risk of their     \nservicers. In certain situations, the         \nmishandling of related documentation may also \naffect the rights of securities holders in and\nto the underlying collateral. There may be    \nlegal and practical limitations on the        \nenforceability of any security interest       \ngranted with respect to underlying assets, or \nthe value of the underlying assets, if any,   \nmay be insufficient if the issuer defaults.   \n                                              \nIn a \u201cforward roll\u201d transaction,\u00a0the Fund will\nsell a mortgage-related security to a bank or \nother permitted entity and simultaneously     \nagree to purchase a similar security from the \ninstitution at a later date at an agreed upon \nprice. The mortgage securities that are       \npurchased will bear the same interest rate as \nthose sold, but generally will be             \ncollateralized by different pools of mortgages\nwith different prepayment histories than those\nsold. The values of such transactions will be \naffected by many of the same factors that     \naffect the values of mortgage-related         \nsecurities generally. In addition, forward    \nroll transactions may have the effect of      \ncreating investment leverage in\u00a0the Fund.     \n                                              \nMunicipal Obligations Risk. The U.S. municipal\nsecurities market is volatile and can be      \nsignificantly affected by adverse tax,        \nlegislative, or political changes and the     \nfinancial condition of the issuers of         \nmunicipal securities. Municipal obligations   \ninclude revenue obligations, which are        \ngenerally backed by the revenues generated    \nfrom a specific project or facility and       \ninclude private activity bonds and industrial \ndevelopment bonds. Private activity and       \nindustrial development bonds are dependent on \nthe ability of the facility's user to meet its\nfinancial obligations and on the value of any \nreal or personal property pledged as security \nfor such payment. Private activity and        \nindustrial development bonds, although issued \nby industrial development authorities, may be \nbacked only by the assets of the non-         \ngovernmental user. Because many municipal     \nsecurities are issued to finance projects     \nrelating to education, health care,           \ntransportation and utilities, conditions in   \nthose sectors can affect the overall municipal\nsecurities market. In addition, municipal     \nsecurities backed by current or anticipated   \nrevenues from a specific project or specific  \nasset can be negatively affected by the       \ndiscontinuance or reduction in the rate of the\ntaxation supporting the project or asset or   \nthe inability to collect revenues for the     \nproject or from the assets. If the U.S.       \nInternal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d)          \ndetermines the issuer of a municipal security \nhas not complied with applicable tax          \nrequirements, interest from the security could\nbecome taxable, and the security could decline\nin value. Municipal obligations may also be   \nsubject to                                    \n                      31                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nprepayment risk and extension risk. Certain   \nstates and other governmental entities have   \nexperienced, and may continue to experience,  \nextreme financial pressures in response to    \nfinancial, economic and other factors, and may\nbe, or be perceived to be, unable to meet all \nof their obligations under municipal bonds    \nissued or guaranteed by them; such factors may\nresult in substantial volatility in municipal \nsecurities markets and losses to the          \ncorresponding Fund. Additionally, the Fund's  \nportfolio may have greater exposure to        \nliquidity risk since the markets for such     \nsecurities may be less liquid than the        \ntraditional bond markets. There may also be   \nless information available on the financial   \ncondition of issuers of these types of        \nsecurities than for public corporations. This \nmeans that it may be harder to buy and sell   \nsuch securities, especially on short notice,  \nand these securities may be more difficult for\nthe Fund to value accurately than securities  \nof public corporations.                       \n                                              \nNon-Diversification Risk . To the extent the  \nFund is or becomes \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller number of portfolio        \nsecurities than many other funds. To the      \nextent the Fund invests in a relatively small \nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market    \nvalue of a particular security held by the    \nFund may affect its value more than if it     \ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The   \nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified      \nfunds. The Fund may become non-diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of changes \nin the composition of the Index (e.g., changes\nin weightings of one or more component        \nsecurities).                                  \n                                              \nNon-Senior Loans and Other Debt Securities    \nRisk . Secured loans that are not first lien, \nloans that are unsecured and debt securities  \nare subject to many of the same risks that    \naffect Senior Loans; however they are often   \nunsecured and/or lower in the issuer's capital\nstructure than Senior Loans, and thus may be  \nexposed to greater risk of default and lower  \nrecoveries in the event of a default. This    \nrisk can be further heightened in the case of \nbelow investment-grade instruments.           \nAdditionally, most fixed-income securities are\nfixed-rate and thus are generally more        \nsusceptible than floating rate loans to price \nvolatility related to changes in prevailing   \ninterest rates.                               \n                                              \nNon-U.S. Securities Risk . Investments in     \nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers entail risks   \nnot typically associated with investing in    \nsecurities of U.S. issuers. Similar risks may \napply to securities traded on a U.S.          \nsecurities exchange that are issued by        \nentities with significant exposure to non-U.S.\ncountries. In certain countries, legal        \nremedies available to investors may be more   \nlimited than those available with regard to   \nU.S. investments. Because non-U.S. securities \nare typically denominated and traded in       \ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, the    \nvalue of the Fund's assets, to the extent they\nare non-U.S. dollar denominated, may be       \naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency \nexchange rates, exchange control regulations, \nand delays, restrictions or prohibitions on   \nthe repatriation of non-U.S. currencies. To   \nthe extent underlying securities held by the  \nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are      \nclosed when the exchange on which the Fund's  \nshares trade is open, there may be deviations \nbetween the current price of an underlying    \nsecurity and the last quoted price for the    \nunderlying security on the closed foreign     \nmarket. These deviations could result in the  \nFund experiencing premiums or discounts       \ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in     \ndomestic securities. Income and gains with    \nrespect to investments in certain countries   \nmay be subject to withholding and other taxes.\nThere may be less information publicly        \navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are   \nnot subject to accounting, auditing, and      \nfinancial reporting standards, regulatory     \nframework and practices comparable to those in\nthe United States. The securities of some     \nnon-U.S. entities are less liquid and at times\nmore volatile than securities of comparable   \nU.S. entities, and could become subject to    \nsanctions or embargoes that adversely affect  \nthe Fund's investment. Non-U.S. transaction   \ncosts, such as brokerage commissions and      \ncustody costs may be higher than in the U.S.  \nIn addition, there may be a possibility of    \nnationalization or expropriation of assets,   \nimposition of currency exchange controls,     \nconfiscatory taxation, and diplomatic         \ndevelopments that could adversely affect the  \nvalues of the Fund's investments in certain   \nnon-U.S. countries. Investments in securities \nof non-U.S. issuers also are subject to       \nforeign political and economic risk not       \nassociated with U.S. investments, meaning that\npolitical events (civil unrest, national      \nelections, changes in political conditions and\nforeign relations, imposition of exchange     \ncontrols and repatriation restrictions),      \nsocial and economic events (labor strikes,    \nrising inflation) and natural disasters       \noccurring in a country where the Fund invests \ncould cause the Fund's investments in that    \ncountry to experience gains or losses. Certain\ncountries have recently experienced (or       \ncurrently are expected to experience) negative\ninterest rates on certain fixed-income        \nsecurities, and similar interest rate         \nconditions may be experienced in other        \nregions. Investments in fixed-income          \nsecurities with very low or negative interest \nrates may magnify the Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and     \nperformance, and such investments may be      \nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced  \nliquidity.                                    \n                      32                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nPolitical Risk. A significant restructuring of\nfederal income tax rates or even serious      \ndiscussion on the topic in Congress could     \ncause municipal bond prices to fall. The      \ndemand for municipal securities is strongly   \ninfluenced by the value of tax-exempt income  \nto investors. Lower income tax rates could    \nreduce the advantage of owning municipals.    \n                                              \nPortfolio Turnover Risk . The Fund may engage \nin frequent trading of its portfolio          \nsecurities. Fund turnover generally involves a\nnumber of direct and indirect costs and       \nexpenses to the Fund, including, for example, \nbrokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and    \nbid/asked spreads, and transaction costs on   \nthe sale of securities and reinvestment in    \nother securities. The costs related to        \nincreased portfolio turnover have the effect  \nof reducing the Fund's investment return, and \nthe sale of securities by the Fund may result \nin the realization of taxable capital gains,  \nincluding short-term capital gains. The Fund  \nmay engage in frequent trading of its         \nportfolio securities in connection with Index \nrebalancing. Frequent trading may cause the   \nFund to incur additional transaction costs and\nexperience different tax consequences in      \ncomparison to an ETF that does not engage in  \nfrequent trading.                             \n                                              \nPreferred Securities Risk . Generally,        \npreferred security holders have no or limited \nvoting rights with respect to the issuing     \ncompany. In addition, preferred securities are\nsubordinated to bonds and other debt          \ninstruments in a company's capital structure  \nand therefore will be subject to greater      \ncredit risk than those debt instruments.      \nUnlike debt securities, dividend payments on a\npreferred security typically must be declared \nby the issuer's board of directors. An        \nissuer's board of directors is generally not  \nunder any obligation to pay a dividend (even  \nif such dividends have accrued), and may      \nsuspend payment of dividends on preferred     \nsecurities at any time. Therefore, in the     \nevent an issuer of preferred securities       \nexperiences economic difficulties, the        \nissuer's preferred securities may lose        \nsubstantial value due to the reduced          \nlikelihood that the issuer's board of         \ndirectors will declare a dividend and the fact\nthat the preferred security may be            \nsubordinated to other securities of the same  \nissuer. Further, because many preferred       \nsecurities pay dividends at a fixed rate,     \ntheir market price can be sensitive to changes\nin interest rates in a manner similar to bonds\n- that is, as interest rates rise, the value  \nof the preferred securities held by the Fund  \nare likely to decline. Therefore, to the      \nextent that the Fund invests a substantial    \nportion of its assets in fixed rate preferred \nsecurities, rising interest rates may cause   \nthe value of the Fund's investments to decline\nsignificantly. In addition, because many      \npreferred securities allow holders to convert \nthe preferred securities into common stock of \nthe issuer, their market price can be         \nsensitive to changes in the value of the      \nissuer's common stock and, therefore,         \ndeclining common stock values may also cause  \nthe value of the Fund's investments to        \ndecline. Preferred securities often have call \nfeatures which allow the issuer to redeem the \nsecurity at its discretion. The redemption of \na preferred security having a higher than     \naverage yield may cause a decrease in the     \nFund's yield.                                 \n                                              \nReinvestment Risk. Income from the Fund's     \nportfolio may decline when the Fund invests   \nthe proceeds from investment income, sales of \nportfolio securities or matured, traded or    \ncalled debt obligations. For instance, during \nperiods of declining interest rates, an issuer\nof debt obligations may exercise an option to \nredeem securities prior to maturity, forcing  \nthe Fund to reinvest the proceeds in lower-   \nyielding securities. A decline in income      \nreceived by the Fund from its investments is  \nlikely to have a negative effect on the yield \nand total return of the Fund Shares.          \n                                              \nRestricted Securities Risk . The Fund may hold\nsecurities that have not been registered for  \nsale to the public under the U.S. federal     \nsecurities laws pursuant to an exemption from \nregistration. These securities may be less    \nliquid than securities registered for sale to \nthe general public. The liquidity of a        \nrestricted security may be affected by a      \nnumber of factors, including, among others:   \n(i) the creditworthiness of the issuer; (ii)  \nthe frequency of trades and quotes for the    \nsecurity; (iii) the number of dealers willing \nto purchase or sell the security and the      \nnumber of other potential purchasers; (iv)    \ndealer undertakings to make a market in the   \nsecurity; (v) the nature of any legal         \nrestrictions governing trading in the         \nsecurity; and (vi) the nature of the security \nand the nature of marketplace trades. There   \ncan be no assurance that a liquid trading     \nmarket will exist at any time for any         \nparticular restricted security. Also,         \nrestricted securities may be difficult to     \nvalue because market quotations may not be    \nreadily available, and the securities may have\nsignificant volatility.                       \n                                              \nRisks of Loan Assignments and Participations. \nThe Fund, as the purchaser of an assignment,  \ntypically succeeds to all the rights and      \nobligations of the assigning institution and  \nbecomes a lender under the credit agreement   \nwith respect to the debt obligation. However, \nthe Fund may not be able to unilaterally      \nenforce all rights and remedies under the loan\nand with regard to any associated collateral. \nBecause assignments may be arranged through   \nprivate negotiations between potential        \nassignees and potential assignors, the rights \nand obligations acquired by the Fund as the   \npurchaser of an assignment may differ from,   \nand be more limited than, those held by the   \nassigning lender. In addition, if the loan is \nforeclosed, the Fund could become a partial   \nowner of any collateral and could bear the    \ncosts and liabilities of                      \n                      33                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nowning and disposing of the collateral. The   \nFund may be required to pass along to a       \npurchaser that buys a loan from the Fund by   \nway of assignment, a portion of any fees to   \nwhich the Fund is entitled under the loan.    \nWhen purchasing participations, the Fund      \ngenerally will have no right to enforce       \ncompliance by the borrower with the terms of  \nthe loan agreement relating to the loan, nor  \nany rights of set-off against the borrower,   \nand the Fund may not directly benefit from any\ncollateral supporting the loan in which it has\npurchased the participation. As a result, the \nFund will be subject to the credit risk of    \nboth the borrower and the lender that is      \nselling the participation. In the event of the\ninsolvency of the lender selling a            \nparticipation, the Fund may be treated as a   \ngeneral creditor of the lender and may not    \nbenefit from any set-off between the lender   \nand the borrower.                             \n                                              \nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend    \nportfolio securities in an amount not to      \nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the  \nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any \ntime. Any such loans must be continuously     \nsecured by collateral maintained on a current \nbasis in an amount at least equal to the      \nmarket value of the securities loaned by the  \nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a \nloan transaction, as compensation for lending \nits securities, the Fund will receive a       \nportion of the dividends or interest accrued  \non the securities held as collateral or, in   \nthe case of cash collateral, a portion of the \nincome from the investment of such cash. In   \naddition, the Fund will receive the amount of \nall dividends, interest and other             \ndistributions on the loaned securities.       \nHowever, the borrower has the right to vote   \nthe loaned securities. The Fund will call     \nloans to vote proxies if a material issue     \naffecting the investment is to be voted upon. \nEfforts to recall such securities promptly may\nbe unsuccessful, especially for foreign       \nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and   \nmay involve expenses to the Fund. Securities  \nlending involves the risk that the Fund may   \nlose money because the borrower of the loaned \nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. Should the borrower  \nof the securities fail financially, the Fund  \nmay experience delays in recovering the       \nsecurities or exercising its rights in the    \ncollateral. Loans are made only to borrowers  \nthat are deemed by the securities lending     \nagent to be of good financial standing. In a  \nloan transaction, the Fund will also bear the \nrisk of any decline in value of securities    \nprovided as collateral or acquired with cash  \ncollateral. The Fund will attempt to minimize \nthis risk by limiting the investment of cash  \ncollateral to high quality instruments of     \nshort maturity either directly on behalf of   \nthe lending Fund or through one or more joint \naccounts or funds, which may include those    \nmanaged by the Adviser. To the extent the     \ncollateral provided or investments made with  \ncash collateral differ from securities        \nincluded in an Index, such collateral or      \ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss   \nthan the securities included in the Index. In \naddition, the Fund will be subject to the risk\nthat any income generated by lending its      \nsecurities or reinvesting cash collateral is  \nlower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay\na borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute  \npayments for dividends when overseeing the    \nFund's securities lending activity.           \n                                              \nSenior Loan Risk. Investments in Senior Loans \nare subject to credit risk and general        \ninvestment risk. Credit risk refers to the    \npossibility that the borrower of a Senior Loan\nwill be unable and/or unwilling to make timely\ninterest payments and/or repay the principal  \non its obligation. Default in the payment of  \ninterest or principal on a Senior Loan will   \nresult in a reduction in the value of the     \nSenior Loan and consequently a reduction in   \nthe value of the Fund's investments and a     \npotential decrease in the NAV of the Fund.    \nSenior Loans are also subject to the risk that\nthe value of the collateral securing a Senior \nLoan may decline, be insufficient to meet the \nobligations of the borrower or be difficult to\nliquidate. In addition, the Fund's access to  \nthe collateral may be limited by bankruptcy or\nother insolvency laws. Further, loans held by \nthe Fund may not be considered securities and,\ntherefore, purchasers, such as the Fund, may  \nnot be entitled to rely on the strong anti-   \nfraud protections of the federal securities   \nlaws. Some Senior Loans are subject to the    \nrisk that a court, pursuant to fraudulent     \nconveyance or other similar laws, could       \nsubordinate the Senior Loans to presently     \nexisting or future indebtedness of the        \nborrower or take other action detrimental to  \nlenders, including the Fund, such as          \ninvalidation of Senior Loans or causing       \ninterest previously paid to be refunded to the\nborrower. Senior Loans are also subject to    \nhigh yield securities risks and liquidity     \nrisks described above. In addition, bank loans\nmay be subject to extended settlement periods,\nwhich may impair the Fund's ability to sell or\nrealize the full value of its loans in the    \nevent of a need to liquidate such loans in a  \ncompressed period of time. Some of the loans  \nin which the Fund may invest or obtain        \nexposure to may be \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d loans.     \nCovenant-lite loans may contain fewer or no   \nmaintenance covenants compared to other loans \nand may not include terms which allow the     \nlender to monitor the performance of the      \nborrower and declare a default if certain     \ncriteria are breached. The Fund may experience\nrelatively greater realized or unrealized     \nlosses or delays in enforcing its rights on   \nits holdings of covenant-lite loans than its  \nholdings of loans with the usual covenants.   \n                      34                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nSettlement Risk . Markets in different        \ncountries have different clearance and        \nsettlement procedures and in certain markets  \nthere have been times when settlements have   \nbeen unable to keep pace with the volume of   \ntransactions. Delays in settlement may        \nincrease credit risk to the Fund, limit the   \nability of the Fund to reinvest the proceeds  \nof a sale of securities, hinder the ability of\nthe Fund to lend its portfolio securities, and\npotentially subject the Fund to penalties for \nits failure to deliver to on-purchasers of    \nsecurities whose delivery to the Fund was     \ndelayed. Delays in the settlement of          \nsecurities purchased by the Fund may limit the\nability of the Fund to sell those securities  \nat times and prices it considers desirable,   \nand may subject the Fund to losses and costs  \ndue to its own inability to settle with       \nsubsequent purchasers of the securities from  \nit. The Fund may be required to borrow monies \nit had otherwise expected to receive in       \nconnection with the settlement of securities  \nsold by it, in order to meet its obligations  \nto others. Limits on the ability of the Fund  \nto purchase or sell securities due to         \nsettlement delays could increase any variance \nbetween the Fund's performance and that of its\nbenchmark index.                              \n                                              \nSovereign Debt Obligations Risk . Investments \nin debt securities issued by governments or by\ngovernment agencies and instrumentalities     \ninvolve the risk that the governmental        \nentities responsible for repayment may be     \nunable or unwilling to pay interest and repay \nprincipal when due. A governmental entity's   \nwillingness or ability to pay interest and    \nrepay principal in a timely manner may be     \naffected by a variety of factors, including   \nits cash flow, the size of its reserves, its  \naccess to foreign exchange, the relative size \nof its debt service burden to its economy as a\nwhole, and political constraints. A           \ngovernmental entity may default on its        \nobligations or may require renegotiation or   \nreschedule of debt payments. Any restructuring\nof a sovereign debt obligation held by the    \nFund will likely have a significant adverse   \neffect on the value of the obligation. In the \nevent of default of sovereign debt, the Fund  \nmay be unable to pursue legal action against  \nthe sovereign issuer or to realize on         \ncollateral securing the debt. The sovereign   \ndebt of many non-U.S. governments, including  \ntheir sub-divisions and instrumentalities, is \nrated below investment-grade. Sovereign debt  \nrisk may be greater for debt securities issued\nor guaranteed by emerging and/or frontier     \ncountries.                                    \n                                              \nTax Exemption Risk. There is no guarantee that\nany of the Fund's income will be exempt from  \nfederal or state income taxes. Events         \noccurring after the date of issuance of a     \nmunicipal bond or after the Fund's acquisition\nof a municipal bond may result in a           \ndetermination that interest on that bond is   \nincludible in gross income for federal income \ntax purposes retroactively to its date of     \nissuance. Such a determination may cause a    \nportion of prior distributions by the Fund to \nits shareholders that is attributable to      \nmunicipal bonds to be taxable to those        \nshareholders in the year of receipt. Federal  \nor state changes in income or alternative     \nminimum tax rates or in the tax treatment of  \nmunicipal bonds may make municipal bonds less \nattractive as investments and cause them to   \ndecline in value.                             \n                                              \nTechnology Sector Risk . Market or economic   \nfactors impacting technology companies and    \ncompanies that rely heavily on technological  \nadvances could have a major effect on the     \nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of \nstocks of technology companies and companies  \nthat rely heavily on technology is            \nparticularly vulnerable to rapid changes in   \ntechnology product cycles, rapid product      \nobsolescence, government regulation and       \ncompetition, both domestically and            \ninternationally, including competition from   \nforeign competitors with lower production     \ncosts. Technology companies may have limited  \nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Stocks of technology companies and \ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,    \nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned    \ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the  \noverall market. Technology companies are      \nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual  \nproperty rights, the loss or impairment of    \nwhich may adversely affect profitability.     \nAdditionally, companies in the technology     \nsector may face dramatic and often            \nunpredictable changes in growth rates and     \ncompetition for the services of qualified     \npersonnel.                                    \n                                              \nUnconstrained Sector Risk . The Fund may      \ninvest a substantial portion of its assets    \nwithin one or more economic sectors or        \nindustries, which may change from time to     \ntime. When the Fund focuses its investments in\na particular industry or sector, financial,   \neconomic, business, and other developments    \naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on \nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector, \nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\n                                              \nU.S. Government Securities Risk . U.S.        \ngovernment securities, such as Treasury bills,\nnotes and bonds and mortgage-backed securities\nguaranteed by the Government National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d), are supported by  \nthe full faith and credit of the United       \nStates; others are supported by the right of  \nthe issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury;  \nothers are supported by the discretionary     \nauthority of the U.S. government to purchase  \nthe agency's obligations; and still others are\nsupported only by the credit of the issuing   \nagency, instrumentality, or enterprise.       \nAlthough U.S. government-sponsored enterprises\nsuch as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage        \nCorporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) and the Federal   \nNational Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d)  \nmay be chartered or sponsored by Congress,    \n                      35                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nthey are not funded by Congressional          \nappropriations, and their securities are not  \nissued by the U.S. Treasury nor supported by  \nthe full faith and credit of the U.S.         \ngovernment. There is no assurance that the    \nU.S. government would provide financial       \nsupport to its agencies and instrumentalities \nif not required to do so. In addition, certain\ngovernmental entities have been subject to    \nregulatory scrutiny regarding their accounting\npolicies and practices and other concerns that\nmay result in legislation, changes in         \nregulatory oversight and/or other consequences\nthat could adversely affect the credit        \nquality, availability, or investment character\nof securities issued by these entities. The   \nvalue and liquidity of U.S. government        \nsecurities may be affected adversely by       \nchanges in the ratings of those securities.   \nSecurities issued by the U.S. Treasury        \nhistorically have been considered to present  \nminimal credit risk. The downgrade in the     \nlong-term U.S. credit rating by at least one  \nmajor rating agency has introduced greater    \nuncertainty about the ability of the U.S. to  \nrepay its obligations. A further credit rating\ndowngrade or a U.S. credit default could      \ndecrease the value and increase the volatility\nof the Fund's investments.                    \n                                              \nU.S. Treasury Obligations Risk . U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other fixed income\nsecurities in their interest rates,           \nmaturities, times of issuance and other       \ncharacteristics. Similar to other issuers,    \nchanges to the financial condition or credit  \nrating of the U.S. government may cause the   \nvalue of the Fund\u2018s U.S. Treasury obligations \nto decline. The total public debt of the      \nUnited States as a percentage of gross        \ndomestic product has grown rapidly since the  \nbeginning of the recent financial downturn.   \nAlthough high debt levels do not necessarily  \nindicate or cause economic problems, they may \ncreate certain systemic risks if sound debt   \nmanagement practices are not implemented. A   \nhigh national debt level may increase market  \npressures to meet government funding needs,   \nwhich may drive debt cost higher and cause a  \ncountry to sell additional debt, thereby      \nincreasing refinancing risk. A high national  \ndebt also raises concerns that a government   \nwill not be able to make principal or interest\npayments when they are due. In the worst case,\nunsustainable debt levels can cause a decline \nin the value of the dollar (which may lead to \ninflation), and can prevent the U.S.          \ngovernment from implementing effective        \ncounter-cyclical fiscal policy in economic    \ndownturns. U.S. Treasury securities are       \ncurrently given the top rating by all major   \nratings agencies except Standard & Poor's     \nRatings Services, which rates them AA+, one   \ngrade below their top rating. Since           \ndowngrading U.S. Treasury securities from AAA \nto AA+ in 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings     \nServices has affirmed its rating. A downgrade \nof the ratings of U.S. government debt        \nobligations, such as U.S. Treasury            \nobligations, which are often used as a        \nbenchmark for other borrowing arrangements,   \ncould result in higher interest rates for     \nindividual and corporate borrowers, cause     \ndisruptions in the international bond markets \nand have a substantial negative effect on the \nU.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury    \nsecurities from another ratings agency or a   \nfurther downgrade below AA+ rating by Standard\n& Poor's Ratings Services may cause the value \nof the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to    \ndecline.                                      \n                                              \nUtilities Sector Risk. Utility companies are  \naffected by supply and demand, operating      \ncosts, government regulation, environmental   \nfactors, liabilities for environmental damage \nand general civil liabilities, and rate caps  \nor rate changes. Although rate changes of a   \nutility usually fluctuate in approximate      \ncorrelation with financing costs, due to      \npolitical and regulatory factors, rate changes\nordinarily occur only following a delay after \nthe changes in financing costs. This factor   \nwill tend to favorably affect a regulated     \nutility company's earnings and dividends in   \ntimes of decreasing costs, but conversely,    \nwill tend to adversely affect earnings and    \ndividends when costs are rising. The value of \nregulated utility debt securities (and, to a  \nlesser extent, equity securities) may tend to \nhave an inverse relationship to the movement  \nof interest rates. Certain utility companies  \nhave experienced full or partial deregulation \nin recent years. These utility companies are  \nfrequently more similar to industrial         \ncompanies in that they are subject to greater \ncompetition and have been permitted by        \nregulators to diversify outside of their      \noriginal geographic regions and their         \ntraditional lines of business. These          \nopportunities may permit certain utility      \ncompanies to earn more than their traditional \nregulated rates of return. Some companies,    \nhowever, may be forced to defend their core   \nbusiness and may be less profitable. In       \naddition, natural disasters, terrorist        \nattacks, government intervention or other     \nfactors may render a utility company's        \nequipment unusable or obsolete and negatively \nimpact profitability.                         \n                                              \nAmong the risks that may affect utility       \ncompanies are the following: risks of         \nincreases in fuel and other operating costs;  \nthe high cost of borrowing to finance capital \nconstruction during inflationary periods;     \nrestrictions on operations and increased costs\nand delays associated with compliance with    \nenvironmental and nuclear safety regulations; \nand the difficulties involved in obtaining    \nnatural gas for resale or fuel for generating \nelectricity at reasonable prices. Other risks \ninclude those related to the construction and \noperation of nuclear power plants, the effects\nof energy conservation and the effects of     \nregulatory changes.                           \n                      36                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nValuation Risk . Some portfolio holdings,     \npotentially a large portion of the Fund's     \ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the    \nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market  \nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are       \nmultiple methods that can be used to value a  \nportfolio holding when market quotations are  \nnot readily available. The value established  \nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time  \nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been     \npriced using market quotations. Portfolio     \nholdings that are valued using techniques     \nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair \nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater \nfluctuation in their valuations from one day  \nto the next than if market quotations were    \nused. Technological issues or other service   \ndisruption issues involving third-party       \nservice providers may cause the Fund to value \nits investments incorrectly. In addition,     \nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the     \nvalue established for it at any time, and it  \nis possible that the Fund would incur a loss  \nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby the Fund at that time.                     \n                                              \nVariable and Floating Rate Securities Risk .  \nVariable or floating rate securities are debt \nsecurities with variable or floating interest \nrates payments. Variable or floating rate     \nsecurities bear rates of interest that are    \nadjusted periodically according to formulae   \nintended generally to reflect market rates of \ninterest and allow the Fund to participate    \n(determined in accordance with the terms of   \nthe securities) in increases in interest rates\nthrough upward adjustments of the coupon rates\non the securities. However, during periods of \nincreasing interest rates, changes in the     \ncoupon rates may lag behind the changes in    \nmarket rates or may have limits on the maximum\nincreases in coupon rates. Alternatively,     \nduring periods of declining interest rates,   \nthe coupon rates on such securities will      \ntypically readjust downward resulting in a    \nlower yield. The Fund may also invest in      \nvariable or floating rate equity securities,  \nwhose dividend payments vary based on changes \nin market rates of interest or other factors. \n                                              \nIn addition, investment in derivative variable\nrate securities, such as inverse floaters,    \nwhose rates vary inversely with market rates  \nof interest, or range floaters or capped      \nfloaters, whose rates are subject to periodic \nor lifetime caps, or in securities that pay a \nrate of interest determined by applying a     \nmultiple to the variable rate involves special\nrisks as compared to investment in a fixed-   \nrate security and may involve leverage. The   \nextent of increases and decreases in the      \nvalues of derivative variable rate securities \nand the corresponding change to the net asset \nvalue of the Fund in response to changes in   \nmarket rates of interest generally may be     \nlarger than comparable changes in the value of\nan equal principal amount of a fixed-rate     \nsecurity having similar credit quality,       \nredemption provisions, and maturity. The      \nmarkets for such securities may be less       \ndeveloped and may have less liquidity than the\nmarkets for conventional securities.          \n                                              \nWhen-Issued, TBA and Delayed Delivery         \nSecurities Risk. The Fund may purchase        \nsecurities on a when-issued, TBA or delayed   \ndelivery basis and may purchase securities on \na forward commitment basis. The purchase price\nof the securities is typically fixed at the   \ntime of the commitment, but delivery and      \npayment can take place a month or more after  \nthe date of the commitment. The prices of the \nsecurities so purchased or sold are subject to\nmarket fluctuations. At the time of delivery  \nof the securities, the value may be more or   \nless than the purchase or sale price. Purchase\nof securities on a when-issued, TBA, delayed  \ndelivery, or forward commitment basis may give\nrise to investment leverage, and may result in\nincreased volatility of the Fund's net asset  \nvalue. Default by, or bankruptcy of, a        \ncounterparty to a when-issued, TBA or delayed \ndelivery transaction would expose the Fund to \npossible losses because of an adverse market  \naction, expenses or delays in connection with \nthe purchase or sale of the pools specified in\nsuch transaction. Financial Industry          \nRegulatory Authority, Inc. rules impose       \nmandatory margin requirements for certain     \ntypes of when-issued, TBA delayed delivery or \nforward commitment transactions, with limited \nexceptions. Such transactions require         \nmandatory collateralization which may increase\nthe cost of such transactions and impose added\noperational complexity.                       \n                                              \n  Non-Principal Risks                         \n                                              \nAuthorized Participants, Market Makers and    \nLiquidity Providers Concentration Risk. The   \nFund has a limited number of financial        \ninstitutions that may act as Authorized       \nParticipants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are responsible   \nfor the creation and redemption activity for  \nthe Fund. In addition, there may be a limited \nnumber of market makers and/or liquidity      \nproviders in the marketplace. To the extent   \neither of the following events occur, Fund    \nShares may trade at a material discount to NAV\nand possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit the \nbusiness or otherwise become unable to process\ncreation and/or redemption orders and no other\nAPs step forward to perform these services, or\n(ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers \nexit the business or significantly reduce     \ntheir business activities and no other        \nentities step forward to perform their        \nfunctions.                                    \n                      37                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nConcentration Risk. The Fund's assets will    \ngenerally be concentrated in an industry or   \ngroup of industries to the extent that the    \nFund's underlying Index concentrates in a     \nparticular industry or group of industries.   \nWhen the Fund focuses its investments in a    \nparticular industry or sector, financial,     \neconomic, business, and other developments    \naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on \nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector, \nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\n                                              \nConflicts of Interest Risk . An investment in \nthe Fund may be subject to a number of actual \nor potential conflicts of interest. For       \nexample, the Adviser or its affiliates may    \nprovide services to the Fund, such as         \nsecurities lending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting   \nservices, transfer agency and shareholder     \nservicing, securities brokerage services, and \nother services for which the Fund would       \ncompensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates.\nThe Fund may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise     \naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no      \nassurance that the rates at which the Fund    \npays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its   \naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters   \ninto transactions with the Adviser or its     \naffiliates will be the most favorable         \navailable in the market generally or as       \nfavorable as the rates the Adviser makes      \navailable to other clients. Because of its    \nfinancial interest, the Adviser may have an   \nincentive to enter into transactions or       \narrangements on behalf of the Fund with itself\nor its affiliates in circumstances where it   \nmight not have done so in the absence of that \ninterest, provided that the Adviser will      \ncomply with applicable regulatory             \nrequirements.                                 \n                                              \nThe Adviser and its affiliates serve as       \ninvestment adviser to other clients and may   \nmake investment decisions that may be         \ndifferent from those that will be made by the \nAdviser on behalf of the Fund. For example,   \nthe Adviser may provide asset allocation      \nadvice to some clients that may include a     \nrecommendation to invest in or redeem from    \nparticular issuers while not providing that   \nsame recommendation to all clients invested in\nthe same or similar issuers. The Adviser may  \n(subject to applicable law) be simultaneously \nseeking to purchase (or sell) investments for \nthe Fund and to sell (or purchase) the same   \ninvestment for accounts, funds, or structured \nproducts for which it serves as asset manager,\nor for other clients or affiliates. The       \nAdviser and its affiliates may invest for     \nclients in various securities that are senior,\npari passu or junior to, or have interests    \ndifferent from or adverse to, the securities  \nthat are owned by the Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other      \nbusiness activities, may acquire material non-\npublic confidential information that may      \nrestrict the Adviser from purchasing          \nsecurities or selling securities for itself or\nits clients (including the Fund) or otherwise \nusing such information for the benefit of its \nclients or itself.                            \n                                              \n The foregoing does not purport to be a       \ncomprehensive list or complete explanation of \nall potential conflicts of interests which may\naffect the Fund. The Fund may encounter       \ncircumstances, or enter into transactions, in \nwhich conflicts of interest that are not      \nlisted or discussed above may arise.          \n                                              \nCosts of Buying and Selling Shares . Investors\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket will pay brokerage commissions or other\ncharges imposed by brokers, as determined by  \nthat broker. Brokerage commissions are often a\nfixed amount and may be a significant         \nproportional cost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell relatively small amounts of Fund      \nShares. In addition, secondary market         \ninvestors will also incur the cost of the     \ndifference between the price that an investor \nis willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d  \nprice) and the price at which an investor is  \nwilling to sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price).\nThis difference in bid and ask prices is often\nreferred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask       \nspread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time  \nfor Fund Shares based on trading volume and   \nmarket liquidity, and is generally lower if   \nFund Shares have more trading volume and      \nmarket liquidity and higher if Fund Shares    \nhave little trading volume and market         \nliquidity. Further, increased market          \nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask        \nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,       \nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may           \nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making \nsmall investments.                            \n                                              \nCybersecurity Risk . With the increased use of\ntechnologies such as the Internet and the     \ndependence on computer systems to perform     \nbusiness and operational functions, funds     \n(such as the Fund) and their service providers\n(including the Adviser) may be prone to       \noperational and information security risks    \nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or           \ntechnological malfunctions. In general, cyber-\nattacks are deliberate, but unintentional     \nevents may have similar effects. Cyber-attacks\ninclude, among others, stealing or corrupting \ndata maintained online or digitally,          \npreventing legitimate users from accessing    \ninformation or services on a website,         \nreleasing confidential information without    \nauthorization, and causing operational        \ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against, \nor security breakdowns of, the Fund, the      \nAdviser, a sub-adviser or a custodian,        \ntransfer agent, or other affiliated or third- \nparty service provider may adversely affect   \nthe Fund or its shareholders. For instance,   \ncyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may   \ninterfere with the processing of              \n                      38                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nshareholder or other transactions, affect the \nFund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the\nrelease of private shareholder information or \nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject the    \nFund to regulatory fines, penalties or        \nfinancial losses, reimbursement or other      \ncompensation costs, and additional compliance \ncosts. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions\nmay render records of Fund assets and         \ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund   \nShares, and other data integral to the        \nfunctioning of the Fund inaccessible or       \ninaccurate or incomplete. The Fund may also   \nincur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents\nin the future. The Fund and its shareholders  \ncould be negatively impacted as a result.     \nWhile the Adviser has established business    \ncontinuity plans and systems designed to      \nminimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the\nuse of technology, processes and controls,    \nthere are inherent limitations in such plans  \nand systems, including the possibility that   \ncertain risks have not been identified, given \nthe evolving nature of this threat. The Fund  \nrelies on third-party service providers for   \nmany of its day-to-day operations, and will be\nsubject to the risk that the protections and  \nprotocols implemented by those service        \nproviders will be ineffective to protect the  \nFund from cyber-attack. The Adviser does not  \ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems   \nput in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may    \nhave limited indemnification obligations to   \nthe Adviser or the Fund. Similar types of     \ncybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions \nalso are present for issuers of securities in \nwhich the Fund invests, which could result in \nmaterial adverse consequences for such        \nissuers, and may cause the Fund's investment  \nin such securities to lose value.             \n                                              \nIndex Construction Risk . A security included \nin the Index may not exhibit the              \ncharacteristic or provide the specific        \nexposure for which it was selected and        \nconsequently the Fund's holdings may not      \nexhibit returns consistent with that          \ncharacteristic or exposure.                   \n                                              \nIndex Licensing Risk . It is possible that the\nlicense under which the Adviser or the Fund is\npermitted to replicate or otherwise use the   \nIndex will be terminated or may be disputed,  \nimpaired or cease to remain in effect. In such\na case, the Adviser may be required to replace\nthe Index with another index which it         \nconsiders to be appropriate in light of the   \ninvestment strategy of the Fund. The use of   \nany such substitute index may have an adverse \nimpact on the Fund's performance. In the event\nthat the Adviser is unable to identify a      \nsuitable replacement for the Index, it may    \ndetermine to terminate the Fund.              \n                                              \nMoney Market Risk . An investment in a money  \nmarket fund is not a deposit of any bank and  \nis not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or   \nany other government agency. Certain money    \nmarket funds seek to preserve the value of    \ntheir shares at $1.00 per share, although     \nthere can be no assurance that they will do   \nso, and it is possible to lose money by       \ninvesting in such a money market fund. A major\nor unexpected change in interest rates or a   \ndecline in the credit quality of an issuer or \nentity providing credit support, an inactive  \ntrading market for money market instruments,  \nor adverse market, economic, industry,        \npolitical, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause the share price of such\na money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will   \nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at \ntimes when the fair value of the money market \nfund's portfolio per share is more or less    \nthan $1.00. None of State Street Corporation, \nState Street, State Street Global Advisors    \n(\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (\u201cState \nStreet Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an   \ninvestment in a money market fund at $1.00 per\nshare. Investors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from   \nState Street Entities. Other money market     \nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV  \nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the \nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or \nless than their original purchase price.      \nRecent changes in the regulation of money     \nmarket funds may affect the operations and    \nstructures of money market funds. A money     \nmarket fund may be permitted or required to   \nimpose redemption fees or to impose           \nlimitations on redemptions during periods of  \nhigh illiquidity in the markets for the       \ninvestments held by it.                       \n                                              \nPortfolio Turnover Risk . The Fund may engage \nin frequent trading of its portfolio          \nsecurities. Fund turnover generally involves a\nnumber of direct and indirect costs and       \nexpenses to the Fund, including, for example, \nbrokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and    \nbid/asked spreads, and transaction costs on   \nthe sale of securities and reinvestment in    \nother securities. The costs related to        \nincreased portfolio turnover have the effect  \nof reducing the Fund's investment return, and \nthe sale of securities by the Fund may result \nin the realization of taxable capital gains,  \nincluding short-term capital gains. The Fund  \nmay engage in frequent trading of its         \nportfolio securities in connection with Index \nrebalancing. Frequent trading may cause the   \nFund to incur additional transaction costs and\nexperience different tax consequences in      \ncomparison to an ETF that does not engage in  \nfrequent trading.                             \n                      39                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend    \nportfolio securities in an amount not to      \nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the  \nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any \ntime. Any such loans must be continuously     \nsecured by collateral maintained on a current \nbasis in an amount at least equal to the      \nmarket value of the securities loaned by the  \nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a \nloan transaction, as compensation for lending \nits securities, the Fund will receive a       \nportion of the dividends or interest accrued  \non the securities held as collateral or, in   \nthe case of cash collateral, a portion of the \nincome from the investment of such cash. In   \naddition, the Fund will receive the amount of \nall dividends, interest and other             \ndistributions on the loaned securities.       \nHowever, the borrower has the right to vote   \nthe loaned securities. The Fund will call     \nloans to vote proxies if a material issue     \naffecting the investment is to be voted upon. \nEfforts to recall such securities promptly may\nbe unsuccessful, especially for foreign       \nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and   \nmay involve expenses to the Fund. Securities  \nlending involves the risk that the Fund may   \nlose money because the borrower of the loaned \nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. Should the borrower  \nof the securities fail financially, the Fund  \nmay experience delays in recovering the       \nsecurities or exercising its rights in the    \ncollateral. Loans are made only to borrowers  \nthat are deemed by the securities lending     \nagent to be of good financial standing. In a  \nloan transaction, the Fund will also bear the \nrisk of any decline in value of securities    \nprovided as collateral or acquired with cash  \ncollateral. The Fund will attempt to minimize \nthis risk by limiting the investment of cash  \ncollateral to high quality instruments of     \nshort maturity either directly on behalf of   \nthe lending Fund or through one or more joint \naccounts or funds, which may include those    \nmanaged by the Adviser. To the extent the     \ncollateral provided or investments made with  \ncash collateral differ from securities        \nincluded in an Index, such collateral or      \ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss   \nthan the securities included in the Index. In \naddition, the Fund will be subject to the risk\nthat any income generated by lending its      \nsecurities or reinvesting cash collateral is  \nlower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay\na borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute  \npayments for dividends when overseeing the    \nFund's securities lending activity.           \n                                              \nTrading Issues . Although Fund Shares are     \nlisted for trading on the Exchange and may be \nlisted or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock   \nexchanges other than the Exchange, there can  \nbe no assurance that an active trading market \nfor the Fund Shares will develop or be        \nmaintained. Trading in Fund Shares on the     \nExchange may be halted due to market          \nconditions or for reasons that, in the view of\nthe Exchange, make trading in Fund Shares     \ninadvisable. In addition, trading in Fund     \nShares on the Exchange is subject to trading  \nhalts caused by extraordinary market          \nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit      \nbreaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of      \noperating companies listed on a stock         \nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and   \nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's \nshares. While the Fund expects that the       \nability of Authorized Participants to create  \nand redeem Fund Shares at net asset value     \nshould be effective in reducing any such      \nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such \nshort sales. There can be no assurance that   \nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to \nmaintain the listing of the Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that    \nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at \nall, on any stock exchange.                   \n                                              \n   Management                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Investment Adviser                          \n                                              \nSSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to   \nthe Fund and, subject to the supervision of   \nthe Board, is responsible for the investment  \nmanagement of the Fund. The Adviser provides  \nan investment management program for the Fund \nand manages the investment of the Fund's      \nassets. The Adviser is a wholly-owned         \nsubsidiary of State Street Global Advisors,   \nInc., which is itself a wholly-owned          \nsubsidiary of State Street Corporation. The   \nAdviser is registered with the SEC under the  \nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.  \nThe Adviser and certain other affiliates of   \nState Street Corporation make up SSGA.

Additional\nPurchase and Sale Information Fund Shares are\nlisted for secondary trading on the Exchange\nand individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The\nExchange may close early on the business day\nbefore certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules\nare subject to change without notice. If you\nbuy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you will pay the secondary market\nprice for Fund Shares. In addition, you may\nincur customary brokerage commissions and\ncharges and may pay some or all of the spread\nbetween the bid and the offered price in the\nsecondary market on each leg of a round trip\n(purchase and sale) transaction. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares will fluctuate\ncontinuously throughout trading hours based on\nmarket supply and demand rather than the\nFund's net asset value, which is calculated at\nthe end of each business day. Fund Shares will\ntrade on the Exchange at prices that may be\nabove ( i.e., at a premium) or below ( i.e.,\nat a discount), to varying 43 Table of\nContents degrees, the daily net asset value of\nFund Shares. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nmay deviate significantly from the Fund's net\nasset value during periods of market\nvolatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares\ncan be issued and redeemed daily in Creation\nUnits, the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts and premiums to net asset value\nshould not be sustained over long periods. The\nExchange will disseminate, every fifteen\nseconds during the regular trading day, an\nindicative optimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d)\nrelating to the Fund. The IOPV calculations\nare estimates of the value of the Fund's net\nasset value per Fund Share. Premiums and\ndiscounts between the IOPV and the market\nprice may occur. This should not be viewed as\na \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset value\nper Fund Share. The IOPV is based on the\ncurrent market value of the published basket\nof portfolio securities and/or cash required\nto be deposited in exchange for a Creation\nUnit and does not necessarily reflect the\nprecise composition of the Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. The IOPV price is\nbased on quotes and closing prices from the\nsecurities' local market converted into U.S.\ndollars at the current currency rates and may\nnot reflect events that occur subsequent to\nthe local market's close. Therefore, the IOPV\nmay not reflect the best possible valuation of\nthe Fund's current portfolio. Neither the Fund\nnor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are\ninvolved in, or responsible for, the\ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and\nmake no warranty as to their accuracy. The\nFund does not impose any restrictions on the\nfrequency of purchases and redemptions;\nhowever, the Fund reserves the right to reject\nor limit purchases at any time as described in\nthe SAI. When considering that no restriction\nor policy was necessary, the Board evaluated\nthe risks posed by market timing activities,\nsuch as whether frequent purchases and\nredemptions would interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of the Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause the Fund\nto experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional\nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and\nredeemed only in large quantities of shares\nknown as Creation Units, available only from\nthe Fund directly, and that most trading in\nthe Fund occurs on the Exchange at prevailing\nmarket prices and does not involve the Fund\ndirectly. Given this structure, the Board\ndetermined that it is unlikely that (a) market\ntiming would be attempted by the Fund's\nshareholders or (b) any attempts to market\ntime the Fund by shareholders would result in\nnegative impact to the Fund or its\nshareholders. Distributions Dividends and\nCapital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are\nentitled to your share of the Fund's income\nand net realized gains on its investments. The\nFund pays out substantially all of its net\nearnings to its shareholders as\n\u201cdistributions.\u201d The Fund may (through direct\ninvestments or through investments indirectly\nheld through SPDR ETFs) earn dividends\ninterest from debt securities and, if\nparticipating, securities lending income. The\nFund will generally realize short-term capital\ngains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges\nassets held for one year or less. Net short-\nterm capital gains will generally be treated\nas ordinary income when distributed to\nshareholders. The Fund will generally realize\nlong-term capital gains or losses whenever it\nsells or exchanges assets held for more than\none year. Net capital gains (the excess of the\nFund's net long-term capital gains over its\nnet short-term capital losses) are distributed\nto shareholders as \u201ccapital gain\ndistributions.\u201d Income dividend distributions,\nif any, are generally distributed to\nshareholders monthly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Net\ncapital gains for the Fund are distributed at\nleast annually. Dividends may be declared and\npaid more frequently or at any other time to\nimprove Index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nDistributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares\nonly if the broker through whom you purchased\nFund Shares makes such option available.\nDistributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as\nif such distributions had not been reinvested.\n44 Table of Contents Portfolio Holdings\nDisclosure The Fund's portfolio holdings\ndisclosure policy is described in the SAI. In\naddition, the identities and quantities of the\nsecurities held by the Fund are disclosed on\nthe Fund's website. Additional Tax Information\nThe following discussion is a summary of some\nimportant U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in the Fund. Your investment in the\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes on Distributions.\nIn general, your taxable distributions are\nsubject to federal income tax when they are\npaid, whether you take them in cash or\nreinvest them in the Fund. The taxable income\ndividends and short-term capital gains\ndistributions you receive from the Fund will\nbe taxed as either ordinary income or\nqualified dividend income. Subject to certain\nlimitations, dividends that are reported by\nthe Fund as qualified dividend income are\ntaxable to noncorporate shareholders at rates\nof up to 20%. Any distributions of the Fund's\nnet capital gains are taxable as long-term\ncapital gain regardless of how long you have\nowned Fund Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders\nat rates of up to 20%. Dividends that are\nreported as exempt-interest dividends will not\nbe subject to regular federal income tax.\nDistributions in excess of the Fund's current\nand accumulated earnings and profits are\ntreated as a tax-free return of capital to the\nextent of your basis in Fund Shares, and, in\ngeneral, as capital gain thereafter. In\ngeneral, dividends may be reported by the Fund\nas qualified dividend income if they are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by the Fund, which, in general,\nincludes the Fund's share of dividend income a\nSPDR ETF receives from taxable U.S.\ncorporations and certain foreign corporations\n( i.e., certain foreign corporations\nincorporated in a possession of the United\nStates or in certain countries with a\ncomprehensive tax treaty with the United\nStates, and certain other foreign corporations\nif the stock with respect to which the\ndividend is paid is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the United\nStates), provided that the SPDR ETF satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements in respect\nof the stock of such corporations and has not\nhedged its position in the stock in certain\nways. A dividend generally will not be treated\nas qualified dividend income if the dividend\nis received with respect to any share of stock\nheld by the SPDR ETF for fewer than 61 days\nduring the 121-day period beginning at the\ndate which is 60 days before the date on which\nsuch share becomes ex-dividend with respect to\nsuch dividend or, in the case of certain\npreferred stock, for fewer than 91 days during\nthe 181-day period beginning 90 days before\nsuch date. These holding period requirements\nwill also apply to your ownership of Fund\nShares. Holding periods may be suspended for\nthese purposes for stock that is hedged.\nAdditionally, dividends paid on fund shares on\nloan will not be treated as qualified dividend\nincome. Because a SPDR ETF may invest in\n\u201cprivate activity bonds,\u201d the interest on\nwhich is not federally tax-exempt to persons\nwho are \u201csubstantial users\u201d of the facilities\nfinanced by such bonds or \u201crelated persons\u201d of\nsuch \u201csubstantial users,\u201d the Fund may not be\nan appropriate investment for shareholders who\nare considered either \u201csubstantial users\u201d or\n\u201crelated persons\u201d within the meaning of the\nCode. In addition, interest on certain\nmunicipal securities that meet the definition\nof private activity bonds under the Code is\nincluded as an item of tax preference in\ndetermining the amount of a taxpayer's\nalternative minimum taxable income. To the\nextent a SPDR ETF receives income from private\nactivity bonds, a portion of any exempt-\ninterest dividend attributable to that income,\nalthough otherwise exempt from federal income\ntax, will be taxable to those shareholders\nsubject to the alternative minimum tax regime.\nThe Fund will annually supply shareholders\nwith a report indicating the percentage of its\nincome attributable to municipal securities\nrequired to be included in calculating the\nfederal alternative minimum tax. Exempt-\ninterest dividends from the Fund are taken\ninto account in determining the taxable\nportion of any Social Security or rail road\nretirement benefits that you receive. If you\nreceive Social Security or railroad benefits,\nyou should consult your tax advisor about how\nan investment in the Fund may affect the\ntaxation of your benefits. Exempt-interest\ndividends attributable to interest on\nmunicipal securities issued by a state or its\npolitical subdivisions may be exempt in the\nhands of a shareholder from income tax imposed\nby that state, but exempt-interest dividends\nattributable to interest on municipal\nsecurities issued by another state generally\nwill not be exempt from such income tax. 45\nTable of Contents U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding specified thresholds are subject to\na 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on all or a\nportion of their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d\nwhich includes taxable interest, dividends\n(other than exempt-interest dividends) and\ncertain capital gains (generally including\ncapital gain distributions and capital gains\nrealized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This\n3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of\nthe undistributed net investment income of\ncertain shareholders that are estates and\ntrusts. Certain tax-exempt educational\ninstitutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on\nnet investment income. For these purposes,\ncertain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. If you lend your Fund\nShares pursuant to securities lending\narrangements you may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares are\nheld by the borrower) as qualified dividend\nincome. You should consult your financial\nintermediary or tax advisor to discuss your\nparticular circumstances. Distributions paid\nin January, but declared by the Fund in\nOctober, November or December of the previous\nyear, payable to shareholders of record in\nsuch a month, may be taxable to you in the\ncalendar year in which they were declared. The\nFund will inform you of the amount of your\nordinary income dividends, qualified dividend\nincome and capital gain distributions shortly\nafter the close of each calendar year. A\ndistribution will reduce the Fund's net asset\nvalue per Fund Share and may be taxable to you\nas ordinary income or capital gain even\nthough, from an investment standpoint, the\ndistribution may constitute a return of\ncapital. Original Issue Discount . Investments\nby a SPDR ETF in zero coupon or other discount\nsecurities will result in income to the SPDR\nETF equal to a portion of the excess face\nvalue of the securities over their issue price\n(the \u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or \u201cOID\u201d) each\nyear that the securities are held, even though\nthe SPDR ETF may receive no cash interest\npayments or may receive cash interest payments\nthat are less than the income recognized for\ntax purposes. In other circumstances, whether\npursuant to the terms of a security or as a\nresult of other factors outside the control of\na SPDR ETF, the SPDR ETF may recognize income\nwithout receiving a commensurate amount of\ncash. The SPDR ETF\u2018s share of such income is\nincluded in determining the amount that the\nSPDR ETF must distribute to maintain its\neligibility for treatment as a regulated\ninvestment company and to avoid the payment of\nfederal tax, including the nondeductible 4%\nexcise tax. Because any income required to be\nrecognized as a result of the OID and/or\nmarket discount rules (discussed below) may\nnot be matched by a corresponding cash\npayment, the SPDR ETF may be required to\nborrow money or dispose of securities to be\nable to make distributions to its shareholders\nin order to qualify for treatment as a\nregulated investment company and eliminate\ntaxes at the SPDR ETF level. Inflation-Indexed\nBonds. Special rules apply to any investments\nby a SPDR ETF in inflation-indexed bonds.\nGenerally, all stated interest on such bonds\nis recorded as income by the SPDR ETF under\nits regular method of accounting for interest\nincome. The amount of any positive inflation\nadjustment for a taxable year, which results\nfrom an increase in the inflation-adjusted\nprincipal amount of the bond, is treated as\nOID. The amount of the SPDR ETF's OID in a\ntaxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease the SPDR ETF's taxable income for\nsuch year without a corresponding receipt of\ncash until the bond matures. As a result, the\nSPDR ETF may need to use other sources of cash\nto satisfy its distribution requirements for\nsuch year. The amount of any negative\ninflation adjustments, which result from a\ndecrease in the inflation-adjusted principal\namount of the bond, first reduces the amount\nof interest (including stated interest, OID,\nand market discount, if any) otherwise\nincludible in the SPDR ETF's income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year; any\nremaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain\ncircumstances, carried forward to reduce the\namount of interest income taken into account\nwith respect to the bond in future taxable\nyears. Market Discount. Any market discount\nrecognized on a market discount bond is\ntaxable as ordinary income. A market discount\nbond is a bond acquired in the secondary\nmarket at a price below redemption value or\nbelow adjusted issue price if the bond was\nissued with original issue discount. Absent an\nelection by a SPDR ETF to include the market\ndiscount in income as it accrues, gain on the\nSPDR ETF's disposition of such an obligation\nwill be treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued\nmarket discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the market\ndiscount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash payment, a SPDR ETF may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand eliminate taxes at the SPDR ETF level,\npotentially resulting in additional taxable\ngain or loss to a SPDR ETF. 46 Table of\nContents Market Discount (Municipal\nSecurities). If a SPDR ETF purchases a\nmunicipal security at a market discount, any\ngain realized by the SPDR ETF upon sale or\nredemption of the municipal security will be\ntreated as taxable interest income to the\nextent of the market discount, and any gain\nrealized in excess of the market discount will\nbe treated as capital gains. Derivatives and\nOther Complex Securities. The SPDR ETFs may\ninvest in complex securities. These\ninvestments may be subject to numerous special\nand complex rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by the\nSPDR ETFs are treated as ordinary income or\ncapital gain, accelerate the recognition of\nincome to the SPDR ETFs and/or defer the SPDR\nETFs' ability to recognize losses. In turn,\nthese rules may affect the amount, timing or\ncharacter of the income distributed to you by\nthe Fund. You should consult your personal tax\nadvisor regarding the application of these\nrules. Foreign Currency Transactions. The SPDR\nETF's transactions in foreign currencies,\nforeign currency denominated debt obligations\nand certain foreign currency options, futures\ncontracts and forward contracts (and similar\ninstruments) may give rise to ordinary income\nor loss to the extent such income or loss\nresults from fluctuations in the value of the\nforeign currency concerned. Foreign Income\nTaxes. Investment income received by a SPDR\nETF from sources within foreign countries may\nbe subject to foreign income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The United States has entered into\ntax treaties with many foreign countries which\nmay entitle a SPDR ETF to a reduced rate of\nsuch taxes or exemption from taxes on such\nincome. It is impossible to determine the\neffective rate of foreign tax for the Fund in\nadvance since the amount of the assets to be\ninvested within various countries is not\nknown. The Fund may elect to \u201cpass through\u201d to\nyou certain foreign income taxes (including\nwithholding taxes) paid by the SPDR ETF in\nwhich it invests. If the Fund makes such an\nelection, you will be considered to have\nreceived as an additional dividend your share\nof such foreign taxes, but you may be entitled\nto either a corresponding tax deduction in\ncalculating your taxable income, or, subject\nto certain limitations, a credit in\ncalculating your federal income tax. No\ndeduction for such taxes will be permitted to\nindividuals in computing their alternative\nminimum tax liability. If the Fund does not so\nelect, the Fund may be entitled to claim a\ndeduction for certain foreign taxes incurred\nby the SPDR ETFs. Under certain circumstances,\nif the Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes\npaid in respect of a prior year, the value of\nFund Shares could be affected or any foreign\ntax credits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign\ntaxes for the current year could be reduced.\nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund Shares is generally treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for more than one year and as short-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for one year or less, except that any\ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held\nfor six months or less will be disallowed to\nthe extent of exempt-interest dividends\nreceived with respect to those Fund Shares,\nand to the extent not disallowed will be\ntreated as long-term capital loss to the\nextent that capital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to such Fund Shares. Taxes on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units. A\nperson who exchanges securities for Creation\nUnits generally will recognize a gain or loss.\nThe gain or loss will be equal to the\ndifference between the market value of the\nCreation Units at the time and the exchanger's\naggregate basis in the securities surrendered\nplus any cash paid for the Creation Units. A\nperson who exchanges Creation Units for\nsecurities will generally recognize a gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the\nexchanger's basis in the Creation Units and\nthe aggregate market value of the securities\nand the amount of cash received. The IRS,\nhowever, may assert that a loss realized upon\nan exchange of securities for Creation Units\ncannot be deducted currently under the rules\ngoverning \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the basis that\nthere has been no significant change in\neconomic position. Persons exchanging\nsecurities should consult their own tax\nadvisor with respect to whether wash sale\nrules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. Under current federal tax laws,\nany capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Fund Shares (or securities\nsurrendered) have been held for more than one\nyear and as a short-term capital gain or loss\nif the Fund Shares (or securities surrendered)\nhave been held for one year or less. If you\ncreate or redeem Creation Units, you will be\nsent a confirmation statement showing how many\nFund Shares you purchased or sold and at what\nprice. 47 Table of Contents The Trust on\nbehalf of the Fund has the right to reject an\norder for Creation Units if the purchaser (or\na group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining\nthe Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of\nthe outstanding shares of the Fund and if,\npursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the Fund\nwould have a basis in the securities different\nfrom the market value of the securities on the\ndate of deposit. The Trust also has the right\nto require information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser\n(or group of purchasers) will not recognize\ngain or loss upon the exchange of securities\nfor Creation Units. If the Fund redeems\nCreation Units in cash, it may bear additional\ncosts and recognize more capital gains than it\nwould if it redeems Creation Units in-kind.\nNon-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income dividends\npaid by the Fund to shareholders who are non-\nresident aliens or foreign entities will\ngenerally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax (other than distributions reported by the\nFund as interest-related dividends and short-\nterm capital gain dividends), unless a lower\ntreaty rate applies or unless such income is\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, the Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of\nits net income derived from U.S.-source\ninterest and the Fund may report short-term\ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains\non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a trade or business within the\nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax\nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of the\nFund's shares are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment. Unless certain\nnon-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply\nwith IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding\nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions payable to such\nentities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt\nfrom the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement. Backup Withholding. The Fund will\nbe required in certain cases to withhold (as\n\u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts (including\nexempt-interest dividends) payable to any\nshareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the U.S. Other Tax\nIssues. The Fund may be subject to tax in\ncertain states where the Fund does business\n(or is treated as doing business as a result\nof its investments). Furthermore, in those\nstates which have income tax laws, the tax\ntreatment of the Fund and of Fund shareholders\nwith respect to distributions by the Fund may\ndiffer from federal tax treatment. The\nforegoing discussion summarizes some of the\nconsequences under current federal income tax\nlaw of an investment in the Fund. It is not a\nsubstitute for personal tax advice. Consult\nyour personal tax advisor about the potential\ntax consequences of an investment in the Fund\nunder all applicable tax laws. General\nInformation The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nIf shareholders of the Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled\nto one vote for each Fund Share they own.\nAnnual meetings of shareholders will not be\nheld except as required by the 1940 Act and\nother applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization The\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. 48 Table of Contents For\npurposes of the 1940 Act, Fund Shares are\nissued by the respective series of the Trust\nand the acquisition of Fund Shares by\ninvestment companies is subject to the\nrestrictions of Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940\nAct. The Trust has received exemptive relief\nfrom Section 12(d)(1) to allow registered\ninvestment companies to invest in the Fund\nbeyond the limits set forth in Section\n12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions as set forth in an SEC exemptive\norder issued to the Trust, including that such\ninvestment companies enter into an agreement\nwith the Trust. From time to time, the Fund\nmay advertise yield and total return figures.\nYield is a historical measure of dividend\nincome, and total return is a measure of past\ndividend income (assuming that it has been\nreinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither\nyield nor total return should be used to\npredict the future performance of the Fund.\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel\nto the Trust, including the Fund. Ernst &\nYoung LLP serves as the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and will audit the\nFund's financial statements annually.\nFinancial Highlights The financial highlight\ntable is intended to help you understand the\nFund's financial performance since the Fund's\ninception. Certain information reflects the\nperformance results for a single Fund Share.\nThe total returns in the table represent the\nrate that an investor would have earned (or\nlost) on an investment in the Fund (assuming\nreinvestment of all dividends and\ndistributions). This information has been\naudited by Ernst & Young LLP, the Trust's\nindependent registered public accounting firm,\nwhose report, along with the Fund's financial\nhighlights and financial statements, is\nincluded in the annual report to shareholders,\nwhich is available upon request.
