(the         \n     \u201cAdviser\u201d) has contractually agreed to   \n     waive a portion of its management fee    \n     and/or reimburse certain expenses,       \n     until May 11, 2023, so that the net      \n     annual Fund operating expenses, before   \n     application of any fees and expenses     \n     not paid by the Adviser pursuant to the  \n     Investment Advisory Agreement, if any,   \n     will be limited to 0.07% of the Fund's   \n     average daily net assets. The            \n     contractual fee waiver does not provide  \n     for the recoupment by the Adviser of     \n     any fees the Adviser previously waived.  \n     The Adviser may continue the waiver      \n     and/or reimbursement from year to year,  \n     but there is no guarantee that the       \n     Adviser will do so and the waiver        \n     and/or reimbursement may be cancelled    \n     or modified at any time after May 11,    \n     2023.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the\nend of those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. The Example reflects the Fund's\ncontractual fee waiver and/or expense\nreimbursement only in the periods for which\nthe contractual fee waiver and/or expense\nreimbursement is expected to continue.\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions your costs\nwould be:\n                  \n  Year 1  Year 3  \n  $7         $27  \n                  \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. The Fund had not commenced\noperations as of the date of this Prospectus\nand, as a result, does not yet have a\nportfolio turnover rate. The Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In seeking to track the\nperformance of the MarketAxess U.S. Investment\nGrade 400 Corporate Bond Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a sampling strategy, which\nmeans that the Fund is not required to\npurchase all of the\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nBased on its analysis of these factors, SSGA\nFunds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments, such as repurchase agreements and\nmoney market funds (including money market\nfunds advised by the Adviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the extent the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group\nof industries. The Fund may use derivatives,\nincluding credit default swaps and credit\ndefault index swaps, to obtain investment\nexposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the\nIndex, and in managing cash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure the performance of 400\nU.S. dollar denominated investment grade\ncorporate bonds with higher-than-average\nliquidity relative to the broader U.S.\ncorporate bond market. In order to be included\nin the Index, a bond must have a corporate\nbond classification from Refinitiv. Bonds\nincluded in the Index must also, as of the\nIndex Determination Date (defined below), (i)\nbe rated investment grade, (ii) be issued in\nthe U.S. by an issuer that is U.S. or non-U.S.\ndomiciled, (iii) be U.S. dollar denominated,\n(iv) have $300 million or more of par amount\noutstanding, (v) have a remaining maturity of\nat least 2 years, (vi) have an issue date\nprior to the month of the Index Determination\nDate (as defined below), and (vii) have a\nfixed rate (which includes fixed-to-floating\nrate bonds, provided that such bonds are in\ntheir fixed rate term as of the Index\nDetermination Date (as defined below)) or zero\npercent coupon. The Index considers investment\ngrade securities to be rated Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or\nhigher, using the middle rating of Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc.,\nor S&P Global Ratings. If only two of the\nthree agencies rate the security, then the\nmore conservative (lower) rating will be used\nto determine Index eligibility. If only one of\nthe agencies rates the security, then that\nrating will be used. In addition, in order to\nbe included in the Index, bonds must have both\nbid and offer price Composite+ TM(\u201cCP+\u201d)\nvaluations. CP+ is the Index Provider's\n(defined below) proprietary algorithmic\npricing engine. CP+ analyzes industry and\nproprietary trading and liquidity data to\nprovide an indication of the bid price and\noffer price valuations of a bond. If the CP+\npricing algorithm does not have access to\nenough liquidity inputs for a bond, it will\nnot generate bid and offer price valuations\nand the bond will not be eligible for\ninclusion in the Index. Bonds are also\nscreened based on liquidity as measured by\ntheir Relative Liquidity Score (\u201cRLS\u201d). RLS is\nthe Index Provider's proprietary methodology\nthat analyzes industry and proprietary trading\ndata to score a bond's liquidity relative to\nbonds identified by the Index Provider as\nhaving similar risk and return\ncharacteristics. A bond's RLS ranges from 1 to\n10, with 10 being the most liquid, and only\nbonds with an RLS of 7 or higher are eligible\nfor inclusion in the Index. Bonds that remain\neligible for inclusion in the Index after\napplying the screens referred to above are\nthen ranked by par value face amount from\nhighest to lowest. For bonds with the same par\nvalue face amount, ranking is based on the\nfollowing in order of priority: bonds with\nhigher RLS, earlier issue date, and tighter\nCP+ bid/offer spread. After applying such\nranking, the 400 highest-ranked bonds that\ncomply with the following limitations are\nselected for inclusion in the Index and\nweighted by market value: (1) any single\nissuer is limited to 4% of the weight of the\nIndex and (2) to the extent a sector's weight\nin the MarketAxess U.S. Investment Grade Broad\nCorporate Bond Index (the \u201cBroad Market\nIndex\u201d) is 5% or greater, a sector's weight in\nthe Index is limited to 2.5% above such\nsector's weight in the Broad Market Index. The\nIndex is rebalanced and reconstituted monthly\nafter the close of business on the last\nbusiness day of the month (the \u201cIndex\nRebalance Date\u201d) based on determinations made\non the fourth to last business day preceding\nthe Index Rebalance Date (the \u201cIndex\nDetermination Date\u201d). Securities eligible for\ninclusion in the Index include senior and\nsubordinated debt, callable and puttable\nbonds, Rule 144A securities and Regulation S\nsecurities. As of April 30, 2022, a\nsignificant portion of the Index comprised\ncompanies in the financial sector, although\nthis may change from time to time. As of April\n30, 2022, there were 400 securities in the\nIndex. The Index is sponsored by MarketAxess\nTechnologies Inc. (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings\nof the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex. 2 Table of Contents Principal Risks of\nInvesting in the Fund As with all investments,\nthere are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and\nyou could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other\npublic health issues, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation,\nwhich may limit both the amounts and types of\nloans and other financial commitments they can\nmake, the interest rates and fees they can\ncharge, the scope of their activities, the\nprices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost\nof capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally\nmay cause an adverse impact in a broad range\nof markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally,\nthereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets. Certain events in\nthe financial sector may cause an unusually\nhigh degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause\ncertain financial services companies to incur\nlarge losses. Securities of financial services\ncompanies may experience a dramatic decline in\nvalue when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of\ntheir assets, take action to raise capital\n(such as the issuance of debt or equity\nsecurities), or cease operations. Credit\nlosses resulting from financial difficulties\nof borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can negatively\nimpact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse\neconomic, business or political developments\ncould adversely affect financial institutions\nengaged in mortgage finance or other lending\nor investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Income\nRisk: The Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors.\nIssuers of securities held by the Fund may\ncall or redeem the securities during periods\nof falling interest rates, and the Fund would\nlikely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation\nheld by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates. 3\nTable of Contents Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of\nthe Index and the Fund in turn makes similar\nchanges to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. The Fund may\nrecognize gains as a result of rebalancing or\nreconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in\nthe Index. The Fund also may be required to\ndistribute any such gains to its shareholders\nto avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track\nthe performance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of correlation with the Index),\nthe Fund's return may not match the return of\nthe Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, generally as a result\nof cash flows into or out of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held by the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track\nthe Index return by investing in fewer than\nall of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index,\npotentially increasing the risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's return and that of the\nIndex. Less Experienced Index Provider Risk:\nThe Index was created by and is owned and\nmaintained by the Index Provider. The Index\nProvider has a limited history of experience\nas an index provider, which may create\nadditional risks for investing in the Fund.\nThere is no assurance that Index data, Index\ncomputations or Index construction will be\nfree from error, or that any such errors will\nbe identified and corrected in a timely manner\nor at all. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. New Fund Risk: The Fund is new and\nthere is no assurance that the Fund will grow\nquickly. When the Fund's size is small, the\nFund may experience low trading volume, which\ncould lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, the Fund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if the Fund does not meet certain\nconditions of the listing exchange. Any\nresulting liquidation of the Fund could cause\nelevated transaction costs for the Fund and\nnegative tax consequences for its\nshareholders. Non-U.S. Securities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards comparable to those in the\nUnited States. Further, such entities and/or\ntheir securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities market\nstructures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. Foreign governments may impose\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital to\nthe U.S. In addition, to the extent\ninvestments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have\na more significant impact on the Fund. Certain\ncountries have recently experienced (or\ncurrently are expected to experience) negative\ninterest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate\nconditions may be experienced in other\nregions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify the Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and\nperformance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Restricted Securities Risk: The\nFund may hold securities that have not been\nregistered for sale to the public under the\nU.S. federal securities laws. There can be no\nassurance that a trading market will exist at\nany time for any particular restricted\nsecurity. Limitations on the resale of these\nsecurities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them promptly at reasonable\nprices. The Fund may 4 Table of Contents have\nto bear the expense of registering the\nsecurities for resale and the risk of\nsubstantial delays in effecting the\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may\nbe difficult to value because market\nquotations may not be readily available, and\nthe securities may have significant\nvolatility. Subordinated Debt Risk: The Fund\nmay invest in debt securities that are\nsubordinated to more senior securities of the\nissuer. Holders of debt securities that are\nsubordinated or \u201cjunior\u201d to more senior\nsecurities are entitled to payment after\nholders of more senior securities.\nSubordinated debt securities are more likely\nto suffer a credit loss than non-subordinated\nsecurities of the same issuer, may be\ndisproportionately affected by a default,\ndowngrade or perceived decline in\ncreditworthiness, and may take longer to\nrecover interest or principal. Swaps Risk: A\nswap is a two-party contract that generally\nobligates the parties to exchange payments\nbased on a specified reference security,\nbasket of securities, security index or index\ncomponent. Swaps can involve greater risks\nthan direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to\ncounterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a\ncounterparty's defaulting on the obligation or\nbankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It\nmay not be possible for the Fund to liquidate\na swap position at an advantageous time or\nprice, which may result in significant losses.\nValuation Risk: Some portfolio holdings,\npotentially a large portion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the\nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a\nportfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. Zero-Coupon Bond Risk: Zero-coupon\nbonds usually trade at a deep discount from\ntheir face or par values and are subject to\ngreater market value fluctuations from\nchanging interest rates than debt obligations\nof comparable maturities that make current\ndistributions of interest. Fund Performance\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this Prospectus.Once the Fund has\ncompleted a full calendar year of operations,\na bar chart and table will be included that\nwill provide some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing the\nvariability of the Fund's returns based on net\nassets and comparing the Fund's performance to\nthe Index. When available, updated performance\ninformation may be obtained by calling\n1-866-787-2257or visiting the Fund's website:\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Portfolio\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to the Fund.\nPortfolio Managers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are David Marchetti, Frank Miethe and\nBradley Sullivan. David Marchetti, CFA, is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. He joined the Adviser in 2013. Frank\nMiethe, CFA, is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed\nIncome Beta Solutions Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2010. Bradley Sullivan, CFA, is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2015. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. 5 Table of Contents\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased\nand sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the\n\u201cExchange\u201d), other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from a tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or\nvisit your financial intermediary's website\nfor more information. 6 Table of Contents\nAdditional Strategies Information Principal\nStrategies General . Please see \u201cThe Fund's\nPrincipal Investment Strategy\u201d section under\n\u201cFund Summary\u201d above for a complete discussion\nof the Fund's principal investment strategy.\nThe Fund may invest in various types of\nsecurities and engage in various investment\ntechniques which are not the principal focus\nof the Fund and therefore are not described in\nthis Prospectus. These securities, techniques\nand practices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain\nfree of charge by contacting shareholder\nservices (see the back cover of this\nProspectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of\nthe Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e.,\nobtain a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex). A number of factors may affect the\nFund's ability to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index, and there can be\nno guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high\ndegree of correlation. For example, the Fund\nmay not be able to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index when there are\npractical difficulties or substantial costs\ninvolved in compiling a portfolio of\nsecurities to follow the Index, when a\nsecurity in the Index becomes temporarily\nilliquid, unavailable or less liquid, or legal\nrestrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from\ninvesting in a security in the Index. The\nAdviser will utilize a sampling strategy in\nmanaging the Fund. Sampling means that the\nAdviser uses quantitative analysis to select\nsecurities, including securities in the Index,\noutside of the Index and derivatives that have\na similar investment profile as the Index in\nterms of key risk factors, performance\nattributes and other economic characteristics.\nThese include industry weightings, market\ncapitalization, and other financial\ncharacteristics of securities. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nIn addition, from time to time, securities are\nadded to or removed from the Index. The\nAdviser may sell securities that are\nrepresented in the Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in the\nIndex, in anticipation of their removal from\nor addition to the Index. Further, the Adviser\nmay choose to overweight securities in the\nIndex, purchase or sell securities not in the\nIndex, or utilize various combinations of\nother available techniques, in seeking to\ntrack the Index. The Fund, as described in the\nSAI, has adopted a non-fundamental investment\npolicy to invest at least 80% of its net\nassets, plus the amount of borrowings for\ninvestment purposes, in investments suggested\nby its name, measured at the time of\ninvestment. The Fund will provide shareholders\nwith at least 60 days' notice prior to any\nchange in this non-fundamental 80% investment\npolicy. The Board of Trustees of the Trust\n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change the Fund's investment\nstrategy, Index and other policies without\nshareholder approval, except as otherwise\nindicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI.\nThe Board may also change the Fund's\ninvestment objective without shareholder\napproval. Non-Principal Strategies Certain\nOther Investments . The Fund may invest in\nstructured notes (notes on which the amount of\nprincipal repayment and interest payments are\nbased on the movement of one or more specified\nfactors such as the movement of a particular\nsecurity or index), options and futures\ncontracts. Options and futures contracts and\nstructured notes may be used by the Fund in\nseeking performance that corresponds to its\nIndex and in managing cash flows. Temporary\nDefensive Positions . In certain situations or\nmarket conditions, the Fund may temporarily\ndepart from its normal investment policies and\nstrategies, provided that the alternative is\nconsistent with the Fund's investment\nobjective and is in the best interest of the\nFund. For example, the Fund may make larger\nthan normal investments in derivatives to\nmaintain exposure to its Index if it is unable\nto invest directly in a component security.\nBorrowing Money . The Fund may borrow money\nfrom a bank as permitted by the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d),\nor other governing statute, by the Rules\nthereunder, or by the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other\nregulatory agency with authority over the\nFund, but only for temporary or emergency\npurposes. The Fund may also invest in reverse\nrepurchase agreements, which are considered\nborrowings under the 1940 Act. Although the\n1940 Act presently allows the Fund to borrow\nfrom any bank (including pledging, mortgaging\nor hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33\n1/ 3% of its total assets (not including\ntemporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of\nits total assets), and there is no percentage\nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nunder normal circumstances any borrowings by\nthe Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's\ntotal assets. 7 Table of Contents Lending of\nSecurities . The Fund may lend its portfolio\nsecurities in an amount not to exceed 40% of\nthe value of its net assets via a securities\nlending program through its securities lending\nagent, State Street Bank and Trust Company\n(\u201cState Street\u201d or the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to\nbrokers, dealers and other financial\ninstitutions desiring to borrow securities to\ncomplete transactions and for other purposes.\nA securities lending program allows the Fund\nto receive a portion of the income generated\nby lending its securities and investing the\nrespective collateral. The Fund will receive\ncollateral for each loaned security which is\nat least equal to the market value of that\nsecurity, marked to market each trading day.\nTo the extent the Fund receives cash\ncollateral, as of the date of this Prospectus,\nthe Adviser expects to invest such cash\ncollateral in a fund managed by the Adviser\nthat invests in: a broad range of money market\ninstruments; certificates of deposit and time\ndeposits of U.S. and foreign banks; commercial\npaper and other high quality obligations of\nU.S. or foreign companies; asset-backed\nsecurities; mortgage-related securities;\nrepurchase agreements; and shares of money\nmarket funds. In the securities lending\nprogram, the borrower generally has the right\nto vote the loaned securities; however, the\nFund may call loans to vote proxies if a\nmaterial issue affecting the Fund's economic\ninterest in the investment is to be voted\nupon. Security loans may be terminated at any\ntime by the Fund. Additional Risk Information\nThe following section provides information\nregarding the principal risks identified under\n\u201cPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund\u201d in\nthe Fund Summary along with additional risk\ninformation. Principal Risks Call/Prepayment\nRisk . Call/prepayment risk is the risk that\nan issuer will exercise its right to pay\nprincipal on an obligation held by the Fund\nearlier than expected or required. This may\noccur, for example, when there is a decline in\ninterest rates, and an issuer of bonds or\npreferred stock redeems the bonds or stock in\norder to replace them with obligations on\nwhich it is required to pay a lower interest\nor dividend rate. It may also occur when there\nis an unanticipated increase in the rate at\nwhich mortgages or other receivables\nunderlying mortgage- or asset-backed\nsecurities held by the Fund are prepaid. In\nany such case, the Fund may be forced to\ninvest the prepaid amounts in lower-yielding\ninvestments, resulting in a decline in the\nFund's income. Counterparty Risk . The Fund\nwill be subject to credit risk with respect to\nthe counterparties with which the Fund enters\ninto derivatives contracts and other\ntransactions such as repurchase agreements or\nreverse repurchase agreements. The Fund's\nability to profit from these types of\ninvestments and transactions will depend on\nthe willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund may be unable to\nterminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. The Fund may experience\nsignificant delays in obtaining any recovery\nin an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any\ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in\nsuch circumstances. If the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by its counterparty, it may\nbe delayed or prevented from realizing on the\ncollateral in the event of a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if the Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another institution being\nsubstituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, the\nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the\nfinancial institution's authority, the\nfinancial institution's liabilities could be\nwritten down, eliminated or converted into\nequity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial\ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of its securities and, if the\nFund holds such securities or has entered into\na transaction with such a financial security\nwhen a bail-in occurs, the Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Credit Risk . Credit risk\nis the risk that an issuer, guarantor or\nliquidity provider of a fixed-income security\nheld by the Fund may be unable or unwilling,\nor may be perceived (whether by market\nparticipants, ratings agencies, pricing\nservices or otherwise) as unable or unwilling,\nto make timely principal and/or interest\npayments, or to otherwise honor its\nobligations. It includes the risk that the\nsecurity will be downgraded by a credit rating\nagency; generally, lower credit quality\nissuers present higher credit risks. An actual\nor perceived decline in creditworthiness of an\nissuer of a fixed- 8 Table of Contents income\nsecurity held by the Fund may result in a\ndecrease in the value of the security. It is\npossible that the ability of an issuer to meet\nits obligations will decline substantially\nduring the period when the Fund owns\nsecurities of the issuer or that the issuer\nwill default on its obligations or that the\nobligations of the issuer will be limited or\nrestructured. The credit rating assigned to\nany particular investment does not necessarily\nreflect the issuer's current financial\ncondition and does not reflect an assessment\nof an investment's volatility or liquidity.\nSecurities rated in the lowest category of\ninvestment-grade are considered to have\nspeculative characteristics. If a security\nheld by the Fund loses its rating or its\nrating is downgraded, the Fund may nonetheless\ncontinue to hold the security in the\ndiscretion of the Adviser. In the case of\nasset-backed or mortgage-related securities,\nchanges in the actual or perceived ability of\nthe obligors on the underlying assets or\nmortgages to make payments of interest and/or\nprincipal may affect the values of those\nsecurities. Debt Securities Risk . The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, a\ndecline in the Fund's income and yield, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Derivatives Risk. A derivative is\na financial contract the value of which\ndepends on, or is derived from, the value of\nan underlying asset, interest rate, or index.\nDerivative transactions typically involve\nleverage and may have significant volatility.\nIt is possible that a derivative transaction\nwill result in a loss greater than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may\nnot be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price.\nRisks associated with derivative instruments\ninclude potential changes in value in response\nto interest rate changes or other market\ndevelopments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential\nfor the derivative transaction not to have the\neffect the Adviser anticipated or a different\nor less favorable effect than the Adviser\nanticipated; the failure of the counterparty\nto the derivative transaction to perform its\nobligations under the transaction or to settle\na trade; possible mispricing or improper\nvaluation of the derivative instrument;\nimperfect correlation in the value of a\nderivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that the\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that the Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including, without\nlimitation, absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to\nthe Fund due to losses on the transaction and\nan increase in volatility; the potential for\nthe derivative transaction to have the effect\nof accelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. Swaps\nRisk. A swap is a two-party contract that\ngenerally obligates the parties to exchange\npayments based on a specified reference\nsecurity, basket of securities, security index\nor index component. Swaps can involve greater\nrisks than direct investment in securities\nbecause swaps may be leveraged and are subject\nto counterparty risk (e.g. , the risk of a\ncounterparty's defaulting on the obligation or\nbankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e. , swaps may be difficult to value).\nSwaps may also be considered illiquid. It may\nnot be possible for the Fund to liquidate a\nswap position at an advantageous time or\nprice, which may result in significant losses.\n9 Table of Contents Extension Risk. During\nperiods of rising interest rates, the average\nlife of certain types of securities may be\nextended because of slower-than-expected\nprincipal payments. This may increase the\nperiod of time during which an investment\nearns a below-market interest rate, increase\nthe security's duration and reduce the value\nof the security. Extension risk may be\nheightened during periods of adverse economic\nconditions generally, as payment rates decline\ndue to higher unemployment levels and other\nfactors. Financial Sector Risk. Financial\nservices companies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which may limit both\nthe amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may\ncause an unusually high degree of volatility\nin the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to\nraise capital (such as the issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or cease operations.\nCredit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses\nassociated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or\npolitical developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage\nfinance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk\n. The net asset value of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund's securities holdings. The\nmarket prices of Fund Shares will generally\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the\nFund's net asset value and supply and demand\nof Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be\npredicted whether Fund Shares will trade\nbelow, at or above their net asset value.\nPrice differences may be due, in large part,\nto the fact that supply and demand forces at\nwork in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not\nidentical to, the same forces influencing the\nprices of the securities of the Index trading\nindividually or in the aggregate at any point\nin time. The market prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the net asset value\nof Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares\ncan be created and redeemed in Creation Units\n(unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable discounts\nfrom, and sometimes at premiums to, their net\nasset value), the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to the\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from the Fund's net asset value.\nIf an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a\ntime when the market price is at a discount to\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, then the\ninvestor may sustain losses. Income Risk. The\nFund's income may decline due to falling\ninterest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem\nthe securities during periods of falling\ninterest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying\nlower interest rates. If an obligation held by\nthe Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment in other obligations\npaying income at lower rates. A reduction in\nthe income earned by the Fund may limit the\nFund's ability to achieve its objective.\nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk . The\nFund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance\nof an unmanaged index of securities. The Fund\nwill seek to provide investment results that\ncorrespond generally to the performance of the\nIndex, regardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. The\nFund generally will buy and will not sell a\nsecurity included in the Index as long as the\nsecurity is part of the Index regardless of\nany sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the\nsecurity, even though the Adviser may make a\ndifferent investment decision for other\nactively managed accounts or portfolios that\nhold the security. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms and\nby comparison with other indices) and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the 10 Table of Contents\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with\nits methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the Fund\nand its shareholders. While the Adviser seeks\nto track the performance of the Index (i.e.,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's return may not match the\nreturn of the Index for a number of reasons.\nFor example, the return on the sample of\nsecurities purchased by the Fund (or the\nreturn on securities not included in the\nIndex) may not correlate precisely with the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, either as a result of\ncash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves\nof cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may attempt to track the Index\nreturn by investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the\nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes\nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact the Fund's\nability to match the return of the Index. The\nAdviser may apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or\ninvestment techniques to refine or limit the\nnumber or types of issuers included in the\nIndex in which the Fund may invest.\nApplication of such screens or techniques may\nresult in investment performance below that of\nthe Index and may not produce results expected\nby the Adviser. Index tracking risk may be\nheightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nPursuant to the Index methodology, a security\nmay be removed from the Index in the event\nthat it does not comply with the eligibility\nrequirements of the Index. As a result, the\nFund may be forced to sell securities at\ninopportune times and/or unfavorable prices\ndue to these changes in the Index components.\nWhen there are changes made to the component\nsecurities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio to\nattempt to increase the correlation between\nthe Fund's portfolio and the Index, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnscheduled changes to the Index may expose\nthe Fund to additional tracking error risk.\nThe Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities\nholdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its\nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income\ntax consequences. Interest Rate Risk .\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the\nsecurities held by the Fund will decline in\nvalue because of increases in market interest\nrates. Duration is a measure used to determine\nthe sensitivity of a security's price to\nchanges in interest rates. Debt securities\nwith longer durations tend to be more\nsensitive to changes in interest rates,\nusually making them more volatile than debt\nsecurities with shorter durations. For\nexample, the value of a security with a\nduration of five years would be expected to\ndecrease by 5% for every 1% increase in\ninterest rates. Falling interest rates also\ncreate the potential for a decline in the\nFund's income and yield. Interest-only and\nprincipal-only securities are especially\nsensitive to interest rate changes, which can\naffect not only their prices but can also\nchange the income flows and repayment\nassumptions about those investments. Variable\nand floating rate securities also generally\nincrease or decrease in value in response to\nchanges in interest rates, although generally\nto a lesser degree than fixed-rate securities.\nA substantial increase in interest rates may\nalso have an adverse impact on the liquidity\nof a security, especially those with longer\ndurations. Interest rate changes can be sudden\nand unpredictable, and are influenced by a\nnumber of factors, including government\npolicy, monetary policy, inflation\nexpectations, perceptions of risk, and supply\nand demand for bonds. Changes in government or\ncentral bank policy, including changes in tax\npolicy or changes in a central bank's\nimplementation of specific policy goals, may\nhave a substantial impact on interest rates.\nThis could lead to heightened levels of\ninterest rate, volatility and liquidity risks\nfor the fixed income markets generally and\ncould have a substantial and immediate effect\non the values of the Fund's investments. There\ncan be no guarantee that any particular\ngovernment or central bank policy will be\ncontinued, discontinued or changed, nor that\nany such policy will have the desired effect\non interest rates. Less Experienced Index\nProvider Risk . The Index was created by and\nis owned and maintained by the Index Provider.\nThe Index Provider has a limited history of\nexperience as an index provider, which may\ncreate additional risks for investing in the\nFund. There is no assurance that Index data,\nIndex computations or Index construction will\nbe free from error, or that any such errors\nwill be identified and corrected in a timely\nmanner or at all. Leveraging Risk . Borrowing\ntransactions, reverse repurchase agreements,\ncertain derivatives transactions, securities\nlending transactions and other investment\ntransactions such as when-issued, delayed-\ndelivery, or forward commitment transactions\nmay create investment leverage. If the Fund\nengages in transactions that have a leveraging\neffect on the Fund's investment portfolio, the\nvalue of the Fund will be potentially more\nvolatile and all other risks will tend to be\ncompounded. This is because leverage generally\ncreates investment risk with respect to a\nlarger base of assets than 11 Table of\nContents the Fund would otherwise have and so\nmagnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses to the Fund. Certain\nderivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause the\nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to\nmeet asset segregation or coverage\nrequirements. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk\nis the risk that the Fund may not be able to\ndispose of investments readily at a favorable\ntime or prices (or at all) or at prices\napproximating those at which the Fund\ncurrently values them. For example, certain\ninvestments may be subject to restrictions on\nresale, may trade in the over-the-counter\nmarket or in limited volume, or may not have\nan active trading market. Illiquid investments\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for the Fund to value illiquid\ninvestments accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. If the liquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of\nFund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares\nbeing less liquid. Disposal of illiquid\ninvestments may entail registration expenses\nand other transaction costs that are higher\nthan those for liquid investments. The Fund\nmay seek to borrow money to meet its\nobligations (including among other things\nredemption obligations) if it is unable to\ndispose of illiquid investments, resulting in\nborrowing expenses and possible leveraging of\nthe Fund. Market Risk . Market prices of\ninvestments held by the Fund will go up or\ndown, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The\nFund's investments are subject to changes in\ngeneral economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in\ninvestment in securities markets. Investment\nmarkets can be volatile, and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors, including, but not limited\nto, economic growth or recession, changes in\ninterest rates, changes in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in\nthe Fund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities\nprices. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. An outbreak of a respiratory\ndisease caused by a novel coronavirus (known\nas COVID-19) first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has resulted in a global\npandemic and major disruptions to economies\nand markets around the world, including the\nUnited States. Although the long-term economic\nfallout of COVID-19 is difficult to predict,\nit has contributed to, and may continue to\ncontribute to, market volatility, inflation\nand systemic economic weakness, and trading in\nmany instruments was and may continue to be\ndisrupted as a result. Liquidity for many\ninstruments was and may continue to be greatly\nreduced for periods of time. Some interest\nrates have been very low and in some cases\nyields are negative. Governments and central\nbanks, including the Federal Reserve in the\nUnited States, have taken extraordinary and\nunprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.\nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some\ntime. The foregoing could result in\ndisruptions to the services provided to the\nFund by its service providers. New Fund Risk .\nThe Fund is new and there is no assurance that\nthe Fund will grow quickly. When the Fund's\nsize is small, the Fund may experience low\ntrading volume, which could lead to wider\nbid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may\nface the risk of being delisted if the Fund\ndoes not meet certain conditions of the\nlisting exchange. Any resulting liquidation of\nthe Fund could cause elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative tax\nconsequences for its shareholders. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Investments in securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers entail risks not typically\nassociated with investing in securities of\nU.S. issuers. Similar risks may apply to\nsecurities traded on a U.S. securities\nexchange that are issued by entities with\nsignificant exposure to non-U.S. countries. In\ncertain countries, legal remedies available to\ninvestors may be more limited than those\navailable with regard to U.S. investments.\nThere may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to accounting, auditing, and\nfinancial reporting standards, regulatory\nframework and practices comparable to those in\nthe United States. The securities of some\nnon-U.S. entities are less liquid and at times\nmore volatile than securities of comparable\nU.S. entities, and could become subject to\nsanctions or embargoes that adversely affect\nthe Fund's 12 Table of Contents investment. In\naddition, there may be a possibility of\nnationalization or expropriation of assets,\nimposition of currency exchange controls,\nconfiscatory taxation, and diplomatic\ndevelopments that could adversely affect the\nvalues of the Fund's investments in issuers in\ncertain non-U.S. countries. Investments in\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers also are\nsubject to foreign political and economic risk\nnot associated with U.S. investments, meaning\nthat political events (civil unrest, national\nelections, changes in political conditions and\nforeign relations, imposition of exchange\ncontrols and repatriation restrictions),\nsocial and economic events (labor strikes,\nrising inflation) and natural disasters\noccurring in a country where the Fund invests\ncould cause the Fund's investments to\nexperience gains or losses. Certain countries\nhave recently experienced (or currently are\nexpected to experience) negative interest\nrates on certain fixed-income securities, and\nsimilar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in\nfixed-income securities with very low or\nnegative interest rates may magnify the Fund's\nsusceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such\ninvestments may be subject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced liquidity. Reinvestment\nRisk. Income from the Fund's portfolio may\ndecline when the Fund invests the proceeds\nfrom investment income, sales of portfolio\nsecurities or matured, traded or called debt\nobligations. For instance, during periods of\ndeclining interest rates, an issuer of debt\nobligations may exercise an option to redeem\nsecurities prior to maturity, forcing the Fund\nto reinvest the proceeds in lower-yielding\nsecurities. A decline in income received by\nthe Fund from its investments is likely to\nhave a negative effect on the yield and total\nreturn of the Fund Shares. Restricted\nSecurities Risk . The Fund may hold securities\nthat have not been registered for sale to the\npublic under the U.S. federal securities laws\npursuant to an exemption from registration.\nThese securities may be less liquid than\nsecurities registered for sale to the general\npublic. The liquidity of a restricted security\nmay be affected by a number of factors,\nincluding, among others: (i) the\ncreditworthiness of the issuer; (ii) the\nfrequency of trades and quotes for the\nsecurity; (iii) the number of dealers willing\nto purchase or sell the security and the\nnumber of other potential purchasers; (iv)\ndealer undertakings to make a market in the\nsecurity; (v) the nature of any legal\nrestrictions governing trading in the\nsecurity; and (vi) the nature of the security\nand the nature of marketplace trades. There\ncan be no assurance that a liquid trading\nmarket will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Also,\nrestricted securities may be difficult to\nvalue because market quotations may not be\nreadily available, and the securities may have\nsignificant volatility. Subordinated Debt Risk\n. The Fund may invest in debt securities that\nare subordinated to more senior securities of\nthe issuer. Holders of debt securities that\nare subordinated or \u201cjunior\u201d to more senior\nsecurities are entitled to payment after\nholders of more senior securities.\nSubordinated debt securities are more likely\nto suffer a credit loss than non-subordinated\nsecurities of the same issuer, may be\ndisproportionately affected by a default,\ndowngrade or perceived decline in\ncreditworthiness, and may take longer to\nrecover interest or principal. If there is a\ndefault, bankruptcy or liquidation of the\nissuer, most subordinated debt securities are\npaid only if sufficient assets remain after\npayment of the issuer's non-subordinated\nsecurities. Valuation Risk . Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. Technological issues or other service\ndisruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause the Fund to value\nits investments incorrectly. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the\nvalue established for it at any time, and it\nis possible that the Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby the Fund at that time. Zero-Coupon Bond\nRisk . Zero-coupon bonds are debt obligations\nthat are generally issued at a discount and\npayable in full at maturity, and that do not\nprovide for current payments of interest prior\nto maturity. Zero-coupon bonds usually trade\nat a deep discount from their face or par\nvalues and are subject to greater market value\nfluctuations from changing interest rates than\ndebt obligations of comparable maturities that\nmake current distributions of interest. When\ninterest rates rise, the values of zero-coupon\nbonds fall more rapidly than securities paying\ninterest on a current basis, because the Fund\nis unable to reinvest interest payments at the\nhigher rates. 13 Table of Contents Non-\nPrincipal Risks Authorized Participants,\nMarket Makers and Liquidity Providers\nConcentration Risk. The Fund has a limited\nnumber of financial institutions that may act\nas Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are\nresponsible for the creation and redemption\nactivity for the Fund. In addition, there may\nbe a limited number of market makers and/or\nliquidity providers in the marketplace. To the\nextent either of the following events occur,\nFund Shares may trade at a material discount\nto NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs\nexit the business or otherwise become unable\nto process creation and/or redemption orders\nand no other APs step forward to perform these\nservices, or (ii) market makers and/or\nliquidity providers exit the business or\nsignificantly reduce their business activities\nand no other entities step forward to perform\ntheir functions. Cash Transaction Risk . To\nthe extent the Fund sells portfolio securities\nto meet some or all of a redemption request\nwith cash, the Fund may incur taxable gains or\nlosses that it might not have incurred had it\nmade redemptions entirely in-kind. As a\nresult, the Fund may pay out higher annual\ncapital gain distributions than if the in-kind\nredemption process was used. Concentration\nRisk . The Fund's assets may be concentrated\nin an industry or group of industries, but\nonly to the extent that the Fund's underlying\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. When the Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or\nsector, financial, economic, business, and\nother developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have\na greater effect on the Fund than if it had\nnot focused its assets in that industry,\nmarket, or economic sector, which may increase\nthe volatility of the Fund. Conflicts of\nInterest Risk. An investment in the Fund will\nbe subject to a number of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest. For example, the\nAdviser or its affiliates may provide services\nto the Fund, such as securities lending agency\nservices, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer\nagency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for\nwhich the Fund would compensate the Adviser\nand/or such affiliates. The Fund may invest in\nother pooled investment vehicles sponsored,\nmanaged, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which the Fund pays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of the\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements. The Adviser and its\naffiliates serve as investment adviser to\nother clients and may make investment\ndecisions that may be different from those\nthat will be made by the Adviser on behalf of\nthe Fund. For example, the Adviser may provide\nasset allocation advice to some clients that\nmay include a recommendation to invest in or\nredeem from particular issuers while not\nproviding that same recommendation to all\nclients invested in the same or similar\nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to\npurchase (or sell) investments for the Fund\nand to sell (or purchase) the same investment\nfor accounts, funds, or structured products\nfor which it serves as asset manager, or for\nother clients or affiliates. The Adviser and\nits affiliates may invest for clients in\nvarious securities that are senior, pari\npassuor junior to, or have interests different\nfrom or adverse to, the securities that are\nowned by the Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material\nnonpublic confidential information that may\nrestrict the Adviser from purchasing\nsecurities or selling securities for itself or\nits clients (including the Fund) or otherwise\nusing such information for the benefit of its\nclients or itself. The foregoing does not\npurport to be a comprehensive list or complete\nexplanation of all potential conflicts of\ninterests which may affect the Fund. The Fund\nmay encounter circumstances, or enter into\ntransactions, in which conflicts of interest\nthat are not listed or discussed above may\narise. Costs of Buying and Selling Shares .\nInvestors buying or selling Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market will pay brokerage\ncommissions or other charges imposed by\nbrokers, as determined by that broker.\nBrokerage commissions are often a fixed amount\nand may be a significant proportional cost for\ninvestors seeking to buy or sell relatively\nsmall amounts of Fund Shares. In addition,\nsecondary market investors will also incur the\ncost of the difference between the price that\nan investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares\n(the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which an\ninvestor is willing to sell Fund Shares (the\n\u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask\nprices is often referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or\n\u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies\nover time for Fund Shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and is generally\nlower if Fund Shares have more trading volume\nand market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares\nhave little 14 Table of Contents trading\nvolume and market liquidity. Further,\nincreased market volatility may cause\nincreased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of\nbuying or selling Fund Shares, including\nbid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Fund\nShares may significantly reduce investment\nresults and an investment in Fund Shares may\nnot be advisable for investors who anticipate\nregularly making small investments.\nCybersecurity Risk . With the increased use of\ntechnologies such as the Internet and the\ndependence on computer systems to perform\nbusiness and operational functions, funds\n(such as the Fund) and their service providers\n(including the Adviser) may be prone to\noperational and information security risks\nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or\ntechnological malfunctions. In general, cyber-\nattacks are deliberate, but unintentional\nevents may have similar effects. Cyber-attacks\ninclude, among others, stealing or corrupting\ndata maintained online or digitally,\npreventing legitimate users from accessing\ninformation or services on a website,\nreleasing confidential information without\nauthorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns of, the Fund, the\nAdviser or a custodian, transfer agent, or\nother affiliated or third-party service\nprovider may adversely affect the Fund or its\nshareholders. For instance, cyber-attacks or\ntechnical malfunctions may interfere with the\nprocessing of shareholder or other\ntransactions, affect the Fund's ability to\ncalculate its NAV, cause the release of\nprivate shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject the\nFund to regulatory fines, penalties or\nfinancial losses, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and additional compliance\ncosts. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions\nmay render records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund\nShares, and other data integral to the\nfunctioning of the Fund inaccessible or\ninaccurate or incomplete. The Fund may also\nincur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents\nin the future. The Fund and its shareholders\ncould be negatively impacted as a result.\nWhile the Adviser has established a business\ncontinuity plan and systems designed to\nminimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the\nuse of technology, processes and controls,\nthere are inherent limitations in such plans\nand systems, including the possibility that\ncertain risks have not been identified, given\nthe evolving nature of this threat. The Fund\nrelies on third-party service providers for\nmany of its day-to-day operations, and will be\nsubject to the risk that the protections and\nprotocols implemented by those service\nproviders will be ineffective to protect the\nFund from cyber-attack. The Adviser does not\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems\nput in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may\nhave limited indemnification obligations to\nthe Adviser or the Fund. Similar types of\ncybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions\nalso are present for issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such\nissuers, and may cause the Fund's investment\nin such securities to lose value. Index\nConstruction Risk . A security included in the\nIndex may not exhibit the characteristic or\nprovide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently the Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that\ncharacteristic or exposure. Index Licensing\nRisk . It is possible that the license under\nwhich the Adviser or the Fund is permitted to\nreplicate or otherwise use the Index will be\nterminated or may be disputed, impaired or\ncease to remain in effect. In such a case, the\nAdviser may be required to replace the Index\nwith another index which it considers to be\nappropriate in light of the investment\nstrategy of the Fund. The use of any such\nsubstitute index may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's performance. In the event that the\nAdviser is unable to identify a suitable\nreplacement for the Index, it may determine to\nterminate the Fund. Money Market Risk . An\ninvestment in a money market fund is not a\ndeposit of any bank and is not insured or\nguaranteed by the FDIC or any other government\nagency. Certain money market funds seek to\npreserve the value of their shares at $1.00\nper share, although there can be no assurance\nthat they will do so, and it is possible to\nlose money by investing in such a money market\nfund. A major or unexpected change in interest\nrates or a decline in the credit quality of an\nissuer or entity providing credit support, an\ninactive trading market for money market\ninstruments, or adverse market, economic,\nindustry, political, regulatory, geopolitical,\nand other conditions could cause the share\nprice of such a money market fund to fall\nbelow $1.00. It is possible that such a money\nmarket fund will issue and redeem shares at\n$1.00 per share at times when the fair value\nof the money market fund's portfolio per share\nis more or less than $1.00. None of State\nStreet Corporation, State Street Bank and\nTrust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d), State Street\nGlobal Advisors, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or\ntheir affiliates (\u201cState Street Entities\u201d)\nguarantee the value of an investment in a\nmoney market fund at $1.00 per share.\nInvestors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market\nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV\nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the\nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be 15 Table of\nContents worth more or less than their\noriginal purchase price. Recent changes in the\nregulation of money market funds may affect\nthe operations and structures of money market\nfunds. A money market fund may be permitted or\nrequired to impose redemption fees or to\nimpose limitations on redemptions during\nperiods of high illiquidity in the markets for\nthe investments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . The Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to the Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nhave the effect of reducing the Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. The Fund may engage in frequent\ntrading of its portfolio securities in\nconnection with Index rebalancing. Frequent\ntrading may cause the Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent trading. Securities\nLending Risk. The Fund may lend portfolio\nsecurities in an amount not to exceed 40% of\nthe value of its net assets. For these\npurposes, net assets shall exclude the value\nof all assets received as collateral for the\nloan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by the\nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a\nloan transaction, as compensation for lending\nits securities, the Fund will receive a\nportion of the dividends or interest accrued\non the securities held as collateral or, in\nthe case of cash collateral, a portion of the\nincome from the investment of such cash. In\naddition, the Fund will receive the amount of\nall dividends, interest and other\ndistributions on the loaned securities.\nHowever, the borrower has the right to vote\nthe loaned securities. The Fund will call\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the investment is to be voted upon.\nEfforts to recall such securities promptly may\nbe unsuccessful, especially for foreign\nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and\nmay involve expenses to the Fund. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. Should the borrower\nof the securities fail financially, the Fund\nmay experience delays in recovering the\nsecurities or exercising its rights in the\ncollateral. Loans are made only to borrowers\nthat are deemed by the securities lending\nagent to be of good financial standing. In a\nloan transaction, the Fund will also bear the\nrisk of any decline in value of securities\nprovided as collateral or acquired with cash\ncollateral. The Fund will attempt to minimize\nthis risk by limiting the investment of cash\ncollateral to high quality instruments of\nshort maturity either directly on behalf of\nthe lending Fund or through one or more joint\naccounts or funds, which may include those\nmanaged by the Adviser. To the extent the\ncollateral provided or investments made with\ncash collateral differ from securities\nincluded in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss\nthan the securities included in the Index. In\naddition, the Fund will be subject to the risk\nthat any income generated by lending its\nsecurities or reinvesting cash collateral is\nlower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay\na borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute\npayments for dividends when overseeing the\nFund's securities lending activity. Trading\nIssues . Although Fund Shares are listed for\ntrading on the Exchange and may be listed or\ntraded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges\nother than the Exchange, there can be no\nassurance that an active trading market for\nthe Fund Shares will develop or be maintained.\nTrading in Fund Shares on the Exchange may be\nhalted due to market conditions or for reasons\nthat, in the view of the Exchange, make\ntrading in Fund Shares inadvisable. In\naddition, trading in Fund Shares on the\nExchange is subject to trading halts caused by\nextraordinary market volatility pursuant to\nExchange \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d rules. Similar to\nthe shares of operating companies listed on a\nstock exchange, Fund Shares may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility in the trading price of\nthe Fund's shares. While the Fund expects that\nthe ability of Authorized Participants to\ncreate and redeem Fund Shares at net asset\nvalue should be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of the Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. 16\n\nTable of Contents\n\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to the Fund and,\nsubject to the oversight of the Board, is\nresponsible for the investment management of\nthe Fund.

Neither waiver and/or reimbursement\nprovides for the recoupment by the Adviser of\nany amounts waived or reimbursed. The Adviser\nmay continue each waiver and/or reimbursement\nfrom year to year, but there is no guarantee\nthat the Adviser will do so and each waiver\nand/or reimbursement may be cancelled or\nmodified at any time after the end of its\ncurrent term.

The Adviser has ultimate\nresponsibility for the investment performance\nof the Fund due to its responsibility to\noversee each sub-adviser and recommend their\nhiring, termination and replacement. The\nAdviser is not required to disclose fees paid\nto any unaffiliated sub-adviser retained\npursuant to the order. Portfolio Managers.\nThe Fund is managed using a team of investment\nprofessionals. The team approach is used to\ncreate an environment that encourages the flow\nof investment ideas. The portfolio managers\nwithin the team work together in a cohesive\nmanner to develop and enhance techniques that\ndrive the investment process for the\ninvestment strategy. This approach requires\nportfolio managers to share a variety of\nresponsibilities including investment strategy\nand analysis while retaining responsibility\nfor the implementation of the strategy within\nany particular portfolio. The approach also\nenables the team to draw upon the resources of\nother groups within SSGA.

Additional\nPurchase and Sale Information Fund Shares are\nlisted for secondary trading on the Exchange\nand individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Juneteenth National Independence\nDay, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving\nDay and Christmas Day. The Exchange may close\nearly on the business day before certain\nholidays and on the day after Thanksgiving\nDay. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to\nchange without notice. If you buy or sell Fund\nShares in the secondary market, you will pay\nthe secondary market price for Fund Shares. In\naddition, you may incur customary brokerage\ncommissions and charges and may pay some or\nall of the spread between the bid and the\noffered price in the secondary market on each\nleg of a round trip (purchase and sale)\ntransaction. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nwill fluctuate continuously throughout trading\nhours based on market supply and demand rather\nthan the Fund's net asset value, which is\ncalculated at the end of each business day.\nFund Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nprices that may be above ( i.e., at a premium)\nor below ( i.e., at a discount), to varying 20\nTable of Contents degrees, the daily net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares. The trading prices of\nFund Shares may deviate significantly from the\nFund's net asset value during periods of\nmarket volatility. Given, however, that Fund\nShares can be issued and redeemed daily in\nCreation Units, the Adviser believes that\nlarge discounts and premiums to net asset\nvalue should not be sustained over long\nperiods. The Exchange will disseminate, every\nfifteen seconds during the regular trading\nday, an indicative optimized portfolio value\n(\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to the Fund. The IOPV\ncalculations are estimates of the value of the\nFund's net asset value per Fund Share.\nPremiums and discounts between the IOPV and\nthe market price may occur. This should not be\nviewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net\nasset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is based\non the current market value of the published\nbasket of portfolio securities and/or cash\nrequired to be deposited in exchange for a\nCreation Unit and does not necessarily reflect\nthe precise composition of the Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. When applicable, the\nIOPV price is based on quotes and closing\nprices from the securities' local market\nconverted into U.S. dollars at the current\ncurrency rates and may not reflect events that\noccur subsequent to the local market's close.\nTherefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best\npossible valuation of the Fund's current\nportfolio. Neither the Fund nor the Adviser or\nany of their affiliates are involved in, or\nresponsible for, the calculation or\ndissemination of such IOPVs and make no\nwarranty as to their accuracy. The Fund does\nnot impose any restrictions on the frequency\nof purchases and redemptions; however, the\nFund reserves the right to reject or limit\npurchases at any time as described in the SAI.\nWhen considering that no restriction or policy\nwas necessary, the Board evaluated the risks\nposed by market timing activities, such as\nwhether frequent purchases and redemptions\nwould interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of the Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause the Fund\nto experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional\nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and\nredeemed only in large quantities of shares\nknown as Creation Units, available only from\nthe Fund directly, and that most trading in\nthe Fund occurs on the Exchange at prevailing\nmarket prices and does not involve the Fund\ndirectly. Given this structure, the Board\ndetermined that it is unlikely that (a) market\ntiming would be attempted by the Fund's\nshareholders or (b) any attempts to market\ntime the Fund by shareholders would result in\nnegative impact to the Fund or its\nshareholders. Distributions Dividends and\nCapital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are\nentitled to your share of the Fund's income\nand net realized gains on its investments. The\nFund pays out substantially all of its net\nearnings to its shareholders as\n\u201cdistributions.\u201d The Fund may earn interest\nfrom debt securities and, if participating,\nsecurities lending income. The Fund will\ngenerally realize short-term capital gains or\nlosses whenever it sells or exchanges assets\nheld for one year or less. Net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be treated as\nordinary income when distributed to\nshareholders. The Fund will generally realize\nlong-term capital gains or losses whenever it\nsells or exchanges assets held for more than\none year. Net capital gains (the excess of the\nFund's net long-term capital gains over its\nnet short-term capital losses) are distributed\nto shareholders as \u201ccapital gain\ndistributions.\u201d Income dividend distributions,\nif any, are generally distributed to\nshareholders monthly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Net\ncapital gains for the Fund are distributed at\nleast annually. Dividends may be declared and\npaid more frequently or at any other time to\nimprove Index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nDistributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares\nonly if the broker through whom you purchased\nFund Shares makes such option available.\nDistributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as\nif such distributions had not been reinvested.\n21 Table of Contents Portfolio Holdings\nDisclosure The Fund's portfolio holdings\ndisclosure policy is described in the SAI. In\naddition, the identities and quantities of the\nsecurities held by the Fund are disclosed on\nthe Fund's website. Additional Tax Information\nThe following discussion is a summary of some\nimportant U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in the Fund. Your investment in the\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes On Distributions.\nIn general, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in the\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from\nthe Fund will generally be taxed as ordinary\nincome. Any distributions of the Fund's net\ncapital gains are taxable as long-term capital\ngain regardless of how long you have owned\nFund Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders\nat reduced rates. Distributions in excess of\nthe Fund's current and accumulated earnings\nand profits are treated as a tax-free return\nof capital to the extent of your basis in the\nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital\ngain thereafter. Since the Fund primarily\nholds investments that do not pay dividends,\nit is not expected that a substantial portion\n(if any) of the dividends paid by the Fund\nwill qualify for either the dividends-received\ndeduction for corporations or the favorable\nincome tax rates available to individuals on\nqualified dividend income. U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding specified thresholds are\nsubject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on\nall or a portion of their \u201cnet investment\nincome,\u201d which includes taxable interest,\ndividends and certain capital gains (generally\nincluding capital gain distributions and\ncapital gains realized upon the sale of Fund\nShares). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or\na portion of the undistributed net investment\nincome of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. Certain tax-exempt\neducational institutions will be subject to a\n1.4% tax on net investment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. Distributions paid in\nJanuary, but declared by the Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year,\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth, may be taxable to you in the calendar\nyear in which they were declared. The Fund\nwill inform you of the amount of your ordinary\nincome dividends and capital gain\ndistributions and any qualified dividend\nincome shortly after the close of each\ncalendar year. A distribution will reduce the\nFund's net asset value per Fund Share and may\nbe taxable to you as ordinary income or\ncapital gain even though, from an investment\nstandpoint, the distribution may constitute a\nreturn of capital. Original Issue Discount .\nInvestments by the Fund in zero coupon or\nother discount securities will result in\nincome to the Fund equal to a portion of the\nexcess face value of the securities over their\nissue price (the \u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or\n\u201cOID\u201d) each year that the securities are held,\neven though the Fund may receive no cash\ninterest payments or may receive cash interest\npayments that are less than the income\nrecognized for tax purposes. In other\ncircumstances, whether pursuant to the terms\nof a security or as a result of other factors\noutside the control of the Fund, the Fund may\nrecognize income without receiving a\ncommensurate amount of cash. The Fund's share\nof such income is included in determining the\namount that the Fund must distribute to\nmaintain its eligibility for treatment as a\nregulated investment company and to avoid the\npayment of federal tax, including the\nnondeductible 4% excise tax. Because any\nincome required to be recognized as a result\nof the OID and/or market discount rules\n(discussed below) may not be matched by a\ncorresponding cash payment, the Fund may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand eliminate taxes at the Fund level.\nInflation-Indexed Bonds. Special rules apply\nif the Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds.\nGenerally, all stated interest on inflation-\nindexed bonds is taken into income by the Fund\nunder its regular method of accounting for\ninterest income. The amount of any positive\ninflation adjustment for a taxable year, which\nresults from an increase in the inflation-\nadjusted principal amount of the bond, is\ntreated as OID. The amount of the Fund's OID\nin a taxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund's taxable income for such\nyear without a corresponding receipt of cash\nuntil the bond matures. As a result, the Fund\nmay need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for such\n22 Table of Contents year. The amount of any\nnegative inflation adjustments, which result\nfrom a decrease in the inflation-adjusted\nprincipal amount of the bond, first reduces\nthe amount of interest (including stated\ninterest, OID, and market discount, if any)\notherwise includible in the Fund's income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year; any\nremaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain\ncircumstances, carried forward to reduce the\namount of interest income taken into account\nwith respect to the bond in future taxable\nyears. Market Discount. Any market discount\nrecognized on a market discount bond is\ntaxable as ordinary income. A market discount\nbond is a bond acquired in the secondary\nmarket at a price below redemption value or\nbelow adjusted issue price if the bond was\nissued with original issue discount. Absent an\nelection by the Fund to include the market\ndiscount in income as it accrues, the gain on\nthe Fund's disposition of such an obligation\nwill be treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued\nmarket discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the market\ndiscount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash payment, the Fund may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand eliminate taxes at the Fund level,\npotentially resulting in additional taxable\ngain or loss to the Fund. Derivatives and\nOther Complex Securities. The Fund may invest\nin complex securities. These investments may\nbe subject to numerous special and complex\nrules. These rules could affect whether gains\nand losses recognized by the Fund are treated\nas ordinary income or capital gain, accelerate\nthe recognition of income to the Fund and/or\ndefer the Fund's ability to recognize losses.\nIn turn, these rules may affect the amount,\ntiming or character of the income distributed\nto you by the Fund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding the application\nof these rules. Foreign Income Taxes.\nInvestment income received by the Fund from\nsources within foreign countries may be\nsubject to foreign income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The United States has entered into\ntax treaties with many foreign countries which\nmay entitle the Fund to a reduced rate of such\ntaxes or exemption from taxes on such income.\nIt is impossible to determine the effective\nrate of foreign tax for the Fund in advance\nsince the amount of the assets to be invested\nwithin various countries is not known. If more\nthan 50% of the total assets of the Fund at\nthe close of its taxable year consist of\ncertain foreign stocks or securities, the Fund\nmay elect to \u201cpass through\u201d to you certain\nforeign income taxes (including withholding\ntaxes) paid by the Fund. If the Fund in which\nyou hold Fund Shares makes such an election,\nyou will be considered to have received as an\nadditional dividend your share of such foreign\ntaxes, but you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income, or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If the Fund does not so elect, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a deduction for\ncertain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund.\nUnder certain circumstances, if the Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign taxes paid in\nrespect of a prior year, the value of Fund\nShares could be affected or any foreign tax\ncredits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign\ntaxes for the current year could be reduced.\nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund Shares is generally treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for more than one year and as short-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for one year or less, except that any\ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held\nfor six months or less is treated as long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to the Fund\nShares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of\nCreation Units. A person who exchanges\nsecurities for Creation Units generally will\nrecognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss\nwill be equal to the difference between the\nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time\nand the exchanger's aggregate basis in the\nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for\nthe Creation Units. A person who exchanges\nCreation Units for securities will generally\nrecognize a gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the exchanger's basis in\nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss\nrealized upon an exchange of securities for\nCreation Units cannot be deducted currently\nunder the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on\nthe basis that there has been no significant\nchange in economic position. Persons\nexchanging securities should consult their own\ntax advisor with respect to whether wash sale\nrules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. 23 Table of Contents Under current\nfederal tax laws, any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon a redemption (or creation) of\nCreation Units is generally treated as long-\nterm capital gain or loss if the Fund Shares\n(or securities surrendered) have been held for\nmore than one year and as a short-term capital\ngain or loss if the Fund Shares (or securities\nsurrendered) have been held for one year or\nless. If you create or redeem Creation Units,\nyou will be sent a confirmation statement\nshowing how many Fund Shares you purchased or\nsold and at what price. The Trust, on behalf\nof the Fund, has the right to reject an order\nfor Creation Units if the purchaser (or a\ngroup of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund and if,\npursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the Fund\nwould have a basis in the securities different\nfrom the market value of the securities on the\ndate of deposit. The Trust also has the right\nto require information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser\n(or group of purchasers) will not recognize\ngain or loss upon the exchange of securities\nfor Creation Units. If the Fund redeems\nCreation Units in cash, it may bear additional\ncosts and recognize more capital gains than it\nwould if it redeems Creation Units in-kind.\nNon-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income dividends\npaid by the Fund to shareholders who are non-\nresident aliens or foreign entities will\ngenerally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax (other than distributions reported by the\nFund as interest-related dividends and short-\nterm capital gain dividends), unless a lower\ntreaty rate applies or unless such income is\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, the Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of\nits net income derived from U.S. source\ninterest, and the Fund may report short-term\ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains\non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a trade or business within the\nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax\nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of the\nFund's shares are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment. Unless certain\nnon-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply\nwith IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding\nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions payable to such\nentities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt\nfrom the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement. Backup Withholding. The Fund will\nbe required in certain cases to withhold (as\n\u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts payable to\nany shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States.\nOther Tax Issues. The Fund may be subject to\ntax in certain states where the Fund does\nbusiness (or is treated as doing business as a\nresult of its investments). Furthermore, in\nthose states which have income tax laws, the\ntax treatment of the Fund and of Fund\nshareholders with respect to distributions by\nthe Fund may differ from federal tax\ntreatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes\nsome of the consequences under current federal\nincome tax law of an investment in the Fund.\nIt is not a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. Consult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax consequences of an\ninvestment in the Fund under all applicable\ntax laws. 24 Table of Contents General\nInformation The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nIf shareholders of the Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled\nto one vote for each Fund Share they own.\nAnnual meetings of shareholders will not be\nheld except as required by the 1940 Act and\nother applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization The\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. From time to time, the\nFund may advertise yield and total return\nfigures. Yield is a historical measure of\ndividend income, and total return is a measure\nof past dividend income (assuming that it has\nbeen reinvested) plus capital appreciation.\nNeither yield nor total return should be used\nto predict the future performance of the Fund.\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel\nto the Trust, including the Fund. Ernst &\nYoung LLP serves as the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and will audit the\nFund's financial statements annually.\nFinancial Highlights The Fund had not\ncommenced operations prior to the date of this\nProspectus and, therefore, does not have\nfinancial information. 25\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhere to Learn More About the Fund This\nProspectus does not contain all the\ninformation included in the Registration\nStatement filed with the SEC with respect to\nFund Shares.

The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nThe offering of the Fund\u2019s shares (\u201cShares\u201d)\nis registered under the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The\ninvestment objective of the Fund is to provide\ninvestment results that, before fees and\nexpenses, correspond generally to the price\nand yield performance of a specified market\nindex (the \u201cIndex\u201d). SSGA Funds Management,\nInc. serves as the investment adviser for the\nFund (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), as further\ndescribed herein.\n\nThe Fund offers and issues Shares at their net\nasset value (sometimes referred to herein as\n\u201cNAV\u201d) only in aggregations of a specified\nnumber of Shares (each, a \u201cCreation Unit\u201d).\nThe Fund generally offers and issues Shares\neither in exchange for (i) a basket of\nsecurities designated by the Fund (\u201cDeposit\nSecurities\u201d) together with the deposit of a\nspecified cash payment (\u201cCash Component\u201d) or\n(ii) a cash payment equal in value to the\nDeposit Securities (\u201cDeposit Cash\u201d) together\nwith the Cash Component. The primary\nconsideration accepted by the Fund (i.e.,\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash) is set\nforth under \u201cPurchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units\u201d later in this SAI. The Trust\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of a \u201ccash in lieu\u201d amount to be\nadded to the Cash Component to replace any\nDeposit Security and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of Deposit Cash (subject to\napplicable legal requirements). The Shares\nhave been approved for listing and secondary\ntrading on a national securities exchange (the\n\u201cExchange\u201d). The Shares will trade on the\nExchange at market prices. These prices may\ndiffer from the Shares\u2019 net asset values. The\nShares are also redeemable only in Creation\nUnit aggregations, and generally in exchange\neither for (i) portfolio securities and a\nspecified cash payment or (ii) cash (subject\nto applicable legal requirements).\n\nShares may be issued in advance of receipt of\nDeposit Securities subject to various\nconditions including a requirement to maintain\non deposit with the Trust cash at least equal\nto a specified percentage of the market value\nof the missing Deposit Securities, as set\nforth in the Participant Agreement (as defined\nbelow). See \u201cPurchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units.\u201d The Trust may impose a\ntransaction fee for each creation or\nredemption. In all cases, such fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) applicable to management investment\ncompanies offering redeemable securities. In\naddition to the fixed creation or redemption\ntransaction fee, an additional transaction fee\nof up to three times the fixed creation or\nredemption transaction fee and/or an\nadditional variable charge may apply.\n                                              \n             INVESTMENT POLICIES              \n                                              \nThe Fund may invest in the following types of\ninvestments, consistent with its investment\nstrategies and objective. Please see the\nFund\u2019s Prospectus for additional information\nregarding its principal investment strategies.\n\nDIVERSIFICATION STATUS\n\nThe Fund is classified as a diversified\ninvestment company under the 1940 Act. Under\nthe 1940 Act, a diversified investment\ncompany, as to 75% of its total assets, may\nnot purchase securities of any issuer (other\nthan securities issued or guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, its agents or\ninstrumentalities or securities of other\ninvestment companies) if, as a result, more\nthan 5% of its total assets would be invested\nin the securities of such issuer, or more than\n10% of the issuer\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities would be held by the investment\ncompany.\n\nThe Fund intends to maintain the required\nlevel of diversification and otherwise conduct\nits operations so as to qualify as a\n\u201cregulated investment company\u201d (\u201cRIC\u201d) for\npurposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nas amended (the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d), and\nto relieve the Fund of any liability for\nfederal income tax to the extent that its\nearnings are distributed to shareholders.\nCompliance with the diversification\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code may\nseverely limit the investment flexibility of\nthe Fund and may make it less likely that the\nFund will meet its investment objective.\n\nASSET-BACKED AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED\nSECURITIES\n\nAsset-backed securities are securities backed\nby installment contracts, credit-card\nreceivables or other assets. Commercial\nmortgage-backed securities are securities\nbacked by commercial real estate properties.\nBoth asset-backed and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities represent interests in\n\u201cpools\u201d of assets in which payments of both\ninterest and principal on the securities are\nmade on a regular basis. The payments are, in\neffect, \u201cpassed through\u201d to the holder of the\nsecurities (net of any fees paid to the issuer\nor guarantor of the securities). The average\nlife of asset-backed and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities varies with the maturities\nof the underlying instruments and, as a result\nof prepayments, can often be less than the\noriginal maturity of the assets underlying the\nsecurities. For this and other reasons, an\nasset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurity\u2019s stated maturity may be shortened,\nand the security\u2019s total return may be\ndifficult to predict precisely.\n                      3                       \nBONDS\n\nA bond is an interest-bearing security issued\nby a company, governmental unit or, in some\ncases, a non-U.S. entity. The issuer of a bond\nhas a contractual obligation to pay interest\nat a stated rate on specific dates and to\nrepay principal (the bond\u2019s face value)\nperiodically or on a specified maturity date;\nprovided, however, a zero coupon bond pays no\ninterest to its holder during its life. The\nvalue of a zero coupon bond to the Fund\nconsists of the difference between such bond\u2019s\nface value at the time of maturity and the\nprice for which it was acquired, which may be\nan amount significantly less than its face\nvalue (sometimes referred to as a \u201cdeep\ndiscount\u201d price).\n\nAn issuer may have the right to redeem or\n\u201ccall\u201d a bond before maturity, in which case\nthe investor may have to reinvest the proceeds\nat lower market rates. Most bonds bear\ninterest income at a \u201ccoupon\u201d rate that is\nfixed for the life of the bond. The value of a\nfixed rate bond usually rises when market\ninterest rates fall, and falls when market\ninterest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed rate\nbond\u2019s yield (income as a percent of the\nbond\u2019s current value) may differ from its\ncoupon rate as its value rises or falls. Fixed\nrate bonds generally are also subject to\ninflation risk, which is the risk that the\nvalue of the bond or income from the bond will\nbe worth less in the future as inflation\ndecreases the value of money. This could mean\nthat, as inflation increases, the \u201creal\u201d value\nof the assets of the Fund holding fixed rate\nbonds can decline, as can the value of the\nFund\u2019s distributions. Other types of bonds\nbear income at an interest rate that is\nadjusted periodically. Because of their\nadjustable interest rates, the value of\n\u201cfloating-rate\u201d or \u201cvariable-rate\u201d bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed rate bonds. The Fund may treat some of\nthese bonds as having a shorter maturity for\npurposes of calculating the weighted average\nmaturity of its investment portfolio. Bonds\nmay be senior or subordinated obligations.\nSenior obligations generally have the first\nclaim on a corporation\u2019s earnings and assets\nand, in the event of liquidation, are paid\nbefore subordinated obligations. Bonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer\u2019s general\ncreditworthiness) or secured (also backed by\nspecified collateral).\n\nThe investment return of corporate bonds\nreflects interest on the bond and changes in\nthe market value of the bond. The market value\nof a corporate bond may be affected by the\ncredit rating of the corporation, the\ncorporation\u2019s performance and perceptions of\nthe corporation in the market place. There is\na risk that the issuers of the securities may\nnot be able to meet their obligations on\ninterest or principal payments at the time\ncalled for by such a security.\n\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER\n\nCommercial paper consists of short-term,\npromissory notes issued by banks, corporations\nand other entities to finance short-term\ncredit needs. These securities generally are\ndiscounted but sometimes may be interest\nbearing.\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\nThe Fund will concentrate its investments in\nsecurities of issuers in the same industry as\nmay be necessary to approximate the\ncomposition of the Fund\u2019s underlying Index.\nThe securities of issuers in particular\nindustries may dominate the benchmark Index of\nthe Fund and consequently the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio. This may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s performance or subject its\nShares to greater price volatility than that\nexperienced by less concentrated investment\ncompanies. The Trust\u2019s general policy is to\nexclude securities of the U.S. government and\nits agencies or instrumentalities when\nmeasuring industry concentration.\n\nIn pursuing its objective, the Fund may hold\nthe securities of a single issuer in an amount\nexceeding 10% of the market value of the\noutstanding securities of the issuer, subject\nto restrictions imposed by the Internal\nRevenue Code. In particular, as the Fund\u2019s\nsize grows and its assets increase, it will be\nmore likely to hold more than 10% of the\nsecurities of a single issuer if the issuer\nhas a relatively small public float as\ncompared to other components in its benchmark\nIndex.\n\nCONVERTIBLE SECURITIES\n\nConvertible securities are bonds, debentures,\nnotes, preferred stocks or other securities\nthat may be converted or exchanged (by the\nholder or by the issuer) into shares of the\nunderlying common stock (or cash or securities\nof equivalent value) at a stated exchange\nratio. A convertible security may also be\ncalled for redemption or conversion by the\nissuer after a particular date and under\ncertain circumstances (including a specified\nprice) established upon issue. If a\nconvertible security held by the Fund is\ncalled for redemption or conversion, the Fund\ncould be required to tender it for redemption,\nconvert it into the underlying common stock,\nor sell it to a third party.\n                      4                       \nConvertible securities generally have less\npotential for gain or loss than common stock.\nConvertible securities generally provide\nyields higher than underlying common stock,\nbut generally lower than comparable non-\nconvertible securities. Because of this higher\nyield, convertible securities generally sell\nat a price above their \u201cconversion value,\u201d\nwhich is the current market value of the stock\nto be received upon conversion. The difference\nbetween this conversion value and the price of\nconvertible securities will vary over time\ndepending on changes in the value of the\nunderlying common stock and interest rates.\nWhen the underlying common stock declines in\nvalue, convertible securities will tend not to\ndecline to the same extent because of the\ninterest or dividend payments and the\nrepayment of principal at maturity for certain\ntypes of convertible securities. However,\nsecurities that are convertible other than at\nthe option of the holder generally do not\nlimit the potential for loss to the same\nextent as securities convertible at the option\nof the holder. When the underlying common\nstock rises in value, the value of convertible\nsecurities may also be expected to increase.\nAt the same time, however, the difference\nbetween the market value of convertible\nsecurities and their conversion value will\nnarrow, which means that the value of\nconvertible securities will generally not\nincrease to the same extent as the value of\nthe underlying common stock. Because\nconvertible securities may also be interest-\nrate sensitive, their value may increase as\ninterest rates fall and decrease as interest\nrates rise. Convertible securities are also\nsubject to credit risk, and are often lower-\nquality securities.\n\nEXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS\n\nThe Fund may invest in other exchange-traded\nfunds (\u201cETFs\u201d) (including ETFs managed by the\nAdviser). ETFs may be structured as investment\ncompanies that are registered under the 1940\nAct, typically as open-end funds or unit\ninvestment trusts. These ETFs are generally\nbased on specific domestic and foreign market\nsecurities indices. An \u201cindex-based ETF\u201d seeks\nto provide investment results that match the\nperformance of an index by holding in its\nportfolio either the contents of the index or\na representative sample of the securities in\nthe index. An \u201cactively-managed ETF\u201d invests\nin securities based on an adviser\u2019s investment\nstrategy. An \u201cenhanced ETF\u201d seeks to provide\ninvestment results that match a positive or\nnegative multiple of the performance of an\nunderlying index. In seeking to provide such\nresults, an ETF and, in particular, an\nenhanced ETF, may engage in short sales of\nsecurities included in the underlying index\nand may invest in derivatives instruments,\nsuch as equity index swaps, futures contracts,\nand options on securities, futures contracts,\nand stock indices. Alternatively, ETFs may be\nstructured as grantor trusts or other forms of\npooled investment vehicles that are not\nregistered or regulated under the 1940 Act.\nThese ETFs typically hold commodities,\nprecious metals, currency or other non-\nsecurities investments. ETFs, like mutual\nfunds, have expenses associated with their\noperation, such as advisory and custody fees.\nWhen the Fund invests in an ETF, in addition\nto directly bearing expenses associated with\nits own operations, including the brokerage\ncosts associated with the purchase and sale of\nshares of the ETF, the Fund will bear a pro\nrata portion of the ETF\u2019s expenses. In\naddition, it may be more costly to own an ETF\nthan to directly own the securities or other\ninvestments held by the ETF because of ETF\nexpenses. The risks of owning shares of an ETF\ngenerally reflect the risks of owning the\nunderlying securities or other investments\nheld by the ETF, although lack of liquidity in\nthe market for the shares of an ETF could\nresult in the ETF\u2019s value being more volatile\nthan the underlying securities or other\ninvestments.\n\nFUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in\nderivatives, including exchange-traded futures\non indices, exchange-traded futures on\nTreasuries or Eurodollars, U.S. exchange-\ntraded or OTC put and call options contracts\nand exchange-traded or OTC swap transactions\n(including NDFs interest rate swaps, total\nreturn swaps, excess return swaps, and credit\ndefault swaps). The Fund will segregate cash\nand/or appropriate liquid assets if required\nto do so by current SEC or CFTC regulation or\ninterpretation.\n\nFutures and Options on Futures. Futures\ncontracts generally provide for the future\nsale by one party and purchase by another\nparty of a specified commodity or security at\na specified future time and at a specified\nprice. Index futures contracts are settled\ndaily with a payment by one party to the other\nof a cash amount based on the difference\nbetween the level of the index specified in\nthe contract from one day to the next. A\nfutures contract on an index is an agreement\npursuant to which two parties agree to take or\nmake delivery of an amount of cash equal to\nthe difference between the value of the index\nat the close of the last trading day of the\ncontract and the price at which the index\ncontract originally was written. Although the\nvalue of an index might be a function of the\nvalue of certain specified securities,\nphysical delivery of these securities is not\nalways made. A public market exists in futures\ncontracts covering a number of indexes, as\nwell as financial instruments, including,\nwithout limitation: U.S. Treasury bonds; U.S.\nTreasury notes; GNMA Certificates; three-month\nU.S. Treasury bills; 90-day commercial paper;\nbank certificates of deposit; Eurodollar\ncertificates of deposit; the Australian\nDollar; the Canadian Dollar; the British\nPound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss Franc; the\nMexican Peso; and certain multinational\ncurrencies, such as the Euro. It is expected\nthat other futures contracts will be developed\nand traded in the future. Futures contracts\nare standardized as to maturity date and\nunderlying instrument and are traded on\nfutures exchanges.\n\nThe Fund may purchase and write (sell) call\nand put options on futures. Options on futures\ngive the holder the right, in return for the\npremium paid, to assume a long position (call)\nor short position (put) in a futures contract\nat a specified exercise price upon expiration\nof, or at any time during the period of, the\noption. Upon exercise of a call option, the\nholder acquires a long position in the futures\ncontract and the writer is assigned the\nopposite short position. In the case of a put\noption, the opposite is true.\n\nThe Fund is required to make a good faith\nmargin deposit in cash or U.S. government\nsecurities (or other eligible collateral) with\na broker or custodian to initiate and maintain\nopen positions in futures contracts. A margin\ndeposit is intended to assure completion of\n                      5                       \nthe contract (delivery or acceptance of the\nunderlying commodity or payment of the cash\nsettlement amount) if it is not terminated\nprior to the specified delivery date. Brokers\nmay establish deposit requirements which are\nhigher than the exchange minimums. Futures\ncontracts are customarily purchased and sold\non margin deposits which may range upward from\nless than 5% of the value of the contract\nbeing traded.\n\nAfter a futures contract position is opened,\nthe value of the contract is marked to market\ndaily. If the futures contract price changes\nto the extent that the margin on deposit does\nnot satisfy price changes additional payments\nwill be required. Conversely, change in the\ncontract value may reduce the required margin,\nresulting in a repayment of excess margin to\nthe contract holder. Variation margin payments\nare made to and from the futures broker for as\nlong as the contract remains open. In such\ncase, the Fund would expect to earn interest\nincome on its margin deposits. Although some\nfutures contracts call for making or taking\ndelivery of the underlying commodity,\ngenerally these obligations are closed out\nprior to delivery by offsetting purchases or\nsales of matching futures contracts (involving\nthe same exchange, underlying security or\nindex and delivery month). If an offsetting\npurchase price is less than the original sale\nprice, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if\nit is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss.\nConversely, if an offsetting sale price is\nmore than the original purchase price, the\nFund realizes a capital gain, or if it is\nless, the Fund realizes a capital loss. The\ntransaction costs also must be included in\nthese calculations.\n\nOptions. The Fund may purchase and sell put\nand call options. Such options may relate to\nparticular securities and may or may not be\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\nissued by the Options Clearing Corporation.\nOptions trading is a highly specialized\nactivity that entails greater than ordinary\ninvestment risk. Options on particular\nsecurities may be more volatile than the\nunderlying securities, and therefore, on a\npercentage basis, an investment in options may\nbe subject to greater fluctuation than an\ninvestment in the underlying securities\nthemselves.\n\nShort Sales \u201cAgainst the Box.\u201d The Fund may\nengage in short sales \u201cagainst the box.\u201d In a\nshort sale against the box, the Fund agrees to\nsell at a future date a security that it\neither contemporaneously owns or has the right\nto acquire at no extra cost. If the price of\nthe security has declined at the time the Fund\nis required to deliver the security, the Fund\nwill benefit from the difference in the price.\nIf the price of the security has increased,\nthe Fund will be required to pay the\ndifference.\n\nSwap Transactions. The Fund may enter into\nswap transactions, including interest rate,\nswap, credit default swap, NDF, and total\nreturn swap transactions. Swap transactions\nare contracts between parties in which one\nparty agrees to make periodic payments to the\nother party based on the change in market\nvalue or level of a specified rate, index or\nasset. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake payments to the first party based on the\nreturn of a different specified rate, index or\nasset. Swap transactions will usually be done\non a net basis, i.e., where the two parties\nmake net payments with the Fund receiving or\npaying, as the case may be, only the net\namount of the two payments. The net amount of\nthe excess, if any, of the Fund\u2019s obligations\nover its entitlements with respect to each\nswap is accrued on a daily basis and an amount\nof cash or equivalents having an aggregate\nvalue at least equal to the accrued excess is\nmaintained by the Fund. Swaps may be used in\nconjunction with other instruments to offset\ninterest rate, currency or other underlying\nrisks. For example, interest rate swaps may be\noffset with \u201ccaps,\u201d \u201cfloors\u201d or \u201ccollars\u201d. A\n\u201ccap\u201d is essentially a call option which\nplaces a limit on the amount of floating rate\ninterest that must be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201cfloor\u201d is essentially a\nput option which places a limit on the minimum\namount that would be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201ccollar\u201d is essentially a\ncombination of a long cap and a short floor\nwhere the limits are set at different levels.\n\nThe use of swap transactions by the Fund\nentails certain risks, which may be different\nfrom, or possibly greater than, the risks\nassociated with investing directly in the\nsecurities and other investments that are the\nreferenced asset for the swap agreement. Swaps\nare highly specialized instruments that\nrequire investment techniques, risk analyses,\nand tax planning different from those\nassociated with stocks, bonds, and other\ntraditional investments. The use of a swap\nrequires an understanding not only of the\nreferenced asset, reference rate, or index,\nbut also of the swap itself, without the\nbenefit of observing the performance of the\nswap under all the possible market conditions.\nBecause some swap transactions have a leverage\ncomponent, adverse changes in the value or\nlevel of the underlying asset, reference rate,\nor index can result in a loss substantially\ngreater than the amount invested in the swap\nitself. Certain swaps have the potential for\nunlimited loss, regardless of the size of the\ninitial investment.\n\nBilateral OTC transactions differ from\nexchange-traded or cleared derivatives\ntransactions in several respects. Bilateral\nOTC transactions are transacted directly with\ndealers and not with a clearing corporation.\nWithout the availability of a clearing\ncorporation, bilateral OTC transaction pricing\nis normally done by reference to information\nfrom market makers and/or available index\ndata, which information is carefully monitored\nby the Adviser and verified in appropriate\ncases. As bilateral OTC transactions are\nentered into directly with a dealer, there is\na risk of nonperformance by the dealer as a\nresult of its insolvency or otherwise. Under\nrecently-adopted regulations by the CFTC and\nfederal banking regulators (\u201cMargin Rules\u201d),\nthe Fund is required to post collateral (known\nas variation margin) to cover the mark-to-\nmarket exposure in respect of its uncleared\nswaps. The Margin Rules also mandate that\ncollateral in the form of initial margin be\nposted to cover potential future exposure\nattributable to uncleared swap transactions.\nIn the event the Fund is required to post\ncollateral in the form of initial margin or\nvariation margin in respect of its uncleared\nswap transactions, all such collateral will be\nposted with a third party custodian pursuant\nto a triparty custody agreement between the\nFund, its dealer counterparty and an\nunaffiliated custodian.\n                      6                       \nThe requirement to execute certain OTC\nderivatives contracts on SEFs may offer\ncertain advantages over traditional bilateral\nOTC trading, such as ease of execution, price\ntransparency, increased liquidity and/or\nfavorable pricing. However, SEF trading may\nmake it more difficult and costly for the Fund\nto enter into highly tailored or customized\ntransactions and may result in additional\ncosts and risks. Market participants such as\nthe Fund that execute derivatives contracts\nthrough a SEF, whether directly or through a\nbroker intermediary, are required to submit to\nthe jurisdiction of the SEF and comply with\nSEF and CFTC rules and regulations which\nimpose, among other things disclosure and\nrecordkeeping obligations. In addition, the\nFund will generally incur SEF or broker\nintermediary fees when it trades on a SEF. The\nFund may also be required to indemnify the SEF\nor broker intermediary for any losses or costs\nthat may result from the Fund\u2019s transactions\non the SEF.\n\nTotal Return Swaps. The Fund may enter into\ntotal return swap transactions for investment\npurposes. Total return swaps are transactions\nin which one party agrees to make periodic\npayments based on the change in market value\nof the underlying assets, which may include a\nspecified security, basket of securities or\nsecurity indexes during the specified period,\nin return for periodic payments based on a\nfixed or variable interest rate of the total\nreturn from other underlying assets. Total\nreturn swaps may be used to obtain exposure to\na security or market without owning or taking\nphysical custody of such security or market,\nincluding in cases in which there may be\ndisadvantages associated with direct ownership\nof a particular security. In a typical total\nreturn equity swap, payments made by the Fund\nor the counterparty are based on the total\nreturn of a particular reference asset or\nassets (such as an equity security, a\ncombination of such securities, or an index).\nThat is, one party agrees to pay another party\nthe return on a stock, basket of stocks, or\nstock index in return for a specified interest\nrate. By entering into an equity index swap,\nfor example, the index receiver can gain\nexposure to stocks making up the index of\nsecurities without actually purchasing those\nstocks. Total return swaps involve not only\nthe risk associated with the investment in the\nunderlying securities, but also the risk of\nthe counterparty not fulfilling its\nobligations under the agreement.\n\nCredit Default Swaps. The Fund may enter into\ncredit default swap transactions for\ninvestment purposes. A credit default swap\ntransaction may have as reference obligations\none or more securities that are not currently\nheld by the Fund. The Fund may be either the\nprotection buyer or protection seller in the\ntransaction. Credit default swaps may also be\nstructured based on the debt of a basket of\nissuers, rather than a single issuer, and may\nbe customized with respect to the default\nevent that triggers purchase or other factors.\nAs a protection seller, the Fund would\ngenerally receive an upfront payment or a\nfixed rate of income throughout the term of\nthe swap, which typically is between six\nmonths and three years, provided that there is\nno credit event. If a credit event occurs,\ngenerally the protection seller must pay the\nprotection buyer the full face amount of the\nreference obligations that may have little or\nno value. The notional value of the credit\ndefault swap will be used to segregate liquid\nassets for selling protection on credit\ndefault swaps. If the Fund were a protection\nbuyer and no credit event occurred during the\nterm of the swap, the Fund would recover\nnothing if the swap were held through its\ntermination date. However, if a credit event\noccurred, the protection buyer may elect to\nreceive the full notional value of the swap in\nexchange for an equal face amount of the\nreference obligation that may have little or\nno value. Where the Fund is the protection\nbuyer, credit default swaps involve the risk\nthat the seller may fail to satisfy its\npayment obligations to the Fund in the event\nof a default. The purchase of credit default\nswaps involves costs, which will reduce the\nFund\u2019s return. When the Fund buys credit\ndefault swaps it will segregate an amount at\nleast equal to the amount of any accrued\npremium payment obligations including amounts\nfor early terminations.\n\nCurrency Swaps. The Fund may enter into\ncurrency swap transactions for investment\npurposes. Currency swaps are similar to\ninterest rate swaps, except that they involve\nmultiple currencies. The Fund may enter into a\ncurrency swap when it has exposure to one\ncurrency and desires exposure to a different\ncurrency. Typically, the interest rates that\ndetermine the currency swap payments are\nfixed, although occasionally one or both\nparties may pay a floating rate of interest.\nUnlike an interest rate swap, however, the\nprincipal amounts are exchanged at the\nbeginning of the contract and returned at the\nend of the contract. In addition to paying and\nreceiving amounts at the beginning and end of\nthe transaction, both sides will have to pay\nin full on a periodic basis based upon the\ncurrency they have borrowed. Change in foreign\nexchange rates and changes in interest rates,\nas described above, may negatively affect\ncurrency swaps.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps. The Fund may enter into\nan interest rate swap in an effort to protect\nagainst declines in the value of fixed income\nsecurities held by the Fund. In such an\ninstance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed\nrate (multiplied by a notional amount) while a\ncounterparty agrees to pay a floating rate\n(multiplied by the same notional amount). If\ninterest rates rise, resulting in a diminution\nin the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio, the Fund\nwould receive payments under the swap that\nwould offset, in whole or in part, such\ndiminution in value.\n\nOptions on Swaps. An option on a swap\nagreement, or a \u201cswaption,\u201d is a contract that\ngives a counterparty the right (but not the\nobligation) to enter into a new swap agreement\nor to shorten, extend, cancel or otherwise\nmodify an existing swap agreement, at some\ndesignated future time on specified terms. In\nreturn, the purchaser pays a \u201cpremium\u201d to the\nseller of the contract. The seller of the\n                      7                       \ncontract receives the premium and bears the\nrisk of unfavorable changes on the underlying\nswap. The Fund may write (sell) and purchase\nput and call swaptions. The Fund may also\nenter into swaptions on either an asset-based\nor liability-based basis, depending on whether\nthe Fund is hedging its assets or its\nliabilities. The Fund may write (sell) and\npurchase put and call swaptions to the same\nextent it may make use of standard options on\nsecurities or other instruments. The Fund may\nenter into these transactions primarily to\npreserve a return or spread on a particular\ninvestment or portion of its holdings, as a\nduration management technique, to protect\nagainst an increase in the price of securities\nthe Fund anticipates purchasing at a later\ndate, or for any other purposes, such as for\nspeculation to increase returns. Swaptions are\ngenerally subject to the same risks involved\nin the Fund\u2019s use of options.\n\nDepending on the terms of the particular\noption agreement, the Fund will generally\nincur a greater degree of risk when it writes\na swaption than it will incur when it\npurchases a swaption. When the Fund purchases\na swaption, it risks losing only the amount of\nthe premium it has paid should it decide to\nlet the option expire unexercised. However,\nwhen the Fund writes a swaption, upon exercise\nof the option the Fund will become obligated\naccording to the terms of the underlying\nagreement.\n\nGovernment Regulation.The Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the\n\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) that was signed into law on\nJuly 21, 2010 created a new statutory\nframework that comprehensively regulated the\nover-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives markets\nfor the first time. Prior to the Dodd-Frank\nAct, the OTC derivatives markets were\ntraditionally traded on a bilateral basis (so-\ncalled \u201cbilateral OTC transactions\u201d). Under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, certain OTC derivatives\ntransactions are now required to be centrally\ncleared and traded on exchanges or electronic\ntrading platforms called swap execution\nfacilities (\u201cSEFs\u201d).\n\nOn October 28, 2020, the SEC adopted Rule\n18f-4 (the \u201cDerivatives Rule\u201d) under the 1940\nAct which, following an implementation period,\nwill replace existing SEC and staff guidance\nwith an updated, comprehensive framework for\nregistered funds\u2019 use of derivatives. Among\nother changes, the Derivatives Rule will\nrequire the Fund to trade derivatives and\ncertain other instruments that create future\npayment or delivery obligations subject to a\nvalue-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) leverage limit, develop\nand implement a derivatives risk management\nprogram and new testing requirements, and\ncomply with new requirements related to board\nand SEC reporting. These new requirements will\napply unless the Fund qualifies as a \u201climited\nderivatives user,\u201d as defined in the\nDerivatives Rule. To the extent the Fund uses\nderivatives, complying with the Derivatives\nRule may increase the cost of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments and cost of doing business, which\ncould adversely affect investors. Other new\nregulations could adversely affect the value,\navailability and performance of certain\nderivative instruments, may make them more\ncostly, and may limit or restrict their use by\nthe Fund.\n\nRegulation Under the Commodity Exchange Act.\nThe Fund intends to use commodity interests,\nsuch as futures, swaps and options on futures\nin accordance with Rule 4.5 of the CEA. The\nFund may use exchange-traded futures and\noptions on futures, together with positions in\ncash and money market instruments, to simulate\nfull investment in its underlying Index.\nExchange-traded futures and options on futures\ncontracts may not be currently available for\nthe Index. Under such circumstances, the\nAdviser may seek to utilize other instruments\nthat it believes to be correlated to the\napplicable Index components or a subset of the\ncomponents. An exclusion from the definition\nof the term \u201ccommodity pool operator\u201d has been\nclaimed with respect to each series of the\nTrust in accordance with Rule 4.5 such that\nregistration or regulation as a commodity pool\noperator under the CEA is not necessary.\n\nRestrictions on Trading in Commodity\nInterests. The Fund reserves the right to\nengage in transactions involving futures,\noptions thereon and swaps to the extent\nallowed by the CFTC regulations in effect from\ntime to time and in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\npolicies. The Fund would take steps to prevent\nits futures positions from \u201cleveraging\u201d its\nsecurities holdings. When it has a long\nfutures position, it will maintain with its\ncustodian bank assets substantially identical\nto those underlying the contract or cash and\nequivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position). When it has a\nshort futures position, it will maintain with\nits custodian bank assets substantially\nidentical to those underlying the contract or\ncash and equivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position).\n\nCertain additional risk factors related to\nderivatives are discussed below:\n\nDerivatives Risk. Under recently adopted rules\nby the CFTC, transactions in some types of\ninterest rate swaps and index credit default\nswaps on North American and European indices\nare required to be cleared. In addition, the\nCFTC may promulgate additional regulations\nthat require clearing of other classes of\nswaps. In a cleared derivatives transaction\n(which includes commodities futures and\ncleared swaps transactions), the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty is a clearing house (such as CME,\nICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet), rather than\na bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a\nmember of a clearing house and only members of\na clearing house can participate directly in\nthe clearing house, the Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers, who are futures commission merchants\nthat are members of the clearing houses and\nwho have the appropriate regulatory approvals\nto engage in cleared swap transactions. The\nFund makes and receives payments owed under\ncleared derivatives transactions (including\nmargin payments) through its accounts at\nclearing members. Clearing members guarantee\nperformance of their clients\u2019 obligations to\nthe clearing house. In contrast to bilateral\nOTC transactions, clearing members generally\ncan require termination of existing cleared\nderivatives transactions at any time and\nincreases in margin above the\n                      8                       \nmargin that it required at the beginning of a\ntransaction. Clearing houses also have broad\nrights to increase margin requirements for\nexisting transactions and to terminate\ntransactions. Any such increase or termination\ncould interfere with the ability of the Fund\nto pursue its investment strategy. Also, the\nFund is subject to execution risk if it enters\ninto a derivatives transaction that is\nrequired to be cleared (or that the Advisor\nexpects to be cleared), and no clearing member\nis willing or able to clear the transaction on\nthe Fund\u2019s behalf. While the documentation in\nplace between the Fund and its clearing\nmembers generally provides that the clearing\nmembers will accept for clearing all\ntransactions submitted for clearing that are\nwithin credit limits specified by the clearing\nmembers in advance, the Fund could be subject\nto this execution risk if the Fund submits for\nclearing transactions that exceed such credit\nlimits, if the clearing house does not accept\nthe transactions for clearing, or if the\nclearing members do not comply with their\nagreement to clear such transactions. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of any increase in the\nvalue of the transaction after the time of the\ntransaction. In addition, new regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict the Fund\u2019s\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to\nthe Fund of, derivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund or increasing\nmargin or capital requirements. If the Fund is\nnot able to enter into a particular\nderivatives transaction, the Fund\u2019s investment\nperformance and risk profile could be\nadversely affected as a result.\n\nCounterparty Risk. Counterparty risk with\nrespect to OTC derivatives may be affected by\nnew regulations promulgated by the CFTC and\nSEC affecting the derivatives market. As\ndescribed under \u201cDerivatives Risk\u201d above, some\nderivatives transactions are required to be\ncleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives\ntransaction is subject to the credit risk of\nthe clearing house and the clearing member\nthrough which it holds its cleared derivatives\nposition, rather than the credit risk of its\noriginal counterparty to the derivative\ntransaction. Clearing members are required to\nsegregate all funds received from customers\nwith respect to cleared derivatives\ntransactions from the clearing member\u2019s\nproprietary assets. However, all funds and\nother property received by a clearing broker\nfrom its customers are generally held by the\nclearing broker on a commingled basis in an\nomnibus account, which may also invest those\nfunds in certain instruments permitted under\nthe applicable regulations. Also, the clearing\nmember transfers to the clearing house the\namount of margin required by the clearing\nhouse for cleared derivatives transactions,\nwhich amounts are generally held in the\nrelevant omnibus account at the clearing house\nfor all customers of the clearing member.\n\nFor commodities futures positions, the\nclearing house may use all of the collateral\nheld in the clearing member\u2019s omnibus account\nto meet a loss in that account, without regard\nto which customer in fact supplied that\ncollateral. Accordingly, in addition to\nbearing the credit risk of its clearing\nmember, each customer to a futures transaction\nalso bears \u201cfellow customer\u201d risk from other\ncustomers of the clearing member. However,\nwith respect to cleared swaps positions,\nrecent regulations promulgated by the CFTC\nrequire that the clearing member notify the\nclearing house of the amount of initial margin\nprovided by the clearing member to the\nclearing house that is attributable to each\ncustomer. Because margin in respect of cleared\nswaps must be earmarked for specific clearing\nmember customers, the clearing house may not\nuse the collateral of one customer to cover\nthe obligations of another customer. However,\nif the clearing member does not provide\naccurate reporting, the Fund is subject to the\nrisk that a clearing house will use the Fund\u2019s\nassets held in an omnibus account at the\nclearing house to satisfy payment obligations\nof a defaulting customer of the clearing\nmember to the clearing house. In addition,\nclearing members may generally choose to\nprovide to the clearing house the net amount\nof variation margin required for cleared swaps\nfor all of its customers in the aggregate,\nrather than the gross amount for each\ncustomer.\n\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nThe Fund may take advantage of opportunities\nin the area of options and futures contracts,\noptions on futures contracts, warrants, swaps\nand any other investments which are not\npresently contemplated for use by the Fund or\nwhich are not currently available but which\nmay be developed, to the extent such\nopportunities are both consistent with the\nFund\u2019s investment objective and legally\npermissible for the Fund. Before entering into\nsuch transactions or making any such\ninvestment, the Fund will provide appropriate\ndisclosure.\n\nHIGH YIELD SECURITIES\n\nInvestment in high yield securities (commonly\nknown as \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) generally provides\ngreater income and increased opportunity for\ncapital appreciation than investments in\nhigher quality securities, but they also\ntypically entail greater price volatility and\ncredit risk. These high yield securities are\nregarded as predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the issuer\u2019s continuing ability to\nmeet principal and interest payments. Analysis\nof the creditworthiness of issuers of debt\nsecurities that are high yield may be more\ncomplex than for issuers of higher quality\ndebt securities. In addition, high yield\nsecurities are often issued by smaller, less\ncreditworthy companies or by highly leveraged\n(indebted) firms, but can also be issued by\ngovernments. Such issuers are generally less\nable than more financially stable issuers to\nmake scheduled payments of interest and\nprincipal. The risks posed by securities\nissued under such circumstances are\nsubstantial.\n\nInvesting in high yield debt securities\ninvolves risks that are greater than the risks\nof investing in higher quality debt\nsecurities. These risks include: (i) changes\nin credit status, including weaker overall\ncredit conditions of issuers and risks of\ndefault; (ii) industry, market and economic\nrisk; and (iii) greater price variability and\ncredit risks of certain high yield securities\nsuch as zero coupon and payment-in-kind\nsecurities. While these risks provide the\nopportunity for maximizing return over time,\nthey may result in greater volatility of the\nvalue of the Fund than a fund that invests in\nhigher-rated securities.\n                      9                       \nFurthermore, the value of high yield\nsecurities may be more susceptible to real or\nperceived adverse economic, company or\nindustry conditions than is the case for\nhigher quality securities. The market values\nof certain of these lower-rated and unrated\ndebt securities tend to reflect individual\nissuer developments to a greater extent than\ndo higher-rated securities which react\nprimarily to fluctuations in the general level\nof interest rates, and tend to be more\nsensitive to economic conditions than are\nhigher-rated securities. Adverse market,\ncredit or economic conditions could make it\ndifficult at certain times to sell certain\nhigh yield securities held by the Fund.\n\nThe secondary market on which high yield\nsecurities are traded may be less liquid than\nthe market for higher grade securities. Less\nliquidity in the secondary trading market\ncould adversely affect the price at which the\nFund could sell a high yield security, and\ncould adversely affect the daily net asset\nvalue per share of the Fund. When secondary\nmarkets for high yield securities are less\nliquid than the market for higher grade\nsecurities, it may be more difficult to value\nthe securities because there is less reliable,\nobjective data available.\n\nThe use of credit ratings as a principal\nmethod of selecting high yield securities can\ninvolve certain risks. For example, credit\nratings evaluate the safety of principal and\ninterest payments, not the market value risk\nof high yield securities. Also, credit rating\nagencies may fail to change credit ratings in\na timely fashion to reflect events since the\nsecurity was last rated.\n\nILLIQUID INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in illiquid investments.\nThe Fund may not acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid investment means any\ninvestment that the Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. If illiquid investments exceed 15%\nof the Fund\u2019s net assets, certain remedial\nactions will be taken as required by Rule\n22e-4 under the 1940 Act and the Fund\u2019s\npolicies and procedures.\n\nINFLATION-PROTECTED OBLIGATIONS\n\nThe Fund may invest in inflation-protected\nobligations, commonly known as \u201cTIPS,\u201d of the\nU.S. Treasury, as well as TIPS of major\ngovernments and emerging market countries,\nexcluding the United States. TIPS are a type\nof security issued by a government that are\ndesigned to provide inflation protection to\ninvestors. TIPS are income-generating\ninstruments whose interest and principal\npayments are adjusted for inflation\u2014a\nsustained increase in prices that erodes the\npurchasing power of money. The inflation\nadjustment, which is typically applied monthly\nto the principal of the bond, follows a\ndesignated inflation index, such as the\nConsumer Price Index. A fixed coupon rate is\napplied to the inflation-adjusted principal so\nthat as inflation rises or falls, both the\nprincipal value and the interest payments will\nincrease or decrease. This can provide\ninvestors with a hedge against inflation, as\nit helps preserve the purchasing power of an\ninvestment. Because of this inflation\nadjustment feature, inflation-protected bonds\ntypically have lower yields than conventional\nfixed-rate bonds.\n\nINVESTMENT COMPANIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in the securities of other\ninvestment companies, including affiliated\nfunds and money market funds, subject to\napplicable limitations under Section 12(d)(1)\nof the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Section 12(d)(1),\nthe Fund may invest in the securities of\nanother investment company (the \u201cacquired\ncompany\u201d) provided that the Fund, immediately\nafter such purchase or acquisition, does not\nown in the aggregate: (i) more than 3% of the\ntotal outstanding voting stock of the acquired\ncompany; (ii) securities issued by the\nacquired company having an aggregate value in\nexcess of 5% of the value of the total assets\nof the Fund; or (iii) securities issued by the\nacquired company and all other investment\ncompanies (other than Treasury stock of the\nFund) having an aggregate value in excess of\n10% of the value of the total assets of the\nFund. To the extent allowed by law,\nregulation, and/or the Fund\u2019s investment\nrestrictions, the Fund may invest its assets\nin securities of investment companies,\nincluding affiliated funds and/or money market\nfunds, in excess of the limits discussed\nabove.\n\nIf the Fund invests in and, thus, is a\nshareholder of, another investment company,\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will indirectly bear\nthe Fund\u2019s proportionate share of the fees and\nexpenses paid by such other investment\ncompany, including advisory fees, in addition\nto both the management fees payable directly\nby the Fund to the Fund\u2019s own investment\nadviser and the other expenses that the Fund\nbears directly in connection with the Fund\u2019s\nown operations.\n                      10                      \nLENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may lend portfolio securities to\ncertain creditworthy borrowers in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. markets in an amount not to exceed\n40% of the value of its net assets. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is marked to\nmarket daily in an amount at least equal to\nthe current market value of the securities\nloaned. The Fund may terminate a loan at any\ntime and obtain the securities loaned. The\nFund receives the value of any interest or\ncash or non-cash distributions paid on the\nloaned securities. The Fund cannot vote\nproxies for securities on loan, but may recall\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the Fund\u2019s economic interest in the\ninvestment is to be voted upon. Efforts to\nrecall such securities promptly may be\nunsuccessful, especially for foreign\nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and\nmay involve expenses to the Fund.\nDistributions received on loaned securities in\nlieu of dividend payments (i.e., substitute\npayments) would not be considered qualified\ndividend income.\n\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower will be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. The Fund is compensated by the\ndifference between the amount earned on the\nreinvestment of cash collateral and the fee\npaid to the borrower. In the case of\ncollateral other than cash, the Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral may\nbe reinvested in certain high quality short-\nterm instruments either directly on behalf of\nthe Fund or through one or more joint accounts\nor funds, which may include those managed by\nthe Adviser. The Fund could lose money due to\na decline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or any investments made\nwith cash collateral. Certain non-cash\ncollateral or investments made with cash\ncollateral may have a greater risk of loss\nthan other non-cash collateral or investments.\n\nThe Fund may pay a portion of the interest or\nfees earned from securities lending to a\nborrower as described above, and to one or\nmore securities lending agents approved by the\nBoard of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d)\nwho administer the lending program for the\nFund in accordance with guidelines approved by\nthe Board. In such capacity, the lending agent\nprovides the following services to the Fund in\nconnection with the Fund\u2019s securities lending\nactivities: (i) locating borrowers among an\napproved list of prospective borrowers; (ii)\ncausing the delivery of loaned securities from\nthe Fund to borrowers; (iii) monitoring the\nvalue of loaned securities, the value of\ncollateral received, and other lending\nparameters; (iv) seeking additional\ncollateral, as necessary, from borrowers; (v)\nreceiving and holding collateral from\nborrowers, and facilitating the investment and\nreinvestment of all or substantially all cash\ncollateral in an investment vehicle designated\nby the Fund; (vi) returning collateral to\nborrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute\ndividend, interest, and other distribution\npayments to the Fund from borrowers; (viii)\nnegotiating the terms of each loan of\nsecurities, including but not limited to the\namount of any loan premium, and monitoring the\nterms of securities loan agreements with\nprospective borrowers for consistency with the\nrequirements of the Fund\u2019s Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement; (ix) selecting\nsecurities, including amounts (percentages),\nto be loaned; (x) recordkeeping and accounting\nservicing; and (xi) arranging for return of\nloaned securities to the Fund in accordance\nwith the terms of the Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement. State Street Bank and\nTrust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d), an affiliate\nof the Trust, has been approved by the Board\nto serve as securities lending agent for the\nFund and the Trust has entered into an\nagreement with State Street for such services.\nAmong other matters, the Trust has agreed to\nindemnify State Street for certain\nliabilities. State Street has received an\norder of exemption from the SEC under Sections\n17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the 1940 Act to serve\nas the lending agent for affiliated investment\ncompanies such as the Trust and to invest the\ncash collateral received from loan\ntransactions to be invested in an affiliated\ncash collateral fund.\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess especially so in certain international\nmarkets such as Taiwan), \u201cgap\u201d risk (i.e., the\nrisk of a mismatch between the return on cash\ncollateral reinvestments and the fees the Fund\nhas agreed to pay a borrower), risk of loss of\ncollateral, credit, legal, counterparty and\nmarket risk. If a securities lending\ncounterparty were to default, the Fund would\nbe subject to the risk of a possible delay in\nreceiving collateral or in recovering the\nloaned securities, or to a possible loss of\nrights in the collateral. In the event a\nborrower does not return the Fund\u2019s securities\nas agreed, the Fund may experience losses if\nthe proceeds received from liquidating the\ncollateral do not at least equal the value of\nthe loaned security at the time the collateral\nis liquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nAlthough State Street has agreed to provide\nthe Fund with indemnification in the event of\na borrower default, the Fund is still exposed\nto the risk of losses in the event a borrower\ndoes not return the Fund\u2019s securities as\nagreed. For example, delays in recovery of\nlent securities may cause the Fund to lose the\nopportunity to sell the securities at a\ndesirable price.\n\nLEVERAGING\n\nWhile the Fund does not anticipate doing so,\nthe Fund may borrow money in an amount greater\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets. However, under normal circumstances,\nthe Fund will not borrow money from a bank in\nan amount greater than 10% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s total assets. Borrowing for investment\npurposes is one form of leverage. Leveraging\ninvestments, by purchasing securities with\nborrowed money, is a speculative technique\nthat increases investment risk, but also\nincreases investment opportunity. Because\nsubstantially all of the Fund\u2019s assets will\nfluctuate in value, whereas the interest\nobligations on borrowings may be fixed, the\nNAV of the Fund will increase more when the\nFund\u2019s portfolio assets increase in value and\ndecrease more when the Fund\u2019s portfolio assets\ndecrease in value than would otherwise be the\ncase. Moreover, interest costs on borrowings\nmay fluctuate with changing market rates of\ninterest and may partially offset or exceed\nthe returns on the borrowed funds.\n                      11                      \nOTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser),\ncash and cash equivalents, on an ongoing basis\nto provide liquidity or for other reasons.\nMoney market instruments are generally short-\nterm investments that may include but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by the Adviser); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit\n(\u201cCDs\u201d), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nforeign banks (including foreign branches) and\nsimilar institutions; (iv) commercial paper\nrated at the date of purchase \u201cPrime-1\u201d by\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) or \u201cA-1\u201d\nby S&P Global Ratings (\u201cS&P\u201d), or if unrated,\nof comparable quality as determined by the\nAdviser; (v) non-convertible corporate debt\nsecurities (e.g., bonds and debentures) with\nremaining maturities at the date of purchase\nof not more than 397 days and that present\nminimal credit risks; and (vi) short-term U.S.\ndollar-denominated obligations of foreign\nbanks (including U.S. branches) that, in the\nopinion of the Adviser, are of comparable\nquality to obligations of U.S. banks which may\nbe purchased by the Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or a\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Money market\ninstruments also include shares of money\nmarket funds. The SEC and other government\nagencies continue to review the regulation of\nmoney market funds. The SEC has adopted\nchanges to the rules that govern money market\nfunds, and compliance with many of these\namendments was required in October 2016.\nLegislative developments may also affect money\nmarket funds. These changes and developments\nmay affect the investment strategies,\nperformance, yield, operating expenses and\ncontinued viability of a money market fund.\n\nPRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND RESTRICTED SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in securities that are\npurchased in private placements and,\naccordingly, are subject to restrictions on\nresale as a matter of contract or under\nfederal securities laws. While such private\nplacements may offer attractive opportunities\nfor investment not otherwise available on the\nopen market, the securities so purchased are\noften \u201crestricted securities,\u201d i.e.,\nsecurities which cannot be sold to the public\nwithout registration under the Securities Act\nor the availability of an exemption from\nregistration (such as Rules 144 or 144A), or\nwhich are not readily marketable because they\nare subject to other legal or contractual\ndelays in or restrictions on resale. Generally\nspeaking, restricted securities may be sold\nonly to qualified institutional buyers, or in\na privately negotiated transaction to a\nlimited number of purchasers, or in limited\nquantities after they have been held for a\nspecified period of time and other conditions\nare met pursuant to an exemption from\nregistration, or in a public offering for\nwhich a registration statement is in effect\nunder the Securities Act.\n\nBecause there may be relatively few potential\npurchasers for such investments, especially\nunder adverse market or economic conditions or\nin the event of adverse changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuer, the Fund\ncould find it more difficult to sell such\nsecurities when the Adviser believes it\nadvisable to do so or may be able to sell such\nsecurities only at prices lower than if such\nsecurities were more widely held. Market\nquotations for such securities are generally\nless readily available than for publicly\ntraded securities. The absence of a trading\nmarket can make it difficult to ascertain a\nmarket value for such securities for purposes\nof computing the Fund\u2019s net asset value, and\nthe judgment of the Adviser may at times play\na greater role in valuing these securities\nthan in the case of publicly traded\nsecurities. Disposing of such securities,\nwhich may be illiquid investments, can involve\ntime-consuming negotiation and legal expenses,\nand it may be difficult or impossible for the\nFund to sell them promptly at an acceptable\nprice. The Fund may have to bear the extra\nexpense of registering such securities for\nresale and the risk of substantial delay in\neffecting such registration.\n\nThe Fund may be deemed to be an \u201cunderwriter\u201d\nfor purposes of the Securities Act when\nselling restricted securities to the public,\nand in such event the Fund may be liable to\npurchasers of such securities if the\nregistration statement prepared by the issuer,\nor the prospectus forming a part of it, is\nmaterially inaccurate or misleading.\n\nRATINGS\n\nAn investment-grade rating means the security\nor issuer is rated investment-grade by\nMoody\u2019s, S&P, Fitch Ratings, Inc. (\u201cFitch\u201d),\nDominion Bond Rating Service Limited, or\nanother credit rating agency designated as a\nnationally recognized statistical rating\norganization by the SEC, or is unrated but\nconsidered to be of equivalent quality by the\nAdviser.\n\nSubsequent to purchase by the Fund, a rated\nsecurity may cease to be rated or its\ninvestment-grade rating may be reduced below\nan investment-grade rating. Bonds rated lower\nthan Baa3 by Moody\u2019s or BBB- by S&P or Fitch\nare below investment-grade quality and\n                      12                      \nare obligations of issuers that are considered\npredominantly speculative with respect to the\nissuer\u2019s capacity to pay interest and repay\nprincipal according to the terms of the\nobligation and, therefore, carry greater\ninvestment risk, including the possibility of\nissuer default and bankruptcy and increased\nmarket price volatility. Such securities\n(\u201clower rated securities\u201d) are commonly\nreferred to as \u201cjunk bonds\u201d and are subject to\na substantial degree of credit risk. Lower\nrated securities are often issued by smaller,\nless creditworthy companies or by highly\nleveraged (indebted) firms, which are\ngenerally less able than more financially\nstable firms to make scheduled payments of\ninterest and principal. The risks posed by\nsecurities issued under such circumstances are\nsubstantial. Bonds rated below investment-\ngrade tend to be less marketable than higher-\nquality bonds because the market for them is\nless broad. The market for unrated bonds is\neven narrower. See \u201cHIGH YIELD SECURITIES\u201d\nabove for more information relating to the\nrisks associated with investing in lower rated\nsecurities, or Appendix C for more information\non the ratings of debt instruments.\n\nREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in repurchase agreements\nwith commercial banks, brokers or dealers to\ngenerate income from its excess cash balances\nand to invest securities lending cash\ncollateral. A repurchase agreement is an\nagreement under which the Fund acquires a\nfinancial instrument (e.g., a security issued\nby the U.S. government or an agency thereof, a\nbanker\u2019s acceptance or a certificate of\ndeposit) from a seller, subject to resale to\nthe seller at an agreed upon price and date\n(normally, the next Business Day \u2013 as defined\nbelow). A repurchase agreement may be\nconsidered a loan collateralized by\nsecurities. The resale price reflects an\nagreed upon interest rate effective for the\nperiod the instrument is held by the Fund and\nis unrelated to the interest rate on the\nunderlying instrument.\n\nIn these repurchase agreement transactions,\nthe securities acquired by the Fund (including\naccrued interest earned thereon) must have a\ntotal value in excess of the value of the\nrepurchase agreement and are held by the\nCustodian until repurchased. No more than an\naggregate of 15% of the Fund\u2019s net assets will\nbe invested in illiquid investments, including\nrepurchase agreements having maturities longer\nthan seven days and securities subject to\nlegal or contractual restrictions on resale,\nor for which there are no readily available\nmarket quotations.\n\nThe use of repurchase agreements involves\ncertain risks. For example, if the other party\nto the agreement defaults on its obligation to\nrepurchase the underlying security at a time\nwhen the value of the security has declined,\nthe Fund may incur a loss upon disposition of\nthe security. If the other party to the\nagreement becomes insolvent and subject to\nliquidation or reorganization under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or other laws, a court may\ndetermine that the underlying security is\ncollateral for a loan by the Fund not within\nthe control of the Fund and, therefore, the\nFund may not be able to substantiate its\ninterest in the underlying security and may be\ndeemed an unsecured creditor of the other\nparty to the agreement.\n\nREVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements, which involve the sale of\nsecurities with an agreement to repurchase the\nsecurities at an agreed-upon price, date and\ninterest payment and have the characteristics\nof borrowing. The securities purchased with\nthe funds obtained from the agreement and\nsecurities collateralizing the agreement will\nhave maturity dates no later than the\nrepayment date. Generally the effect of such\ntransactions is that the Fund can recover all\nor most of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are only\nadvantageous if the Fund has an opportunity to\nearn a greater rate of interest on the cash\nderived from these transactions than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available and the Fund intends to\nuse the reverse repurchase technique only when\nthe Adviser believes it will be advantageous\nto the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements may exaggerate any interim increase\nor decrease in the value of the Fund\u2019s assets.\nThe Fund\u2019s exposure to reverse repurchase\nagreements will be covered by securities\nhaving a value equal to or greater than such\ncommitments. Under the 1940 Act, reverse\nrepurchase agreements are considered\nborrowings. Although there is no percentage\nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nthe Fund does not expect to engage, under\nnormal circumstances, in reverse repurchase\nagreements with respect to more than 10% of\nits total assets.\n\nSOVEREIGN DEBT OBLIGATIONS\n\nSovereign debt obligations are issued or\nguaranteed by foreign governments or their\nagencies. Sovereign debt may be in the form of\nconventional securities or other types of debt\ninstruments such as loans or loan\nparticipations. Governmental entities\nresponsible for repayment of the debt may be\nunable or unwilling to repay principal and pay\ninterest when due, and may require\nrenegotiation or reschedule of debt payments.\nIn addition, prospects for repayment of\nprincipal and payment of interest may depend\non political as well as economic factors.\nAlthough some sovereign debt, such as Brady\nBonds, is collateralized by U.S. Government\nsecurities, repayment of principal and payment\nof interest is not guaranteed by the U.S.\nGovernment.\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nU.S. Government obligations are a type of\nbond. U.S. Government obligations include\nsecurities issued or guaranteed as to\nprincipal and interest by the U.S. Government,\nits agencies or instrumentalities.\n                      13                      \nOne type of U.S. Government obligation, U.S.\nTreasury obligations, are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. Treasury and\ndiffer only in their interest rates,\nmaturities, and times of issuance. U.S.\nTreasury bills have initial maturities of one-\nyear or less; U.S. Treasury notes have initial\nmaturities of one to ten years; and U.S.\nTreasury bonds generally have initial\nmaturities of greater than ten years.\n\nOther U.S. Government obligations are issued\nor guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities\nof the U.S. Government including, but not\nlimited to, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), the Government\nNational Mortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d),\nthe Small Business Administration, the Federal\nFarm Credit Administration, the Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d), the\nFederal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLB\u201d), Banks for\nCooperatives (including the Central Bank for\nCooperatives), the Federal Land Banks, the\nFederal Intermediate Credit Banks, the\nTennessee Valley Authority, the Export-Import\nBank of the United States, the Commodity\nCredit Corporation, the Federal Financing\nBank, the Student Loan Marketing Association,\nthe National Credit Union Administration and\nthe Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation\n(Farmer Mac). Some obligations issued or\nguaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and\ninstrumentalities, including, for example,\nGinnie Mae pass-through certificates, are\nsupported by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. Treasury. Other obligations issued by or\nguaranteed by federal agencies, such as those\nsecurities issued by Fannie Mae, are supported\nby the discretionary authority of the U.S.\nGovernment to purchase certain obligations of\nthe federal agency, while other obligations\nissued by or guaranteed by federal agencies,\nsuch as those of the Federal Home Loan Banks,\nare supported by the right of the issuer to\nborrow from the U.S. Treasury. While the U.S.\nGovernment provides financial support to such\nU.S. Government-sponsored federal agencies, no\nassurance can be given that the U.S.\nGovernment will always do so, since the U.S.\nGovernment is not so obligated by law.\n\nIn September 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced\na federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac, placing the two federal instrumentalities\nin conservatorship. Under the terms of the\ntakeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed to acquire\n$1 billion of senior preferred stock of each\ninstrumentality and obtained warrants for the\npurchase of common stock of each\ninstrumentality. Under these Senior Preferred\nStock Purchase Agreements (\u201cSPAs\u201d), the U.S.\nTreasury has pledged to provide a limited\namount of capital per instrumentality as\nneeded, including the contribution of cash\ncapital to the instrumentalities in the event\ntheir liabilities exceed their assets. In May\n2009, the U.S. Treasury increased its maximum\ncommitment to each instrumentality under the\nSPAs from $100 billion to $200 billion per\ninstrumentality. In December 2009, the U.S.\nTreasury amended the SPAs to provide Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac with some additional\nflexibility to meet the requirement to reduce\ntheir mortgage portfolios. Also in December\n2009, the U.S. Treasury further amended the\nSPAs to allow the cap on the U.S. Treasury\u2019s\nfunding commitment to increase as necessary to\naccommodate any cumulative reduction in Fannie\nMae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s net worth through the\nend of 2012. On August 17, 2012, the U.S.\nTreasury announced that it was again amending\nthe SPAs to terminate the requirement that\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac each pay a 10%\ndividend annually on all amounts received\nunder the funding commitment. Instead, they\nwere required to transfer to the U.S. Treasury\non a quarterly basis all profits earned during\na quarter that exceeded a capital reserve\namount of $3 billion. On September 30, 2019,\nthe U.S. Treasury announced amendments to the\nSPAs permitting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to\nmaintain capital reserves of $25 billion and\n$20 billion, respectively. It is believed that\nthe amendment puts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nin a better position to service their debt\nbecause the companies no longer have to borrow\nfrom the U.S. Treasury to make fixed dividend\npayments.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the subject of\nseveral continuing class action lawsuits and\ninvestigations by federal regulators over\ncertain accounting, disclosure or corporate\ngovernance matters, which (along with any\nresulting financial restatements) may\nadversely affect the guaranteeing entities.\nImportantly, the future of the entities is in\nserious question as the U.S. government\nreportedly is considering multiple options,\nranging from nationalization, privatization,\nconsolidation, or abolishment of the entities.\n\nU.S. REGISTERED SECURITIES OF FOREIGN ISSUERS\n\nInvesting in U.S. registered, dollar-\ndenominated, securities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers involves some risks and considerations\nnot typically associated with investing in\nU.S. companies. These include differences in\naccounting, auditing and financial reporting\nstandards, the possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations,\npolitical instability which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in foreign countries, and\npotential restrictions of the flow of\ninternational capital. Foreign companies may\nbe subject to less governmental regulation\nthan U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual\nforeign economies may differ favorably or\nunfavorably from the U.S. economy in such\nrespects as growth of gross domestic product,\nrate of inflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and balance of\npayment positions.\n\nVARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES\n\nVariable rate securities are instruments\nissued or guaranteed by entities such as (1)\nUS Government, or an agency or instrumentality\nthereof, (2) states, municipalities and other\npolitical subdivisions, agencies, authorities\nand instrumentalities or states and multi-\nstate agencies or authorities (3)\ncorporations, (4) financial institutions, (5)\ninsurance companies or (6) trusts that have a\nrate of interest subject to adjustment at\nregular intervals but less frequently than\nannually. A variable rate security provides\nfor the automatic establishment of a new\ninterest rate on set dates. Variable rate\nobligations whose interest is readjusted no\nless frequently than annually\n                      14                      \nwill be deemed to have a maturity equal to the\nperiod remaining until the next readjustment\nof the interest rate. The Fund may also\npurchase floating rate securities. A floating\nrate security provides for the automatic\nadjustment of its interest rate whenever a\nspecified interest rate changes. Interest\nrates on these securities are ordinarily tied\nto, and are a percentage of, a widely\nrecognized interest rate, such as the yield on\n90-day US Treasury bills or the prime rate of\na specified bank. These rates may change as\noften as twice daily. Generally, changes in\ninterest rates will have a smaller effect on\nthe market value of variable and fixed rate\nfloating rate securities than on the market\nvalue of comparable fixed rate fixed income\nobligations. Thus, investing in variable and\nfixed rate floating rate securities generally\nallows less opportunity for capital\nappreciation and depreciation than investing\nin comparable fixed rate fixed income\nsecurities.\n\nVARIABLE RATE DEMAND OBLIGATIONS\n\nVariable rate demand obligations (\u201cVRDOs\u201d) are\nshort-term tax-exempt fixed income instruments\nwhose yield is reset on a periodic basis. VRDO\nsecurities tend to be issued with long\nmaturities of up to 30 or 40 years; however,\nthey are considered short-term instruments\nbecause they include a put feature which\ncoincides with the periodic yield reset. For\nexample, a VRDO whose yield resets weekly will\nhave a put feature that is exercisable upon\nseven days\u2019 notice. VRDOs are put back to a\nbank or other entity that serves as a\nliquidity provider, who then tries to resell\nthe VRDOs or, if unable to resell, holds them\nin its own inventory. VRDOs are generally\nsupported by either a Letter of Credit or a\nStand-by Bond Purchase Agreement to provide\ncredit enhancement.\n                                              \n       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS       \n                                              \nA discussion of the risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. The discussion below supplements,\nand should be read in conjunction with, the\nProspectus.\n\nGENERAL\n\nInvestment in the Fund should be made with an\nunderstanding that the value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities may fluctuate in\naccordance with changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuers of the portfolio\nsecurities, the value of securities generally\nand other factors.\n\nAn investment in the Fund should also be made\nwith an understanding of the risks inherent in\nan investment in securities, including the\nrisk that the financial condition of issuers\nmay become impaired or that the general\ncondition of the securities markets may\ndeteriorate (either of which may cause a\ndecrease in the value of the portfolio\nsecurities and thus in the value of Shares).\nSecurities are susceptible to general market\nfluctuations and to volatile increases and\ndecreases in value as market confidence in and\nperceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic and banking\ncrises. Securities of issuers traded on\nexchanges may be suspended on certain\nexchanges by the issuers themselves, by an\nexchange or by government authorities. The\nlikelihood of such suspensions may be higher\nfor securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than in countries\nwith more developed markets. Trading\nsuspensions may be applied from time to time\nto the securities of individual issuers for\nreasons specific to that issuer, or may be\napplied broadly by exchanges or governmental\nauthorities in response to market events.\nSuspensions may last for significant periods\nof time, during which trading in the\nsecurities and instruments that reference the\nsecurities, such as participatory notes (or\n\u201cP-notes\u201d) or other derivative instruments,\nmay be halted.\n\nThe principal trading market for some of the\nsecurities in the Index may be in the over-\nthe-counter market. The existence of a liquid\ntrading market for certain securities may\ndepend on whether dealers will make a market\nin such securities. There can be no assurance\nthat a market will be made or maintained or\nthat any such market will be or remain liquid.\nThe price at which securities may be sold and\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s Shares will be\nadversely affected if trading markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities are limited or\nabsent or if bid/ask spreads are wide.\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK\n\nAn investment in the Fund may be subject to a\nnumber of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest. For example, the Adviser or its\naffiliates may provide services to the Fund,\nsuch as securities lending agency services,\ncustodial, administrative, bookkeeping, and\naccounting services, transfer agency and\nshareholder servicing, securities brokerage\nservices, and other services for which the\nFund would compensate the Adviser and/or such\naffiliates. The Fund may invest in other\npooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed,\nor otherwise affiliated with the Adviser.\nThere is no assurance that the rates at which\nthe Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser\nor its affiliates, or the terms on which it\nenters into transactions with the Adviser or\nits affiliates, will be the most favorable\navailable in the market generally or as\nfavorable as the rates the Adviser makes\navailable to other clients. Because of its\nfinancial interest, the Adviser may have an\nincentive to enter into transactions or\narrangements on behalf of the Fund with itself\nor its affiliates in circumstances where it\nmight not have done so in the absence of that\ninterest.\n                      15                      \nCONTINUOUS OFFERING\n\nThe method by which Creation Units of Shares\nare created and traded may raise certain\nissues under applicable securities laws.\nBecause new Creation Units of Shares are\nissued and sold by the Trust on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201cdistribution,\u201d as such\nterm is used in the Securities Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner which could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery and liability\nprovisions of the Securities Act.\n\nFor example, a broker-dealer firm or its\nclient may be deemed a statutory underwriter\nif it takes Creation Units after placing an\norder with the Distributor, breaks them down\ninto constituent Shares, and sells such Shares\ndirectly to customers, or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of a supply of new Shares\nwith an active selling effort involving\nsolicitation of secondary market demand for\nShares. A determination of whether one is an\nunderwriter for purposes of the Securities Act\nmust take into account all the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case, and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an underwriter.\n\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201cunderwriters\u201d but are\neffecting transactions in Shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nShares, are generally required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\nSecurities Act is not available in respect of\nsuch transactions as a result of Section 24(d)\nof the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a\nprospectus-delivery obligation with respect to\nShares of the Fund are reminded that under\nSecurities Act Rule 153, a prospectus-delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the\nSecurities Act owed to an exchange member in\nconnection with a sale on the Exchange is\nsatisfied by the fact that the Fund\u2019s\nProspectus is available at the Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism\nprovided in Rule 153 is only available with\nrespect to transactions on an exchange.\n\nSSGA or its affiliates (the \u201cSelling\nShareholder\u201d) may purchase Creation Units\nthrough a broker-dealer to \u201cseed\u201d (in whole or\nin part) the Fund as it is launched, or may\npurchase shares from broker-dealers or other\ninvestors that have previously provided \u201cseed\u201d\nfor the Fund when it was launched or otherwise\nin secondary market transactions, and because\nthe Selling Shareholder may be deemed an\naffiliate of the Fund, the Shares are being\nregistered to permit the resale of these\nshares from time to time after purchase. The\nFund will not receive any of the proceeds from\nthe resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese Shares.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder intends to sell all or\na portion of the Shares owned by it and\noffered hereby from time to time directly or\nthrough one or more broker-dealers, and may\nalso hedge such positions. The Shares may be\nsold on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the Shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, in the over-the-counter\nmarket or in transactions other than on these\nexchanges or systems at fixed prices, at\nprevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected in transactions, which may\ninvolve cross or block transactions.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder may also loan or\npledge Shares to broker-dealers that in turn\nmay sell such Shares, to the extent permitted\nby applicable law. The Selling Shareholder may\nalso enter into options or other transactions\nwith broker-dealers or other financial\ninstitutions or the creation of one or more\nderivative securities which require the\ndelivery to such broker-dealer or other\nfinancial institution of Shares, which Shares\nsuch broker-dealer or other financial\ninstitution may resell.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer\nor agents participating in the distribution of\nShares may be deemed to be \u201cunderwriters\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(11) of the\nSecurities Act in connection with such sales.\nIn such event, any commissions paid to any\nsuch broker-dealer or agent and any profit on\nthe resale of the Shares purchased by them may\nbe deemed to be underwriting commissions or\ndiscounts under the Securities Act. The\nSelling Shareholder who may be deemed an\n\u201cunderwriter\u201d within the meaning of Section\n2(11) of the Securities Act will be subject to\nthe applicable prospectus delivery\nrequirements of the Securities Act.\n\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK\n\nCounterparty risk with respect to derivatives\nhas been and may continue to be affected by\nnew rules and regulations affecting the\nderivatives market. Some derivatives\ntransactions are required to be centrally\ncleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives\ntransaction is subject to the credit risk of\nthe clearing house and the clearing member\nthrough which it holds its cleared position,\nrather than the credit risk of its original\ncounterparty to the derivatives transaction.\nCredit risk of market participants with\nrespect to derivatives that are centrally\ncleared is concentrated in a few clearing\nhouses, and it is not clear how an insolvency\nproceeding of a clearing house would be\nconducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by the\nFund, and what impact an insolvency of a\nclearing house would have on the financial\nsystem more generally.\n                      16                      \nFUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS\n\nThere can be no assurance that a liquid\nsecondary market will exist for any particular\nfutures contract or option at any specific\ntime. Thus, it may not be possible to close a\nfutures or options position. In the event of\nadverse price movements, the Fund would\ncontinue to be required to make daily cash\npayments to maintain its required margin. In\nsuch situations, if the Fund has insufficient\ncash, it may have to sell portfolio securities\nto meet daily margin requirements at a time\nwhen it may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, the Fund may be required to make\ndelivery of the instruments underlying futures\ncontracts it has sold.\n\nThe Fund will minimize the risk that it will\nbe unable to close out a futures or options\ncontract by only entering into futures and\noptions for which there appears to be a liquid\nsecondary market.\n\nThe risk of loss in trading futures contracts\nor uncovered call options in some strategies\n(e.g., selling uncovered index futures\ncontracts) is potentially unlimited. The Fund\ndoes not plan to use futures and options\ncontracts, when available, in this manner. The\nrisk of a futures position may still be large\nas traditionally measured due to the low\nmargin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, may utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit its risk exposure to that\nwhich is comparable to what it would have\nincurred through direct investment in\nsecurities.\n\nUtilization of futures transactions by the\nFund involves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to its benchmark Index if\nthe index underlying the futures contracts\ndiffers from the benchmark Index or if the\nfutures contracts do not track the benchmark\nIndex as expected. There is also the risk of\nloss by the Fund of margin deposits in the\nevent of bankruptcy of a broker with whom the\nFund has an open position in the futures\ncontract or option.\n\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit establishes the maximum amount\nthat the price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. The daily limit governs only price\nmovement during a particular trading day and\ntherefore does not limit potential losses,\nbecause the limit may prevent the liquidation\nof unfavorable positions. Futures contract\nprices have occasionally moved to the daily\nlimit for several consecutive trading days\nwith little or no trading, thereby preventing\nprompt liquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting some futures traders to substantial\nlosses.\n\nRISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nSwap agreements are subject to the risk that\nthe swap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, the\nFund will have contractual remedies pursuant\nto the agreements related to the transaction,\nbut such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy\nand insolvency laws which could affect the\nFund\u2019s rights as a creditor.\n\nThe use of interest-rate and index swaps is a\nhighly specialized activity that involves\ninvestment techniques and risks different from\nthose associated with ordinary portfolio\nsecurity transactions. The use of a swap\nrequires an understanding not only of the\nreferenced asset, reference rate or index but\nalso of the swap itself, without the benefit\nof observing the performance of the swap under\nall possible market conditions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets or principal.\n\nThe absence of a regulated execution facility\nor contract market and lack of liquidity for\nswap transactions has led, in some instances,\nto difficulties in trading and valuation,\nespecially in the event of market disruptions.\nUnder recently adopted rules and regulations,\ntransactions in some types of swaps are\nrequired to be centrally cleared. In a cleared\nderivatives transaction, the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty to the transaction is a central\nderivatives clearing organization, or clearing\nhouse, rather than a bank or broker. Because\nthe Fund is not a member of a clearing house,\nand only members of a clearing house can\nparticipate directly in the clearing house,\nthe Fund holds cleared derivatives through\naccounts at clearing members. In cleared\nderivatives transactions, the Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and\nreceive payments from a clearing house through\nits accounts at clearing members. Clearing\nmembers guarantee performance of their\nclients\u2019 obligations to the clearing house.\nCentrally cleared derivative arrangements may\nbe less favorable to the Fund than bilateral\n(non-cleared) arrangements. For example, the\nFund may be required to provide greater\namounts of margin for cleared derivatives\ntransactions than for bilateral derivatives\ntransactions. Also, in contrast to bilateral\nderivatives transactions, in some cases\nfollowing a period of notice to the Fund, a\nclearing member generally can require\ntermination of existing cleared derivatives\ntransactions at any time or an increase in\nmargin requirements above the margin that the\nclearing member required at the beginning of a\ntransaction. Clearing houses also have broad\nrights to increase margin requirements for\nexisting transactions or to terminate\ntransactions at any time. The Fund is subject\nto risk if it enters into a derivatives\ntransaction that is required to be cleared (or\nwhich SSGA FM expects to be cleared), and no\nclearing member is willing or able to clear\nthe transaction on the Fund\u2019s behalf. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of the transaction,\nincluding loss of an increase in the value of\nthe transaction and loss of hedging\nprotection. In addition, the documentation\ngoverning the relationship between the Fund\nand clearing members is drafted by the\nclearing members and generally is less\nfavorable to the Fund than typical bilateral\nderivatives documentation.\n                      17                      \nThese clearing rules and other new rules and\nregulations could, among other things,\nrestrict the Fund\u2019s ability to engage in, or\nincrease the cost to the Fund of, derivatives\ntransactions, for example, by making some\ntypes of derivatives no longer available to\nthe Fund, increasing margin or capital\nrequirements, or otherwise limiting liquidity\nor increasing transaction costs. These\nregulations are new and evolving, so their\npotential impact on the Fund and the financial\nsystem are not yet known.\n\nBecause they are two party contracts that may\nbe subject to contractual restrictions on\ntransferability and termination and because\nthey may have terms of greater than seven\ndays, swap agreements may be considered to be\nilliquid and subject to the Fund\u2019s limitation\non investments in illiquid investments. To the\nextent that a swap is not liquid, it may not\nbe possible to initiate a transaction or\nliquidate a position at an advantageous time\nor price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Like most other investments, swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nmarket value of the instrument will change in\na way detrimental to the Fund\u2019s interest.\n\nIf the Fund uses a swap as a hedge against, or\nas a substitute for, a portfolio investment,\nthe Fund will be exposed to the risk that the\nswap will have or will develop imperfect or no\ncorrelation with the portfolio investment.\nThis could cause substantial losses for the\nFund. While hedging strategies involving swap\ninstruments can reduce the risk of loss, they\ncan also reduce the opportunity for gain or\neven result in losses by offsetting favorable\nprice movements in other Fund investments.\nMany swaps are complex and often valued\nsubjectively.\n\nEUROPE \u2013 RECENT EVENTS\n\nA number of countries in Europe, including\nGreece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal,\nhave experienced rising government debt\nlevels. The concern over these debt levels has\nled to volatility in the European financial\nmarkets, which has adversely affected the\nexchange rate of the euro and may continue to\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe.\nFor some countries, the ability to repay\nsovereign debt is in question, and default is\npossible, which could affect their ability to\nborrow in the future. Several countries have\nagreed to multi-year bailout loans from the\nEuropean Central Bank, the IMF, and other\ninstitutions. A default or debt restructuring\nby any European country can adversely impact\nholders of that country\u2019s debt and can affect\nexposures to other European Union (\u201cEU\u201d)\ncountries and their financial companies as\nwell. These financial difficulties may\ncontinue, worsen or spread within or outside\nEurope. Responses to the financial problems by\nEuropean governments, central banks and\nothers, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not work, may result in social\nunrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended\nconsequences.\n\nUncertainties regarding the viability of the\nEU have impacted and may continue to impact\nmarkets in the United States and around the\nworld. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom\nformally withdrew from the EU (commonly\nreferred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and entered an\n11-month transition period. The transition\nperiod concluded on December 31, 2020, and the\nUnited Kingdom left the EU single market and\ncustoms union under the terms of a new trade\nagreement. The agreement governs the new\nrelationship between the United Kingdom and EU\nwith respect to trading goods and services,\nbut critical aspects of the relationship\nremain unresolved and subject to further\nnegotiation and agreement. The full scope and\nnature of the consequences of the exit are not\nat this time known and are unlikely to be\nknown for a significant period of time. It is\nalso unknown whether the United Kingdom\u2019s exit\nwill increase the likelihood of other\ncountries also departing the EU. Any\nadditional exits from the EU, or the\npossibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments.\n\nLIBOR RISK\n\nInstruments or contracts in which the Fund\ninvests may pay interest at floating or\nadjusting rates based on LIBOR or may be\nsubject to interest caps or floors tied to\nLIBOR. LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S.\nand globally as a benchmark or reference rate\nfor various commercial and financial\ncontracts, including corporate and municipal\nbonds, bank loans, asset-backed and mortgage-\nrelated securities, interest rate swaps and\nother derivatives.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA), which\nregulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021, it\nwould cease its active encouragement of banks\nto provide quotations needed to sustain the\nLIBOR rate. On March 5, 2021, the\nadministrator of LIBOR announced a delay in\nthe phase out of the majority of the USD LIBOR\npublications until June 30, 2023, while the\nremainder of USD LIBOR publications ceased on\nDecember 31, 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve,\nin conjunction with the Alternative Reference\nRates Committee, a steering committee\ncomprised of large U.S. financial\ninstitutions, has identified the Secured\nOvernight Financial Rate (SOFR) as the\npreferred alternative rate to LIBOR. SOFR is a\nrelatively new index calculated by short-term\nrepurchase agreements, backed by Treasury\nsecurities.\n                      18                      \nWhile some instruments or contracts may\ncontemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no\nlonger available by providing for an\nalternative rate setting methodology, not all\ninstruments or contracts may have such\n\u201cfallback provisions.\u201d Abandonment of or\nmodifications to LIBOR could lead to\nsignificant short-term and long-term\nuncertainty and market instability and the\nextent to which that may impact the Fund may\nvary depending on various factors, which\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) existing\nfallback or termination provisions in\nindividual contracts and (ii) whether, how,\nand when industry participants develop and\nadopt new successor reference rates and/or\nfallbacks for both legacy and new instruments\nor contracts. To address the potential risks\nand uncertainty associated with instruments or\ncontracts containing no fallback provisions,\nin March 2022, the Biden administration\nenacted legislation that provides a uniform\nnational approach for replacing USD LIBOR. In\ninstances where a contract or instrument does\nnot contain an effective fallback provision,\nthe USD LIBOR rate will be replaced by a rate\nbased on SOFR that is selected by the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe transition to a successor rate may result\nin (i) increased volatility or illiquidity in\nmarkets for instruments or contracts that\ncurrently rely on LIBOR, (ii) a reduction in\nthe value of certain instruments or contracts\nheld by the Fund, (iii) reduced effectiveness\nof related Fund transactions, such as hedging,\n(iv) additional tax, accounting and regulatory\nrisks, or (v) costs incurred in connection\nwith closing out positions and entering into\nnew trades. Any pricing adjustments to the\nFund\u2019s investments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s performance and/or NAV. Additionally,\nif LIBOR ultimately ceases to exist, the Fund\nmay need to renegotiate the credit agreements\nextending beyond the LIBOR phase out date with\nthe Fund\u2019s obligors that utilize LIBOR as a\nfactor in determining the interest rate and\ncertain of the Fund\u2019s existing credit\nfacilities to replace LIBOR with a new rate.\nAny pricing adjustments to the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s performance and/or NAV. There is no\nassurance that the composition or\ncharacteristics of any such alternative\nreference rate will be similar to or produce\nthe same value or economic equivalence as\nLIBOR or that instruments or contracts using\nan alternative rate will have the same volume\nor liquidity.\n\nMARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING FROM COVID-19\n\nAn outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by\na novel coronavirus first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has spread globally. In an\norganized attempt to contain and mitigate the\neffects of the spread of the coronavirus known\nas COVID-19, governments and businesses world-\nwide have taken aggressive measures, including\nclosing borders, restricting international and\ndomestic travel, and the imposition of\nprolonged quarantines of large populations.\nCOVID-19 has resulted in the disruption of and\ndelays in the delivery of healthcare services\nand processes, the cancellation of organized\nevents and educational institutions, the\ndisruption of production and supply chains, a\ndecline in consumer demand for certain goods\nand services, and general concern and\nuncertainty, all of which have contributed to\nincreased volatility in global markets. The\neffects of COVID-19 will likely affect certain\nsectors and industries more dramatically than\nothers, which may adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investments in those sectors or\nindustries. COVID-19, and other epidemics and\npandemics that may arise in the future, could\nadversely affect the economies of many\nnations, the global economy, individual\ncompanies and capital markets in ways that\ncannot be foreseen at the present time. In\naddition, the impact of infectious diseases in\ndeveloping or emerging market countries may be\ngreater due to limited health care resources.\nPolitical, economic and social stresses caused\nby COVID-19 also may exacerbate other pre-\nexisting political, social and economic risks\nin certain countries. The duration of COVID-19\nand its effects cannot be determined at this\ntime, but the effects could be present for an\nextended period of time.\n\nRUSSIA SANCTIONS RISK\n\nSanctions threatened or imposed by a number of\njurisdictions, including the United States,\nthe European Union and the United Kingdom, and\nother intergovernmental actions that have been\nor may be undertaken in the future, against\nRussia, Russian entities or Russian\nindividuals, may result in the devaluation of\nRussian currency, a downgrade in the country\u2019s\ncredit rating, an immediate freeze of Russian\nassets, a decline in the value and liquidity\nof Russian securities, property or interests,\nand/or other adverse consequences to the\nRussian economy or the Fund. The scope and\nscale of sanctions in place at a particular\ntime may be expanded or otherwise modified in\na way that have negative effects on the Fund.\nSanctions, or the threat of new or modified\nsanctions, could impair the ability of the\nFund to buy, sell, hold, receive, deliver or\notherwise transact in certain affected\nsecurities or other investment instruments.\nSanctions could also result in Russia taking\ncounter measures or other actions in response,\nwhich may further impair the value and\nliquidity of Russian securities. These\nsanctions, and the resulting disruption of the\nRussian economy, may cause volatility in other\nregional and global markets and may negatively\nimpact the performance of various sectors and\nindustries, as well as companies in other\ncountries, which could have a negative effect\non the performance of the Fund, even if the\nFund does not have direct exposure to\nsecurities of Russian issuers. As a collective\nresult of the imposition of sanctions, Russian\ngovernment countermeasures and the impact that\nthey have had on the trading markets for\nRussian securities, the Fund may use fair\nvaluation procedures approved by the Fund\u2019s\nBoard to value certain Russian securities,\nwhich could result in such securities being\ndeemed to have a zero value.\n\nA reduction in liquidity of certain Fund\nholdings as a result of sanctions and related\nactions may cause the Fund to experience\nincreased premiums or discounts to its NAV\nand/or wider bid-ask spreads. Additionally, if\nit becomes impracticable or unlawful for\n                      19                      \nthe Fund to hold securities subject to, or\notherwise affected by, sanctions, or if deemed\nappropriate by the Fund\u2019s investment adviser,\nthe Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the\naffected securities in connection with\ncreation transactions and instead require a\ncash deposit, which may also increase the\nFund\u2019s transaction costs.\n\nTAX RISKS\n\nAs with any investment, you should consider\nhow your investment in Shares of the Fund will\nbe taxed. The tax information in the\nProspectus and this SAI is provided as general\ninformation. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in Shares of the Fund.\n\nUnless your investment in Shares is made\nthrough a tax-exempt entity or tax-advantaged\nretirement account, such as an individual\nretirement account, you need to be aware of\nthe possible tax consequences when the Fund\nmakes distributions or you sell Shares.\n                                              \n           INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS            \n                                              \nThe Trust has adopted the following investment\nrestrictions as fundamental policies with\nrespect to the Fund. These restrictions cannot\nbe changed without the approval of the holders\nof a majority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. For purposes of the 1940 Act, a\nmajority of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund means the vote, at an annual or a\nspecial meeting of the security holders of the\nTrust, of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the\nvoting securities of the Fund present at such\nmeeting, if the holders of more than 50% of\nthe outstanding voting securities of the Fund\nare present or represented by proxy, or (2)\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund. Except with the\napproval of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities, the Fund may not:\n\n1. Concentrate its investments in securities\nof issuers in the same industry, except as may\nbe necessary to approximate the composition of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying Index;\n\n2. Make loans to another person except as\npermitted by the 1940 Act or other governing\nstatute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the\nSEC or other regulatory agency with authority\nover the Fund;\n\n3. Issue senior securities or borrow money\nexcept as permitted by the 1940 Act or other\ngoverning statute, by the Rules thereunder, or\nby the SEC or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund;\n\n4. Invest directly in real estate unless the\nreal estate is acquired as a result of\nownership of securities or other instruments.\nThis restriction shall not preclude the Fund\nfrom investing in companies that deal in real\nestate or in instruments that are backed or\nsecured by real estate;\n\n5. Act as an underwriter of another issuer\u2019s\nsecurities, except to the extent the Fund may\nbe deemed to be an underwriter within the\nmeaning of the Securities Act in connection\nwith the Fund\u2019s purchase and sale of portfolio\nsecurities; or\n\n6. Invest in commodities except as permitted\nby the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other\nregulatory agency with authority over the\nFund.\n\nIn addition to the investment restrictions\nadopted as fundamental policies as set forth\nabove, the Fund observes the following\nrestrictions, which may be changed by the\nBoard without a shareholder vote. The Fund\nwill not:\n\n1. Invest in the securities of a company for\nthe purpose of exercising management or\ncontrol, provided that the Trust may vote the\ninvestment securities owned by the Fund in\naccordance with its views;\n\n2. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its total assets in securities\nthat comprise the benchmark Index. Securities\nthat have economic characteristics\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index are included within this\n80% investment policy; and\n\n3. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of\nborrowings for investment purposes, in\ninvestment grade corporate bonds. Prior to any\nchange in this 80% investment policy, the Fund\nwill provide shareholders with 60 days\u2019\nwritten notice.\n                                              \n     The SEC Staff considers concentration    \n  1  to involve more than 25% of a fund\u2019s     \n     assets to be invested in an industry or  \n     group of industries.                     \n                                              \n                      20                      \nThe Fund defines the foregoing terms in\naccordance with the definition of such terms\nper the Index. If a percentage limitation is\nadhered to at the time of investment or\ncontract, a later increase or decrease in\npercentage resulting from any change in value\nor total or net assets will not result in a\nviolation of such restriction, except that the\npercentage limitations with respect to the\nborrowing of money will be observed\ncontinuously. With respect to the limitation\non borrowing, in the event that a subsequent\nchange in net assets or other circumstances\ncause the Fund to exceed its limitation, the\nFund will take steps to bring the aggregate\namount of borrowing back within the\nlimitations within three days thereafter (not\nincluding Sundays and holidays).\n\nThe 1940 Act currently permits the Fund to\nloan up to 33 1/3% of its total assets. With\nrespect to borrowing, the 1940 Act presently\nallows the Fund to: (1) borrow from any bank\n(including pledging, mortgaging or\nhypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 /%\nof its total assets, (2) borrow money for\ntemporary purposes in an amount not exceeding\n5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets at\nthe time of the loan, and (3) enter into\nreverse repurchase agreements. However, under\nnormal circumstances any borrowings by the\nFund will not exceed 10% of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets. The 1940 Act generally prohibits funds\nfrom issuing senior securities, although it\ndoes not treat certain transactions as senior\nsecurities, such as certain borrowings, short\nsales, reverse repurchase agreements, firm\ncommitment agreements and standby commitments,\nwith appropriate earmarking or segregation of\nassets to cover such obligation. With respect\nto investments in commodities, the 1940 Act\npresently permits the Fund to invest in\ncommodities in accordance with investment\npolicies contained in its prospectus and SAI.\nAny such investment shall also comply with the\nCEA and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe 1940 Act does not directly restrict an\ninvestment company\u2019s ability to invest in real\nestate, but does require that every investment\ncompany have the fundamental investment policy\ngoverning such investments. The Fund will not\npurchase or sell real estate, except that the\nFund may invest in companies that deal in real\nestate (including real estate investment\ntrusts (\u201cREITs\u201d)) or in instruments that are\nbacked or secured by real estate.\n                                              \n         EXCHANGE LISTING AND TRADING         \n                                              \nA discussion of exchange listing and trading\nmatters associated with an investment in the\nFund is contained in the Prospectus under\n\u201cPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION\u201d and\n\u201cADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION.\u201d\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, such sections of\nthe Prospectus.\n\nThe Shares of the Fund are approved for\nlisting and trading on the Exchange, subject\nto notice of issuance. Shares trade on the\nExchange at prices that may differ to some\ndegree from their net asset value. There can\nbe no assurance that the requirements of the\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nShares of the Fund will continue to be met.\n\nThe Exchange may consider the suspension of\ntrading in, and may initiate delisting\nproceedings of, the Shares of the Fund under\nany of the following circumstances: (i) if the\nExchange becomes aware that the Fund is no\nlonger eligible to operate in reliance on Rule\n6c-11 under the 1940 Act; (ii) if the Fund no\nlonger complies with the applicable listing\nrequirements set forth in the Exchange\u2019s\nrules; (iii) if, following the initial twelve-\nmonth period after commencement of trading on\nthe Exchange of the Fund, there are fewer than\n50 beneficial holders of the Fund; or (iv) if\nsuch other event shall occur or condition\nexists which, in the opinion of the Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Exchange\ninadvisable. The Exchange will remove the\nShares from listing and trading upon\ntermination of the Fund.\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nShare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor\u2019s\nequity interest in the Fund.\n\nAs in the case of other publicly traded\nsecurities, brokers\u2019 commissions on\ntransactions will be based on negotiated\ncommission rates at customary levels.\n\nThe base and trading currencies of the Fund is\nthe U.S. dollar. The base currency is the\ncurrency in which the Fund\u2019s net asset value\nper Share is calculated and the trading\ncurrency is the currency in which Shares of\nthe Fund are listed and traded on the\nExchange.\n                                              \n           MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST            \n                                              \nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u201cMANAGEMENT.\u201d\n\nBoard Responsibilities. The management and\naffairs of the Trust and its series, including\nthe Fund described in this SAI, are overseen\nby the Trustees. The Board has approved\ncontracts, as described in this SAI, under\nwhich certain companies provide essential\nmanagement services to the Trust.\n                      21                      \nLike most mutual funds, the day-to-day\nbusiness of the Trust, including the\nmanagement of risk, is performed by third\nparty service providers, such as the Adviser,\nDistributor, Administrator and Sub-\nAdministrator. The Trustees are responsible\nfor overseeing the Trust\u2019s service providers\nand, thus, have oversight responsibility with\nrespect to risk management performed by those\nservice providers. Risk management seeks to\nidentify and address risks, i.e., events or\ncircumstances that could have material adverse\neffects on the business, operations,\nshareholder services, investment performance\nor reputation of the Fund. The Fund and its\nservice providers employ a variety of\nprocesses, procedures and controls to identify\nvarious of those possible events or\ncircumstances, to lessen the probability of\ntheir occurrence and/or to mitigate the\neffects of such events or circumstances if\nthey do occur. Each service provider is\nresponsible for one or more discrete aspects\nof the Trust\u2019s business and, consequently, for\nmanaging the risks associated with that\nbusiness. The Board has emphasized to the\nFund\u2019s service providers the importance of\nmaintaining vigorous risk management.\n\nThe Trustees\u2019 role in risk oversight begins\nbefore the inception of the Fund, at which\ntime the Fund\u2019s Adviser presents the Board\nwith information concerning the investment\nobjectives, strategies and risks of the Fund,\nas well as proposed investment limitations for\nthe Fund. Additionally, the Fund\u2019s Adviser\nprovides the Board with an overview of, among\nother things, their investment philosophies,\nbrokerage practices and compliance\ninfrastructures. Thereafter, the Board\ncontinues its oversight function as various\npersonnel, including the Trust\u2019s Chief\nCompliance Officer, as well as personnel of\nthe Adviser and other service providers, such\nas the Fund\u2019s independent accountants, make\nperiodic reports to the Audit Committee or to\nthe Board with respect to various aspects of\nrisk management. The Board and the Audit\nCommittee oversee efforts by management and\nservice providers to manage risks to which the\nFund may be exposed.\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the\nnature, extent and quality of the services\nprovided to the Fund by the Adviser and\nreceives information about those services at\nits regular meetings. In addition, on an\nannual basis, in connection with its\nconsideration of whether to renew the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with the\nAdviser, the Board meets with the Adviser to\nreview such services. Among other things, the\nBoard regularly considers the Adviser\u2019s\nadherence to the Fund\u2019s investment\nrestrictions and compliance with various Fund\npolicies and procedures and with applicable\nsecurities regulations. The Board also reviews\ninformation about the Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nThe Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer reports\nregularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance issues. At least annually, the\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer provides the\nBoard with a report reviewing the adequacy and\neffectiveness of the Trust\u2019s policies and\nprocedures and those of its service providers,\nincluding the Adviser. The report addresses\nthe operation of the policies and procedures\nof the Trust and each service provider since\nthe date of the last report; any material\nchanges to the policies and procedures since\nthe date of the last report; any\nrecommendations for material changes to the\npolicies and procedures; and any material\ncompliance matters since the date of the last\nreport.\n\nThe Board receives reports from the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers regarding operational risks\nand risks related to the valuation and\nliquidity of portfolio securities. Regular\nreports are made to the Board concerning\ninvestments for which market quotations are\nnot readily available. Annually, the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nreviews with the Audit Committee its audit of\nthe Fund\u2019s financial statements, focusing on\nmajor areas of risk encountered by the Fund\nand noting any significant deficiencies or\nmaterial weaknesses in the Fund\u2019s internal\ncontrols. Additionally, in connection with its\noversight function, the Board oversees Fund\nmanagement\u2019s implementation of disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, which are designed to\nensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports\nwith the SEC are recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the required\ntime periods. The Board also oversees the\nTrust\u2019s internal controls over financial\nreporting, which comprise policies and\nprocedures designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the\nTrust\u2019s financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Trust\u2019s financial\nstatements.\n\nFrom their review of these reports and\ndiscussions with the Adviser, the Chief\nCompliance Officer, the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and other service\nproviders, the Board and the Audit Committee\nlearn in detail about the material risks of\nthe Fund, thereby facilitating a dialogue\nabout how management and service providers\nidentify and mitigate those risks.\n\nThe Board recognizes that not all risks that\nmay affect the Fund can be identified and/or\nquantified, that it may not be practical or\ncost-effective to eliminate or mitigate\ncertain risks, that it may be necessary to\nbear certain risks (such as investment-related\nrisks) to achieve the Fund\u2019s goals, and that\nthe processes, procedures and controls\nemployed to address certain risks may be\nlimited in their effectiveness. Moreover,\nreports received by the Trustees as to risk\nmanagement matters are typically summaries of\nthe relevant information. Most of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment management and business affairs are\ncarried out by or through the Fund\u2019s Adviser\nand other service providers, each of which has\nan independent interest in risk management but\nwhose policies and the methods by which one or\nmore risk management functions are carried out\nmay differ from the Fund\u2019s and each other\u2019s in\nthe setting of priorities, the resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. As a result of the foregoing and\nother factors, the Board\u2019s ability to monitor\nand manage risk, as a practical matter, is\nsubject to limitations.\n                      22                      \nTrustees and Officers. There are five members\nof the Board of Trustees, four of whom are not\ninterested persons of the Trust, as that term\nis defined in the 1940 Act (\u201cIndependent\nTrustees\u201d). Carl Verboncoeur, an Independent\nTrustee, serves as Chairman of the Board. The\nBoard has determined its leadership structure\nis appropriate given the specific\ncharacteristics and circumstances of the\nTrust. The Board made this determination in\nconsideration of, among other things, the fact\nthat the Independent Trustees constitute a\nsuper-majority (greater than 75%) of the\nBoard, the fact that the chairperson of each\nCommittee of the Board is an Independent\nTrustee, the amount of assets under management\nin the Trust, and the number of funds overseen\nby the Board. The Board also believes that its\nleadership structure facilitates the orderly\nand efficient flow of information to the\nIndependent Trustees from fund management.\n\nThe Board of Trustees has two standing\ncommittees: the Audit Committee and Trustee\nCommittee. The Audit Committee and Trustee\nCommittee are each chaired by an Independent\nTrustee and composed of all of the Independent\nTrustees.\n\nSet forth below are the names, year of birth,\nposition with the Trust, length of term of\noffice, and the principal occupations during\nthe last five years and other directorships\nheld of each of the persons currently serving\nas a Trustee or Officer of the Trust.\n\nTRUSTEES\n                                              \n                                 NU\u2026    OTH\u2026  \n                 TERM             OF    DIR\u2026  \n  NA\u2026            OF      PRI\u2026    PO\u2026    HELD  \n  AD\u2026    POS\u2026    OFF\u2026    OCC\u2026     IN    BY    \n  AND    WITH    AND     DUR\u2026    FU\u2026    TRU\u2026  \n  YE\u2026    FUND    LEN\u2026    PAST    CO\u2026    DUR\u2026  \n  OF\u00a0            OF      5       OV\u2026    THE   \n  BI\u2026            TIME    YEA\u2026     BY    PAST  \n                 SER\u2026            TR\u2026    5\u00a0    \n                                        YEA\u2026  \n  IN\u2026                                         \n  TR\u2026                                         \n  CA\u2026                                         \n  G.                                          \n  VE\u2026                                         \n  c/o                                         \n  SP\u2026    Ind\u2026    Ter\u2026                   The   \n  Se\u2026    Tru\u2026    Unl\u2026    Sel\u2026           Mot\u2026  \n  Tr\u2026    Cha\u2026    Ser\u2026    con\u2026    125    Fool  \n  One    Tru\u2026    sin\u2026    sin\u2026           Fun\u2026  \n  Ir\u2026    Com\u2026    Apr\u2026    200\u2026           Tru\u2026  \n  St\u2026    Cha\u2026    2010                   (Tr\u2026  \n  Bo\u2026                                         \n  MA                                          \n  02\u2026                                         \n  19\u2026                                         \n  DW\u2026                    Sel\u2026                 \n  D.                     con\u2026                 \n  CH\u2026                    sin\u2026           Aff\u2026  \n  c/o                    201\u2026           Man\u2026  \n  SP\u2026    Ind\u2026    Ter\u2026    CEO            Gro\u2026  \n  Se\u2026    Tru\u2026    Unl\u2026    and            Inc.  \n  Tr\u2026    Aud\u2026    Ser\u2026    Pre\u2026    125    (Ch\u2026  \n  One    Com\u2026    sin\u2026    CFA            Dir\u2026  \n  Ir\u2026    Cha\u2026    Apr\u2026    Ins\u2026           and   \n  St\u2026            2010    (Ju\u2026           Aud\u2026  \n  Bo\u2026                    2014           Com\u2026  \n  MA                     \u2013              Cha\u2026  \n  02\u2026                    Jan\u2026                 \n  19\u2026                    201\u2026                 \n                                              \n                      23                      \n                                              \n                                 NU\u2026    OTH\u2026  \n                 TERM             OF    DIR\u2026  \n  NA\u2026            OF      PRI\u2026    PO\u2026    HELD  \n  AD\u2026    POS\u2026    OFF\u2026    OCC\u2026     IN    BY    \n  AND    WITH    AND     DUR\u2026    FU\u2026    TRU\u2026  \n  YE\u2026    FUND    LEN\u2026    PAST    CO\u2026    DUR\u2026  \n  OF\u00a0            OF      5       OV\u2026    THE   \n  BI\u2026            TIME    YEA\u2026     BY    PAST  \n                 SER\u2026            TR\u2026    5\u00a0    \n                                        YEA\u2026  \n                                        Pri\u2026  \n                                        Fin\u2026  \n                                        Gro\u2026  \n                                        (Di\u2026  \n                                        Bain  \n                                        Cap\u2026  \n                                        Spe\u2026  \n                                        Fin\u2026  \n                                        (Di\u2026  \n                                        Put\u2026  \n                                        Acq\u2026  \n  CL\u2026                                   Fin\u2026  \n  S.

Each Code of Ethics\npermits personnel, subject to that Code of\nEthics, to invest in securities for their\npersonal investment accounts, subject to\ncertain limitations, including securities that\nmay be purchased or held by the Fund.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Codes of\nEthics will be effective in preventing such\nactivities. Each Code of Ethics, filed as\nexhibits to this registration statement, may\nbe examined at the office of the SEC in\nWashington, D.C. or on the Internet at the\nSEC\u2019s website at https://www.sec.gov.\n\nPROXY VOTING POLICIES\n\nThe Board believes that the voting of proxies\non securities held by the Fund is an important\nelement of the overall investment process. As\nsuch, the Board has delegated the\nresponsibility to vote such proxies to the\nAdviser. Each of the Trust\u2019s and the Adviser\u2019s\nproxy voting policies are attached at the end\nof this SAI. Information regarding how the\nFund voted proxies relating to its portfolio\nsecurities during the most recent twelve-month\nperiod ended June 30 is available: (1) without\ncharge by calling 1-866-787-2257; (2) on the\nFund\u2019s website at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs;\nand (3) on the SEC\u2019s website at\nhttps://www.sec.gov.\n                      31                      \nDISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS POLICY\n\nThe Trust has adopted a policy regarding the\ndisclosure of information about the Trust\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. The Board must approve all\nmaterial amendments to this policy. The Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings are publicly disseminated\neach day the Fund is open for business through\nfinancial reporting and news services\nincluding publicly accessible Internet web\nsites. In addition, a basket composition file,\nwhich includes the security names and share\nquantities to deliver in exchange for Shares,\ntogether with estimates and actual cash\ncomponents, is publicly disseminated daily\nprior to the opening of the Exchange via the\nNational Securities Clearing Corporation\n(\u201cNSCC\u201d). The basket represents one Creation\nUnit of the Fund. The Trust, the Adviser or\nState Street will not disseminate non-public\ninformation concerning the Trust, except\ninformation may be made available prior to its\npublic availability: (i) to a party for a\nlegitimate business purpose related to the\nday-to-day operations of the Fund, including\n(a) a service provider, (b) the stock\nexchanges upon which the ETF is listed, (c)\nthe NSCC, (d) the Depository Trust Company,\nand (e) financial data/research companies such\nas Morningstar, Bloomberg L.P., and Reuters,\nor (ii) to any other party for a legitimate\nbusiness or regulatory purpose, upon waiver or\nexception, with the consent of an applicable\nTrust officer.\n                                              \n    INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES    \n                                              \nTHE INVESTMENT ADVISER\n\nSSGA FM acts as investment adviser to the\nTrust and, subject to the oversight of the\nBoard, is responsible for the investment\nmanagement of the Fund. As of December 31,\n2021, the Adviser managed approximately\n$841.33 billion in assets. The Adviser\u2019s\nprincipal address is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. The Adviser, a\nMassachusetts corporation, is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Global Advisors,\nInc., which is itself a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Corporation, a\npublicly held financial holding company. State\nStreet Global Advisors (\u201cSSGA\u201d), consisting of\nthe Adviser and other investment advisory\naffiliates of State Street Corporation, is the\ninvestment management arm of State Street\nCorporation.\n\nThe Adviser serves as investment adviser to\nthe Fund pursuant to an investment advisory\nagreement (\u201cInvestment Advisory Agreement\u201d)\nbetween the Trust and the Adviser. The\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, with respect to\nthe Fund, continues in effect for two years\nfrom its effective date, and thereafter is\nsubject to annual approval by (1) the Board or\n(2) vote of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)\nof the Fund, provided that in either event\nsuch continuance also is approved by a\nmajority of the Board who are not interested\npersons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nTrust by a vote cast in person at a meeting\ncalled for the purpose of voting on such\napproval. The Investment Advisory Agreement\nwith respect to the Fund is terminable without\npenalty, on 60 days\u2019 notice, by the Board or\nby a vote of the holders of a majority (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities. The Investment\nAdvisory Agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays\u2019 notice by the Adviser and will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined in the 1940 Act).\n\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, the\nAdviser, subject to the oversight of the Board\nand in conformity with the stated investment\npolicies of the Fund, manages the investment\nof the Fund\u2019s assets. The Adviser is\nresponsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the Investment Advisory Agreement, the\nAdviser is not liable for certain liabilities,\nincluding certain liabilities arising under\nthe federal securities laws, unless such loss\nor liability results from willful misfeasance,\nbad faith or gross negligence in the\nperformance of its duties or the reckless\ndisregard of its obligations and duties.\n\nFor the services provided to the Fund under\nthe Investment Advisory Agreement, the Fund\npays the Adviser monthly fees based on a\npercentage of the Fund\u2019s average daily net\nassets as set forth in the Fund\u2019s Prospectus.\nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all\nor a portion of its fee. The Adviser pays all\nexpenses of the Fund other than the management\nfee, brokerage, taxes, interest, fees and\nexpenses of the Independent Trustees\n(including any Trustee\u2019s counsel fees),\nacquired fund fees and expenses, litigation\nexpenses and other extraordinary expenses.\n\nThe Adviser has contractually agreed to waive\na portion of its management fee and/or\nreimburse certain expenses, until May 11,\n2023, so that the net annual Fund operating\nexpenses, before application of any fees and\nexpenses not paid by the Adviser pursuant to\nthe Investment Advisory Agreement, if any,\nwill be limited to 0.07% of the Fund\u2019s average\ndaily net assets. The Adviser has also\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fee and/or reimburse expenses in an\namount equal to any acquired fund fees and\nexpenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds\nfor cash management purposes, if any) for the\nFund until October 31, 2022. Neither\ncontractual fee waiver and/or reimbursement\nprovides for the recoupment by the Adviser of\nany fees the Adviser previously waived. The\nAdviser may continue each waiver and/or\nreimbursement from year to year, but there is\nno guarantee that the Adviser will do so and\neach waiver and/or reimbursement may be\ncancelled or modified at any time after the\nend of its current term.

The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management of the Fund are David\nMarchetti, Frank Miethe and Bradley Sullivan.\nThe following table lists the number and types\nof accounts managed by each of the key\nprofessionals involved in the day-to-day\nportfolio management for the Fund and assets\nunder management in those accounts.

Those\nconflicts could include preferential treatment\nof one account over others in terms of: (a)\nthe portfolio manager\u2019s execution of different\ninvestment strategies for various accounts or\n(b) the allocation of resources or of\ninvestment opportunities.\n\nPortfolio managers may manage numerous\naccounts for multiple clients. These accounts\nmay include registered investment companies,\nother types of pooled accounts (e.g.,\ncollective investment funds), and separate\naccounts (i.e., accounts managed on behalf of\nindividuals or public or private\ninstitutions). Portfolio managers make\ninvestment decisions for each account based on\nthe investment objectives and policies and\nother relevant investment considerations\napplicable to that portfolio.\n\nA potential conflict of interest may arise as\na result of the portfolio managers\u2019\nresponsibility for multiple accounts with\nsimilar investment guidelines. Under these\ncircumstances, a potential investment may be\nsuitable for more than one of the portfolio\nmanagers\u2019 accounts, but the quantity of the\ninvestment available for purchase is less than\nthe aggregate amount the accounts would\nideally devote to the opportunity. Similar\nconflicts may arise when multiple accounts\nseek to dispose of the same investment. The\nportfolio managers may also manage accounts\nwhose objectives and policies differ from that\nof the Fund. These differences may be such\nthat under certain circumstances, trading\nactivity appropriate for one account managed\nby the portfolio manager may have adverse\nconsequences for another account managed by\nthe portfolio manager. For example, an account\nmay sell a significant position in a security,\nwhich could cause the market price of that\nsecurity to decrease, while the Fund\nmaintained its position in that security.\n\nA potential conflict may arise when the\nportfolio managers are responsible for\naccounts that have different advisory fees\u2014the\ndifference in fees could create an incentive\nfor the portfolio manager to favor one account\nover another, for example, in terms of access\nto investment opportunities. Another potential\nconflict may arise when the portfolio manager\nhas an investment in one or more accounts that\nparticipate in transactions with other\naccounts. His or her investment(s) may create\nan incentive for the portfolio manager to\nfavor one account over another. The Adviser\nhas adopted policies and procedures reasonably\ndesigned to address these potential material\nconflicts. For instance, portfolio managers\nare normally responsible for all accounts\nwithin a certain investment discipline, and do\nnot, absent special circumstances,\ndifferentiate among the various accounts when\nallocating resources. Additionally, the\nAdviser and its advisory affiliates have\nprocesses and procedures for allocating\ninvestment opportunities among portfolios that\nare designed to provide a fair and equitable\nallocation.\n                      33                      \nSSGA\u2019s culture is complemented and reinforced\nby a total rewards strategy that is based on a\npay for performance philosophy which seeks to\noffer a competitive pay mix of base salary,\nbenefits, cash incentives and deferred\ncompensation.\n\nSalary is based on a number of factors,\nincluding external benchmarking data and\nmarket trends, State Street performance, SSGA\nperformance, and individual overall\nperformance. SSGA\u2019s Global Human Resources\ndepartment regularly participates in\ncompensation surveys in order to provide SSGA\nwith market-based compensation information\nthat helps support individual pay decisions.\n\nAdditionally, subject to State Street and SSGA\nbusiness results, State Street allocates an\nincentive pool to SSGA to reward its\nemployees. The size of the incentive pool for\nmost business units is based on the firm\u2019s\noverall profitability and other factors,\nincluding performance against risk-related\ngoals. For most SSGA investment teams, SSGA\nrecognizes and rewards performance by linking\nannual incentive decisions for investment\nteams to the firm\u2019s or business unit\u2019s\nprofitability and business unit investment\nperformance over a multi-year period.\n\nIncentive pool funding for most active\ninvestment teams is driven in part by the\npost-tax investment performance of fund(s)\nmanaged by the team versus the return levels\nof the benchmark index(es) of the fund(s) on a\none-, three- and, in some cases, five-year\nbasis. For most active investment teams, a\nmaterial portion of incentive compensation for\nsenior staff is deferred over a four-year\nperiod into the SSGA Long-Term Incentive\n(\u201cSSGA LTI\u201d) program. For these teams, The\nSSGA LTI program indexes the performance of\nthese deferred awards against the post-tax\ninvestment performance of fund(s) managed by\nthe team. This is intended to align our\ninvestment team\u2019s compensation with client\ninterests, both through annual incentive\ncompensation awards and through the long-term\nvalue of deferred awards in the SSGA LTI\nprogram.\n\nFor the passive equity investment team,\nincentive pool funding is driven in part by\nthe post-tax 1 and 3-year tracking error of\nthe funds managed by the team against the\nbenchmark indexes of the funds.\n\nThe discretionary allocation of the incentive\npool to the business units within SSGA is\ninfluenced by market-based compensation data,\nas well as the overall performance of each\nbusiness unit. Individual compensation\ndecisions are made by the employee\u2019s manager,\nin conjunction with the senior management of\nthe employee\u2019s business unit. These decisions\nare based on the overall performance of the\nemployee and, as mentioned above, on the\nperformance of the firm and business unit.\nDepending on the job level, a portion of the\nannual incentive may be awarded in deferred\ncompensation, which may include cash and/or\nDeferred Stock Awards (State Street stock),\nwhich typically vest over a four-year period.\nThis helps to retain staff and further aligns\nSSGA employees\u2019 interests with SSGA clients\u2019\nand shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.\n\nSSGA recognizes and rewards outstanding\nperformance by:\n                                              \n       Promoting employee ownership to        \n  \u2022    connect employees directly to the      \n       company\u2019s success.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Using rewards to reinforce mission,    \n       vision, values and business strategy.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Seeking to recognize and preserve the  \n  \u2022    firm\u2019s unique culture and team         \n       orientation.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Providing all employees the            \n  \u2022    opportunity to share in the success    \n       of SSGA.                               \n                                              \nTHE ADMINISTRATOR, SUB-ADMINISTRATOR,\nCUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT\n\nAdministrator.

As\nCustodian, State Street holds Fund assets,\ncalculates the net asset value of the Shares\nand calculates net income and realized capital\ngains or losses. State Street and the Trust\nwill comply with the self-custodian provisions\nof Rule 17f-2 under the 1940 Act.\n                      34                      \nState Street also serves as Transfer Agent for\neach series of the Trust pursuant to a\ntransfer agency agreement (\u201cTransfer Agency\nAgreement\u201d).\n\nCompensation. As compensation for its services\nprovided under the SSGA Administration\nagreement, SSGA FM, shall receive fees for the\nservices, calculated based on the average\naggregate net assets of the Trust and SPDR\nIndex Shares Funds (\u201cSIS\u201d), which are accrued\ndaily and paid monthly out of its management\nfee.\n\nAs compensation for its services under the\nSub-Administration Agreement, Custodian\nAgreement and Transfer Agency Agreement, State\nStreet shall receive a fee for the services,\ncalculated based on the average aggregate net\nassets of the Trust and SIS, which are accrued\ndaily and paid monthly by the Adviser from its\nmanagement fee.

Its principal\naddress is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. Investor information can\nbe obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257. The\nDistributor has entered into a distribution\nagreement (\u201cDistribution Agreement\u201d) with the\nTrust pursuant to which it distributes Shares\nof the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will\ncontinue for two years from its effective date\nand is renewable annually thereafter. Shares\nwill be continuously offered for sale by the\nTrust through the Distributor only in Creation\nUnits, as described in the Prospectus and\nbelow under \u201cPurchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units.\u201d Shares in less than Creation\nUnits are not distributed by the Distributor.\nThe Distributor will deliver the Prospectus to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nand confirmations of acceptance furnished by\nit. The Distributor is a broker-dealer\nregistered under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and a member of\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n(\u201cFINRA\u201d). The Distributor has no role in\ndetermining the investment policies of the\nTrust or which securities are to be purchased\nor sold by the Trust. An affiliate of the\n\nDistributor may assist Authorized Participants\n(as defined below) in assembling shares to\npurchase Creation Units or upon redemption,\nfor which it may receive commissions or other\nfees from such Authorized Participants. An\naffiliate of the Distributor also receives\ncompensation from State Street for providing\non-line creation and redemption functionality\nto Authorized Participants through its Fund\nConnect application.\n\nThe Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of\nthe Adviser or Distributor, may directly or\nindirectly make cash payments to certain\nbroker-dealers for participating in activities\nthat are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives and other professionals more\nknowledgeable about exchange traded products,\nincluding the SPDR funds, or for other\nactivities, such as participation in marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems.\n\nIn addition, as of the date of this SAI, the\nAdviser and/or Distributor had arrangements\nwhereby they may make payments, other than for\nthe educational programs and marketing\nactivities described above, to Pershing LLC\n(\u201cPershing\u201d), RBC Capital Markets, LLC\n(\u201cRBC\u201d), LPL Financial, LLC (\u201cLPL\u201d), and\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management, LLC. These\namounts, which may be significant, are paid by\nthe Adviser and/or Distributor from their own\nresources and not from Fund assets. Pursuant\nto these arrangements, Pershing, RBC and LPL\nhave agreed to offer certain SPDR funds to\ntheir customers and not to charge certain of\ntheir customers any commissions when those\ncustomers purchase or sell shares of certain\nSPDR funds. Payments to a broker-dealer or\nintermediary may create potential conflicts of\ninterest between the broker dealer or\nintermediary and its clients.\n\nIn addition, the Adviser or Distributor, or an\naffiliate of the Adviser or Distributor, as\nwell as an index provider that is not\naffiliated with the Adviser or Distributor,\nmay reimburse expenses or make payments from\ntheir own assets to other persons in\nconsideration of services, provision of data,\nor other activities that they believe may\nbenefit the SPDR business or facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds.\n                      35                      \nThe Distribution Agreement provides that it\nmay be terminated at any time, without the\npayment of any penalty, as to the Fund: (i) by\nvote of a majority of the Independent Trustees\nor (ii) by vote of a majority (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund, on at least 60 days\nwritten notice to the Distributor. The\nDistribution Agreement is also terminable upon\n60 days\u2019 notice by the Distributor and will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).\n\nThe continuation of the Distribution Agreement\nand any other related agreements is subject to\nannual approval of the Board, including by a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees, as\ndescribed above.\n\nThe allocation among the Trust\u2019s series of\nfees and expenses payable under the\nDistribution Agreement will be made pro rata\nin accordance with the daily net assets of the\nrespective series.\n\nThe Distributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers (\u201cSoliciting Dealers\u201d)\nwho will solicit purchases of Creation Unit\naggregations of Shares. Such Soliciting\nDealers may also be Participating Parties (as\ndefined in the \u201cBook Entry Only System\u201d\nsection below) and/or DTC Participants (as\ndefined below).\n\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the\nTrust has agreed to indemnify the Distributor,\nand may indemnify Soliciting Dealers and\nAuthorized Participants (as described below)\nentering into agreements with the Distributor,\nfor certain liabilities, including certain\nliabilities arising under the federal\nsecurities laws, unless such loss or liability\nresults from willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its\nobligations and duties under the Distribution\nAgreement or other agreement, as applicable.\n                                              \n            BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS            \n                                              \nPortfolio transactions are placed on behalf of\nthe Fund by the Adviser. Purchases and sales\nof securities on a securities exchange are\naffected through brokers who charge a\ncommission for their services. Ordinarily\ncommissions are not charged on over the\ncounter orders (e.g., fixed income securities)\nbecause the Fund pays a spread which is\nincluded in the cost of the security and\nrepresents the difference between the dealer\u2019s\nquoted price at which it is willing to sell\nthe security and the dealer\u2019s quoted price at\nwhich it is willing to buy the security. When\nthe Fund executes an over the counter order\nwith an electronic communications network or\nan alternative trading system, a commission is\ncharged by such electronic communications\nnetworks and alternative trading systems as\nthey execute such orders on an agency basis.\nSecurities may be purchased from underwriters\nat prices that include underwriting fees.\n\nIn placing a portfolio transaction, the\nAdviser seeks to achieve best execution. The\nAdviser\u2019s duty to seek best execution requires\nthe Adviser to take reasonable steps to obtain\nfor the client as favorable an overall result\nas possible for Fund portfolio transactions\nunder the circumstances, taking into account\nvarious factors that are relevant to the\nparticular transaction.\n\nThe Adviser refers to and selects from the\nlist of approved trading counterparties\nmaintained by the Adviser\u2019s Credit Risk\nManagement team. In selecting a trading\ncounterparty for a particular trade, the\nAdviser seeks to weigh relevant factors\nincluding, but not limited to the following:\n                                       \n  \u2022    Prompt and reliable execution;  \n                                       \n                                              \n  \u2022    The competitiveness of commission      \n       rates and spreads, if applicable;      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The financial strength, stability      \n  \u2022    and/or reputation of the trading       \n       counterparty;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       The willingness and ability of the     \n       executing trading counterparty to      \n  \u2022    execute transactions (and commit       \n       capital) of size in liquid and         \n       illiquid markets without disrupting    \n       the market for the security;           \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Local laws, regulations or             \n       restrictions;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       The ability of the trading             \n  \u2022    counterparty to maintain               \n       confidentiality;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       The availability and capability of     \n       execution venues, including            \n  \u2022    electronic communications networks     \n       for trading and execution management   \n       systems made available to Adviser;     \n                                              \n                      \n  \u2022    Market share;  \n                      \n                   \n  \u2022    Liquidity;  \n                   \n               \n  \u2022    Price;  \n               \n                                 \n  \u2022    Execution related costs;  \n                                 \n                                        \n  \u2022    History of execution of orders;  \n                                        \n                      36                      \n                                              \n  \u2022    Likelihood of execution and            \n       settlement;                            \n                                              \n                               \n  \u2022    Order size and nature;  \n                               \n                                              \n       Clearance and settlement               \n  \u2022    capabilities, especially in high       \n       volatility market environments;        \n                                              \n                                             \n  \u2022    Availability of lendable securities;  \n                                             \n                                              \n       Sophistication of the trading          \n  \u2022    counterparty\u2019s trading capabilities    \n       and infrastructure/facilities;         \n                                              \n                                              \n       The operational efficiency with which  \n  \u2022    transactions are processed and         \n       cleared, taking into account the       \n       order size and complexity;             \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Speed and responsiveness to the        \n       Adviser;                               \n                                              \n                                     \n  \u2022    Access to secondary markets;  \n                                     \n                                   \n  \u2022    Counterparty exposure; and  \n                                   \n                                              \n       Depending upon the circumstances, the  \n       Adviser may take other relevant        \n       factors into account if the Adviser    \n  \u2022    believes that these are important in   \n       taking all sufficient steps to obtain  \n       the best possible result for           \n       execution of the order.                \n                                              \nIn selecting a trading counterparty, the price\nof the transaction and costs related to the\nexecution of the transaction typically merit a\nhigh relative importance, depending on the\ncircumstances. The Adviser does not\nnecessarily select a trading counterparty\nbased upon price and costs but may take other\nrelevant factors into account if it believes\nthat these are important in taking reasonable\nsteps to obtain the best possible result for\nthe Fund under the circumstances.\nConsequently, the Adviser may cause a client\nto pay a trading counterparty more than\nanother trading counterparty might have\ncharged for the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value and quality of the\nbrokerage services provided. The following\nmatters may influence the relative importance\nthat the Adviser places upon the relevant\nfactors:\n\n(i) The nature and characteristics of the\norder or transaction. For example, size of\norder, market impact of order, limits, or\nother instructions relating to the order;\n\n(ii) The characteristics of the financial\ninstrument(s) or other assets which are the\nsubject of that order. For example, whether\nthe order pertains to an equity, fixed income,\nderivative or convertible instrument;\n\n(iii) The characteristics of the execution\nvenues to which that order can be directed, if\nrelevant. For example, availability and\ncapabilities of electronic trading systems;\n\n(iv) Whether the transaction is a \u2018delivery\nversus payment\u2019 or \u2018over the counter\u2019\ntransaction. The creditworthiness of the\ntrading counterparty, the amount of existing\nexposure to a trading counterparty and trading\ncounterparty settlement capabilities may be\ngiven a higher relative importance in the case\nof \u2018over the counter\u2019 transactions; and/or\n\n(v) Any other circumstances that the Adviser\nbelieves are relevant at the time.\n\nThe process by which trading counterparties\nare selected to effect transactions is\ndesigned to exclude consideration of the sales\nefforts conducted by broker-dealers in\nrelation to the Fund.\n\nThe Adviser does not currently use the Fund\u2019s\nassets in connection with third party soft\ndollar arrangements. While the Adviser does\nnot currently use \u201csoft\u201d or commission dollars\npaid by the Fund for the purchase of third\nparty research, the Adviser reserves the right\nto do so in the future.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not pay\nbrokerage commissions during the past three\nfiscal years.\n\nSecurities of \u201cRegular Broker-Dealers.\u201d The\nTrustis required to identify any securities of\nits \u201cregular brokers and dealers\u201d (as such\nterm is defined in the 1940 Act) which it may\nhold at the close of its most recent fiscal\nyear. \u201cRegular brokers or dealers\u201d of the\nTrust are the ten brokers or dealers that,\nduring the most recent fiscal year: (i)\nreceived the greatest dollar amounts of\nbrokerage commissions from the Trust\u2019s\nportfolio transactions; (ii) engaged as\nprincipal in the largest dollar amounts of\nportfolio transactions of the Trust; or (iii)\nsold the largest dollar amounts of the Trust\u2019s\nshares.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any holdings in Securities of Regular\nBroker-Dealers as of June 30, 2021.\n                      37                      \nPortfolio Turnover. Portfolio turnover may\nvary from year to year, as well as within a\nyear. High turnover rates are likely to result\nin comparatively greater brokerage expenses or\ntransaction costs. The overall reasonableness\nof brokerage commissions and transaction costs\nis evaluated by the Adviser based upon its\nknowledge of available information as to the\ngeneral level of commissions and transaction\ncosts paid by other institutional investors\nfor comparable services.\n                                              \n            BOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM            \n                                              \nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u201cADDITIONAL\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION.\u201d\n\nThe Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) acts as\nsecurities depositary for the Shares. Shares\nof the Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee,\nCede & Co., and deposited with, or on behalf\nof, DTC. Except in the limited circumstance\nprovided below, certificates will not be\nissued for Shares.\n\nDTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was\ncreated to hold securities of its participants\n(the \u201cDTC Participants\u201d) and to facilitate the\nclearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions among the DTC Participants in\nsuch securities through electronic book-entry\nchanges in accounts of the DTC Participants,\nthereby eliminating the need for physical\nmovement of securities certificates. DTC\nParticipants include securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations,\nsome of whom (and/or their representatives)\nown DTC. More specifically, DTC is owned by a\nnumber of its DTC Participants and by the New\nYork Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and FINRA. Access\nto the DTC system is also available to others\nsuch as banks, brokers, dealers and trust\ncompanies that clear through or maintain a\ncustodial relationship with a DTC Participant,\neither directly or indirectly (the \u201cIndirect\nParticipants\u201d).\n\nBeneficial ownership of Shares is limited to\nDTC Participants, Indirect Participants and\npersons holding interests through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in Shares\n(owners of such beneficial interests are\nreferred to herein as \u201cBeneficial Owners\u201d) is\nshown on, and the transfer of ownership is\neffected only through, records maintained by\nDTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on\nthe records of DTC Participants (with respect\nto Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of Shares.\n\nConveyance of all notices, statements and\nother communications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the Shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust,\neither directly or through a third party\nservice, shall inquire of each such DTC\nParticipant as to the number of Beneficial\nOwners holding Shares, directly or indirectly,\nthrough such DTC Participant. The Trust,\neither directly or through a third party\nservice, shall provide each such DTC\nParticipant with copies of such notice,\nstatement or other communication, in such\nform, number and at such place as such DTC\nParticipant may reasonably request, in order\nthat such notice, statement or communication\nmay be transmitted by such DTC Participant,\ndirectly or indirectly, to such Beneficial\nOwners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to\neach such DTC Participant and/or third party\nservice a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to\nsuch transmittal, all subject to applicable\nstatutory and regulatory requirements.\n\nShare distributions shall be made to DTC or\nits nominee, Cede & Co., as the registered\nholder of all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon\nreceipt of any such distributions, shall\ncredit immediately DTC Participants\u2019 accounts\nwith payments in amounts proportionate to\ntheir respective beneficial interests in\nShares of the Fund as shown on the records of\nDTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC\nParticipants to Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners of Shares held through such\nDTC Participants will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is\nnow the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in bearer form or\nregistered in a \u201cstreet name,\u201d and will be the\nresponsibility of such DTC Participants.\n\nThe Trust has no responsibility or liability\nfor any aspects of the records relating to or\nnotices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made\non account of beneficial ownership interests\nin such Shares, or for maintaining,\nsupervising or reviewing any records relating\nto such beneficial ownership interests or for\nany other aspect of the relationship between\nDTC and the DTC Participants or the\nrelationship between such DTC Participants and\nthe Indirect Participants and Beneficial\nOwners owning through such DTC Participants.\n\nDTC may determine to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to Shares at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action\neither to find a replacement for DTC to\nperform its functions at a comparable cost or,\nif such a replacement is unavailable, to issue\nand deliver printed certificates representing\nownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes\nother arrangements with respect thereto\nsatisfactory to the Exchange.\n                      38                      \n                                              \n   CONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF   \n                  SECURITIES                  \nThe Fund had not commenced operations prior to\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any beneficial owners that owned greater\nthan 5% of the outstanding voting securities\nas of the date of this SAI.\n\nAn Authorized Participant (as defined below)\nmay hold of record more than 25% of the\noutstanding Shares. From time to time,\nAuthorized Participants may be a beneficial\nand/or legal owner of the Fund, may be\naffiliated with an index provider, may be\ndeemed to have control of the Fund and/or may\nbe able to affect the outcome of matters\npresented for a vote of the shareholders of\nthe Fund.

A \u201cBusiness Day\u201d\nwith respect to the Fund is, generally, any\nday on which the NYSE is open for business,\nwith the exception of Veterans Day and\nColumbus Day.\n\nFUND DEPOSIT. The consideration for purchase\nof a Creation Unit of the Fund generally\nconsists of either (i) the Deposit Securities\nand the Cash Component (defined below),\ncomputed as described below or (ii) the cash\nvalue of the Deposit Securities and \u201cCash\nComponent,\u201d computed as described below. When\naccepting purchases of Creation Units for\ncash, the Fund may incur additional costs\nassociated with the acquisition of Deposit\nSecurities that would otherwise be provided by\nan in-kind purchaser.\n\nTogether, the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u201cFund Deposit,\u201d which\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of the\nFund. The \u201cCash Component\u201d which may include a\nDividend Equivalent Payment, is an amount\nequal to the difference between the net asset\nvalue of the Shares (per Creation Unit) and\nthe market value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable. The \u201cDividend\nEquivalent Payment\u201d enables the Fund to make a\ncomplete distribution of dividends on the day\npreceding the next dividend payment date, and\nis an amount equal, on a per Creation Unit\nbasis, to the dividends on all the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund (\u201cDividend Securities\u201d)\nwith ex-dividend dates within the accumulation\nperiod for such distribution (the\n\u201cAccumulation Period\u201d), net of expenses and\nliabilities for such period, as if all of the\nDividend Securities had been held by the Fund\nfor the entire Accumulation Period. The\nAccumulation Period begins on the ex-dividend\ndate for the Fund and ends on the day\npreceding the next ex-dividend date. If the\nCash Component is a positive number (i.e., the\nnet asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the\nmarket value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash\nComponent shall be such positive amount. If\nthe Cash Component is a negative number (i.e.,\nthe net asset value per Creation Unit is less\nthan the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),\nthe Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to\nreceive cash in an amount equal to the Cash\nComponent. The Cash Component serves the\nfunction of compensating for any differences\nbetween the net asset value per Creation Unit\nand the market value of the Deposit Securities\nor Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of\nthe Cash Component excludes any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities, if applicable, which shall\nbe the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below).\n\nThe Custodian, through NSCC, makes available\non each Business Day, prior to the opening of\nbusiness on the NYSE (currently 9:30 a.m.,\nEastern time), the list of the names and the\nrequired number of shares of each Deposit\nSecurity or the required amount of Deposit\nCash, as applicable, to be included in the\ncurrent standard Fund Deposit (based on\ninformation at the end of the previous\nBusiness\n                      39                      \nDay) for the Fund. Such standard Fund Deposit\nis subject to any applicable adjustments as\ndescribed below, in order to effect purchases\nof Creation Units of the Fund until such time\nas the next-announced composition of the\nDeposit Securities or the required amount of\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, is made\navailable.\n\nThe identity and number of shares of the\nDeposit Securities or the amount of Deposit\nCash, as applicable, required for a Fund\nDeposit for the Fund may be changed from time\nto time with a view to the investment\nobjective of the Fund. Information regarding a\nFund Deposit necessary for the purchase of a\nCreation Unit is made available to Authorized\nParticipants and other market participants\nseeking to transact in Creation Unit\naggregations.\n\nAs noted above, the Trust reserves the right\nto permit or require the substitution of\nDeposit Cash to replace any Deposit Security,\nwhich shall be added to the Cash Component,\nincluding, without limitation, in situations\nwhere the Deposit Security: (i) may not be\navailable in sufficient quantity for delivery,\n(ii) may not be eligible for transfer through\nthe systems of DTC for corporate securities\nand municipal securities or the Federal\nReserve System for U.S. Treasury securities;\n(iii) may not be eligible for trading by an\nAuthorized Participant (as defined below) or\nthe investor for which it is acting; (iv)\nwould be restricted under the securities laws\nor where the delivery of the Deposit Security\nto the Authorized Participant would result in\nthe disposition of the Deposit Security by the\nAuthorized Participant becoming restricted\nunder the securities laws, or (v) in certain\nother situations (collectively, \u201cnon-standard\norders\u201d). The Trust also reserves the right\nto: (i) permit or require the substitution of\nDeposit Securities in lieu of Deposit Cash;\nand (ii) include or remove Deposit Securities\nfrom the basket in anticipation of portfolio\nchanges. The adjustments described above will\nreflect changes, known to the Adviser on the\ndate of announcement to be in effect by the\ntime of delivery of the Fund Deposit, in the\ncomposition of the subject Index being tracked\nby the Fund or resulting from certain\ncorporate actions.\n\nPROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the Principal\nUnderwriter, as facilitated via the Transfer\nAgent, to purchase a Creation Unit of the\nFund, an entity must be (i) a \u201cParticipating\nParty\u201d, i.e., a broker-dealer or other\nparticipant in the clearing process through\nthe Continuous Net Settlement System of the\nNSCC (the \u201cClearing Process\u201d), a clearing\nagency that is registered with the SEC; or\n(ii) a DTC Participant (see \u201cBOOK ENTRY ONLY\nSYSTEM\u201d) and have the ability to clear through\nthe Federal Reserve System. In addition, each\nParticipating Party or DTC Participant (each,\nan \u201cAuthorized Participant\u201d) must execute a\nParticipant Agreement that has been agreed to\nby the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer\nAgent, and that has been accepted by the\nTrust, with respect to purchases and\nredemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized\nParticipant will agree, pursuant to the terms\nof a Participant Agreement, on behalf of\nitself or any investor on whose behalf it will\nact, to certain conditions, including that it\nwill pay to the Trust, an amount of cash\nsufficient to pay the Cash Component together\nwith the creation transaction fee (described\nbelow) and any other applicable fees, taxes\nand additional variable charge.\n\nAll orders to purchase Shares directly from\nthe Fund, including non-standard orders, must\nbe placed for one or more Creation Units and\nin the manner and by the time set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement and/or the applicable\norder form. The date on which an order to\npurchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem\nCreation Units, as set forth below) is\nreceived and accepted is referred to as the\n\u201cOrder Placement Date.\u201d\n\nAn Authorized Participant may require an\ninvestor to make certain representations or\nenter into agreements with respect to the\norder (e.g., to provide for payments of cash,\nwhen required). Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not have executed\na Participant Agreement and that, therefore,\norders to purchase Shares directly from the\nFund in Creation Units have to be placed by\nthe investor\u2019s broker through an Authorized\nParticipant that has executed a Participant\nAgreement. In such cases there may be\nadditional charges to such investor. At any\ngiven time, there may be only a limited number\nof broker-dealers that have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and only a small number\nof such Authorized Participants may have\ninternational capabilities.\n\nOn days when the Exchange or the bond markets\nclose earlier than normal, the Fund may\nrequire orders to create Creation Units to be\nplaced earlier in the day. In addition, if a\nmarket or markets on which the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are primarily traded is closed,\nthe Fund will also generally not accept orders\non such day(s). Orders must be transmitted by\nan Authorized Participant by telephone or\nother transmission method acceptable to the\nDistributor pursuant to procedures set forth\nin the Participant Agreement and in accordance\nwith the applicable order form. Those placing\norders through an Authorized Participant\nshould allow sufficient time to permit proper\nsubmission of the purchase order by the cut-\noff time. Economic or market disruptions or\nchanges, or telephone or other communication\nfailure may impede the ability to reach the\nDistributor or an Authorized Participant.\n\nFund Deposits must be delivered by an\nAuthorized Participant through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government\nsecurities), or through DTC (for corporate\nsecurities and municipal securities), through\na subcustody agent (for foreign securities)\nand/or through such other arrangements allowed\nby the Trust or its agents. With respect to\nforeign Deposit Securities, the Custodian\nshall cause the subcustodian of the Fund to\nmaintain an account into which the Authorized\nParticipant shall deliver, on behalf of itself\nor the party on whose behalf it is acting,\nsuch Deposit Securities. Foreign Deposit\nSecurities must be delivered to an account\nmaintained at the applicable local\nsubcustodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must\nbe ordered by the Authorized Participant in a\ntimely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of\nthe requisite number of Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, to the account of\nthe\n                      40                      \nFund or its agents by no later than the\nSettlement Date. The \u201cSettlement Date\u201d for the\nFund is generally the second Business Day\n(\u201cT+2\u201d) after the Order Placement Date. All\nquestions as to the number of Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as\napplicable, and the validity, form and\neligibility (including time of receipt) for\nthe deposit of any tendered securities or\ncash, as applicable, will be determined by the\nTrust, whose determination shall be final and\nbinding. The amount of cash represented by the\nCash Component must be transferred directly to\nthe Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank\nwire transfer system in a timely manner so as\nto be received by the Custodian no later than\nthe Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and\nthe Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, are not received in a timely\nmanner by the Settlement Date, the creation\norder may be cancelled. Upon written notice to\nthe Distributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using a\nFund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect\nthe then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery\nof Creation Units so created generally will\noccur no later than the second Business Day\nfollowing the day on which the purchase order\nis deemed received by the Distributor.\n\nThe order shall be deemed to be received on\nthe Business Day on which the order is placed\nprovided that the order is placed in proper\nform prior to the applicable cut-off time and\nthe federal funds in the appropriate amount\nare deposited by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions),\nwith the Custodian on the Settlement Date. If\nthe order is not placed in proper form as\nrequired, or federal funds in the appropriate\namount are not received by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00\np.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, then the\norder may be deemed to be rejected and the\nAuthorized Participant shall be liable to the\nFund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom.\nA creation request is considered to be in\n\u201cproper form\u201d if all procedures set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, order form and this\nSAI are properly followed.\n\nISSUANCE OF A CREATION UNIT. Except as\nprovided herein, Creation Units will not be\nissued until the transfer of good title to the\nTrust of the Deposit Securities or payment of\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, and the payment\nof the Cash Component have been completed.\nWhen the subcustodian has confirmed to the\nCustodian that the required Deposit Securities\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant\nsubcustodian or subcustodians, the Principal\nUnderwriter and the Adviser shall be notified\nof such delivery, and the Trust will issue and\ncause the delivery of the Creation Units.\n\nIn instances where the Trust accepts Deposit\nSecurities for the purchase of a Creation\nUnit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in\nadvance of receipt by the Trust of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nas described below. In these circumstances,\nthe initial deposit will have a value greater\nthan the net asset value of the Shares on the\ndate the order is placed in proper form since\nin addition to available Deposit Securities,\ncash must be deposited in an amount equal to\nthe sum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii)\nan additional amount of cash equal to a\npercentage of the market value as set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, of the undelivered\nDeposit Securities (the \u201cAdditional Cash\nDeposit\u201d), which shall be maintained in a\ngeneral non-interest bearing collateral\naccount. An additional amount of cash shall be\nrequired to be deposited with the Trust,\npending delivery of the missing Deposit\nSecurities to the extent necessary to maintain\nthe Additional Cash Deposit with the Trust in\nan amount at least equal to the applicable\npercentage, as set forth in the Participant\nAgreement, of the daily marked to market value\nof the missing Deposit Securities. The Trust\nmay use such Additional Cash Deposit to buy\nthe missing Deposit Securities at any time.\nAuthorized Participants will be liable to the\nTrust for all costs, expenses, dividends,\nincome and taxes associated with missing\nDeposit Securities, including the costs\nincurred by the Trust in connection with any\nsuch purchases. These costs will be deemed to\ninclude the amount by which the actual\npurchase price of the Deposit Securities\nexceeds the market value of such Deposit\nSecurities on the day the purchase order was\ndeemed received by the Principal Underwriter\nplus the brokerage and related transaction\ncosts associated with such purchases. The\nTrust will return any unused portion of the\nAdditional Cash Deposit once all of the\nmissing Deposit Securities have been properly\nreceived by the Custodian or purchased by the\nTrust and deposited into the Trust. In\naddition, a transaction fee as set forth below\nunder \u201cCreation Transaction Fees\u201d will be\ncharged in all cases and an additional\nvariable charge may also be applied. The\ndelivery of Creation Units so created\ngenerally will occur no later than the\nSettlement Date.\n\nACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF CREATION UNITS. The\nTrust reserves the right to reject an order\nfor Creation Units transmitted in respect of\nthe Fund at its discretion, including, without\nlimitation, if (a) the order is not in proper\nform or the Deposit Securities delivered do\nnot consist of the securities that the\nCustodian specified; (b) the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable,\ndelivered by the Authorized Participant are\nnot as disseminated through the facilities of\nthe NSCC for that date by the Custodian; (c)\nthe investor(s), upon obtaining the Shares\nordered, would own 80% or more of the\ncurrently outstanding Shares of the Fund; (d)\nthe acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in\nthe opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the\nacceptance or receipt of the order for a\nCreation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel\nto the Trust, be unlawful; or (f) in the event\nthat circumstances outside the control of the\nTrust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent, the\nDistributor and/or the Adviser make it for all\npractical purposes not feasible to process\norders for Creation Units. Examples of such\ncircumstances include acts of God or public\nservice or utility problems such as fires,\nfloods, extreme weather conditions and power\noutages resulting in telephone, telecopy and\ncomputer failures; market conditions or\nactivities causing trading halts; systems\nfailures involving computer or other\ninformation systems affecting the Trust, the\nPrincipal Underwriter, the Custodian, the\nTransfer Agent, DTC, NSCC, Federal Reserve\nSystem, or any other participant in the\ncreation process, and other extraordinary\nevents. The Trust or its agents shall\ncommunicate to the Authorized Participant its\nrejection of an order. The Trust, the Transfer\nAgent, the Custodian and the Principal\nUnderwriter are under no duty, however, to\ngive notification of any defects or\nirregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall either of them incur any\nliability for the failure to give any such\n                      41                      \nnotification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent,\nthe Custodian and the Principal Underwriter\nshall not be liable for the rejection of any\npurchase order for Creation Units. Given the\nimportance of the ongoing issuance of Creation\nUnits to maintaining a market price that is at\nor close to the underlying net asset value of\nthe Fund, the Trust does not intend to suspend\nacceptance of orders for Creation Units.\n\nAll questions as to the number of shares of\neach security in the Deposit Securities and\nthe validity, form, eligibility and acceptance\nfor deposit of any securities to be delivered\nshall be determined by the Trust, and the\nTrust\u2019s determination shall be final and\nbinding. REDEMPTION. Shares may be redeemed\nonly in Creation Units at their net asset\nvalue next determined after receipt of a\nredemption request in proper form by the Fund\nthrough the Transfer Agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE\nFUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN\nAMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors\nmust accumulate enough Shares in the secondary\nmarket to constitute a Creation Unit in order\nto have such Shares redeemed by the Trust.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that there\nwill be sufficient liquidity in the public\ntrading market at any time to permit assembly\nof a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to\nincur brokerage and other costs in connection\nwith assembling a sufficient number of Shares\nto constitute a redeemable Creation Unit.\n\nWith respect to the Fund, the Custodian,\nthrough the NSCC, makes available prior to the\nopening of business on the NYSE (currently\n9:30 a.m. Eastern time) on each Business Day,\nthe list of the names and share quantities of\nsecurities designated by the Fund that will be\napplicable (subject to possible amendment or\ncorrection) to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day\n(\u201cRedemption Securities\u201d). Redemption\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities. The identity\nand number of shares of the Redemption\nSecurities or the Cash Redemption Amount\n(defined below) may be changed from time to\ntime with a view to the investment objective\nof the Fund.\n\nRedemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are\npaid either in-kind or in cash, or a\ncombination thereof, as determined by the\nTrust. With respect to in-kind redemptions of\nthe Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit will consist of Redemption Securities\nplus cash in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the net asset value of the Shares\nbeing redeemed, as next determined after a\nreceipt of a request in proper form, and the\nvalue of the Redemption Securities (the \u201cCash\nRedemption Amount\u201d), less a fixed redemption\ntransaction fee and any applicable additional\nvariable charge as set forth below. In the\nevent that the Redemption Securities have a\nvalue greater than the net asset value of the\nShares, a compensating cash payment equal to\nthe differential is required to be made by or\nthrough an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, at the Trust\u2019s discretion, an\nAuthorized Participant may receive the\ncorresponding cash value of the securities in\nlieu of the in-kind securities value\nrepresenting one or more Redemption\nSecurities.\n\nPROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS.\nAfter the Trust has deemed an order for\nredemption received, the Trust will initiate\nprocedures to transfer the requisite\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to the Authorized Participant by the\nSettlement Date. With respect to in-kind\nredemptions of the Fund, the calculation of\nthe value of the Redemption Securities and the\nCash Redemption Amount to be delivered upon\nredemption will be made by the Custodian\naccording to the procedures set forth under\n\u201cDetermination of Net Asset Value\u201d, computed\non the Business Day on which a redemption\norder is deemed received by the Trust.\nTherefore, if a redemption order in proper\nform is submitted to the Principal Underwriter\nby a DTC Participant by the specified time on\nthe Order Placement Date, and the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund are delivered to\nthe Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions) on\nthe Settlement Date, then the value of the\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to be delivered will be determined by\nthe Custodian on such Order Placement Date. If\nthe requisite number of Shares of the Fund are\nnot delivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions) on\nthe Settlement Date, the Fund will not release\nthe underlying securities for delivery unless\ncollateral is posted in such percentage amount\nof missing Shares as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement (marked to market\ndaily).\n\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of the\nFund, in connection with taking delivery of\nshares of Redemption Securities upon\nredemption of Creation Units, an Authorized\nParticipant must maintain appropriate custody\narrangements with a qualified broker-dealer,\nbank or other custody providers in each\njurisdiction in which any of the Redemption\nSecurities are customarily traded (or such\nother arrangements as allowed by the Trust or\nits agents), to which account such Redemption\nSecurities will be delivered. Deliveries of\nredemption proceeds generally will be made\nwithin two Business Days of the trade date.\nDue to the schedule of holidays in certain\ncountries, however, the delivery of in-kind\nredemption proceeds may take longer than two\nBusiness Days after the day on which the\nredemption request is received in proper form.\nIf the Authorized Participant has not made\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nthe Redemption Securities in the applicable\nforeign jurisdiction and it is not possible to\nmake other such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of the\nRedemption Securities in such jurisdiction,\nthe Trust may, in its discretion, exercise its\noption to redeem such Shares in cash, and the\nAuthorized Participant will be required to\nreceive its redemption proceeds in cash.\n\nIf it is not possible to make other such\narrangements, or if it is not possible to\neffect deliveries of the Redemption\nSecurities, the Trust may in its discretion\nexercise its option to redeem such Shares in\ncash, and the redeeming investor will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in\ncash. In addition, an investor may request a\nredemption in cash that the Fund may, in its\nsole discretion,\n                      42                      \npermit. In either case, the investor will\nreceive a cash payment equal to the NAV of its\nShares based on the NAV of Shares of the Fund\nnext determined after the redemption request\nis received in proper form (minus a redemption\ntransaction fee and additional charge for\nrequested cash redemptions specified above, to\noffset the Trust\u2019s brokerage and other\ntransaction costs associated with the\ndisposition of Redemption Securities). The\nFund may also, in its sole discretion, upon\nrequest of a shareholder, provide such\nredeemer a portfolio of securities that\ndiffers from the exact composition of the\nRedemption Securities but does not differ in\nnet asset value.\n\nAn Authorized Participant submitting a\nredemption request is deemed to represent to\nthe Trust that, as of the close of the\nBusiness Day on which the redemption request\nwas submitted, it (or its client) will own\n(within the meaning of Rule 200 of Regulation\nSHO) or has arranged to borrow for delivery to\nthe Trust on or prior to the Settlement Date\nof the redemption request, the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund to be redeemed as\na Creation Unit. In either case, the\nAuthorized Participant is deemed to\nacknowledge that: (i) it (or its client) has\nfull legal authority and legal right to tender\nfor redemption the requisite number of Shares\nof the Fund and to receive the entire proceeds\nof the redemption; and (ii) if such Shares\nsubmitted for redemption have been loaned or\npledged to another party or are the subject of\na repurchase agreement, securities lending\nagreement or any other arrangement affecting\nlegal or beneficial ownership of such Shares\nbeing tendered, there are no restrictions\nprecluding the tender and delivery of such\nShares (including borrowed shares, if any) for\nredemption, free and clear of liens, on the\nredemption Settlement Date. The Trust reserves\nthe right to verify these representations at\nits discretion, but will typically require\nverification with respect to a redemption\nrequest from the Fund in connection with\nhigher levels of redemption activity and/or\nshort interest in the Fund. If the Authorized\nParticipant, upon receipt of a verification\nrequest, does not provide sufficient\nverification of its representations as\ndetermined by the Trust, the redemption\nrequest will not be considered to have been\nreceived in proper form and may be rejected by\nthe Trust.\n\nRedemptions of Shares for Redemption\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable federal and state securities laws\nand the Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Trust could not lawfully\ndeliver specific Redemption Securities upon\nredemptions or could not do so without first\nregistering the Redemption Securities under\nsuch laws. An Authorized Participant or an\ninvestor for which it is acting subject to a\nlegal restriction with respect to a particular\nsecurity included in the Redemption Securities\napplicable to the redemption of Creation Units\nmay be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The\nAuthorized Participant may request the\nredeeming investor of the Shares to complete\nan order form or to enter into agreements with\nrespect to such matters as compensating cash\npayment. Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201cqualified institutional buyer,\u201d\n(\u201cQIB\u201d) as such term is defined under Rule\n144A of the Securities Act, will not be able\nto receive Redemption Securities that are\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may\nbe required by the Trust to provide a written\nconfirmation with respect to QIB status in\norder to receive Redemption Securities.\n\nThe right of redemption may be suspended or\nthe date of payment postponed with respect to\nthe Fund (1) for any period during which the\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (2) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Exchange is\nsuspended or restricted; (3) for any period\nduring which an emergency exists as a result\nof which disposal of the Shares of the Fund or\ndetermination of the NAV of the Shares is not\nreasonably practicable; or (4) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\n\nREQUIRED EARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as described in\nthe Participant Agreement and/or applicable\norder form, the Fund may require orders to be\nplaced prior to the trade date, as described\nin the Participant Agreement or the applicable\norder form, in order to receive the trade\ndate\u2019s net asset value. The cut-off time to\nreceive the trade date\u2019s net asset value will\nnot precede the calculation of the net asset\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s shares on the prior\nBusiness Day. Orders to purchase shares of\nsuch funds that are submitted on the Business\nDay immediately preceding a holiday or a day\n(other than a weekend) that the equity markets\nin the relevant foreign market are closed may\nnot be accepted. Authorized Participants may\nbe notified that the cut-off time for an order\nmay be earlier on a particular Business Day,\nas described in the Participant Agreement and\nthe applicable order form.\n\nCREATION AND REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES. A\ntransaction fee, as set forth in the table\nbelow, is imposed for the transfer and other\ntransaction costs associated with the purchase\nor redemption of Creation Units, as\napplicable. Authorized Participants will be\nrequired to pay a fixed creation transaction\nfee and/or a fixed redemption transaction fee,\nas applicable, on a given day regardless of\nthe number of Creation Units created or\nredeemed on that day. The Fund may adjust the\ntransaction fee from time to time. An\nadditional charge or a variable charge\n(discussed below) will be applied to certain\ncreation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standard orders and whole or\npartial cash purchases or redemptions.

Expenses and fees,\nincluding the management fees, are accrued\ndaily and taken into account for purposes of\ndetermining NAV. The NAV of the Fund is\ncalculated by State Street and determined once\ndaily as of the close of the regular trading\nsession on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange\nis open. Creation/redemption order cut-off\ntimes may be earlier on any day that the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable exchange or market\non which the Fund\u2019s investments are traded)\nannounces an early closing time. Any assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S.\ndollars at market rates on the date of\nvaluation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London\ntime) as quoted by one or more sources.\n\nIn calculating the Fund\u2019s NAV per Share, the\nFund\u2019s investments are generally valued using\nmarket valuations. A market valuation\ngenerally means a valuation (i) obtained from\nan exchange, a pricing service, or a major\nmarket maker (or dealer), (ii) based on a\nprice quotation or other equivalent indication\nof value supplied by an exchange, a pricing\nservice, or a major market maker (or dealer)\nor (iii) based on amortized cost. The Fund\nrelies on a third-party service provider for\nassistance with the daily calculation of the\nFund\u2019s NAV. The third-party service provider,\nin turn, relies on other parties for certain\npricing data and other inputs used in the\ncalculation of the Fund\u2019s NAV. Therefore, the\nFund is subject to certain operational risks\nassociated with reliance on its service\nprovider and that service provider\u2019s sources\nof pricing and other data. NAV calculation may\nbe adversely affected by operational risks\narising from factors such as errors or\nfailures in systems and technology. Such\nerrors or failures may result in an\ninaccurately calculated NAV, delays in the\ncalculation of a NAV and/or the inability to\ncalculate a NAV over extended time periods.\nThe Fund may be unable to recover any losses\nassociated with such failures. In the case of\nshares of other funds that are not traded on\nan exchange, a market valuation means such\nfund\u2019s published NAV per share. A price\nobtained from a pricing service based on such\npricing service\u2019s valuation matrix may be\nconsidered a market valuation. The Adviser may\nuse various pricing services, or discontinue\nthe use of any pricing service, as approved by\nthe Board from time to time. Fixed-income\nassets are generally valued as of the\nannounced closing time for trading in fixed-\nincome instruments in a particular market or\nexchange, and generally 4:00 p.m. EST for U.S.\nfixed-income assets. Fixed-income assets are\ngenerally valued at the mean of the bid and\nask prices for bank loans and inflation\nprotected securities, and at the bid price for\nall other fixed-income assets.\n\nIn the event that current market valuations\nare not readily available or are deemed\nunreliable, the Trust\u2019s procedures require the\nOversight Committee to determine a security\u2019s\nfair value. In determining such value the\nOversight Committee may consider, among other\nthings, (i) price comparisons among multiple\nsources, (ii) a review of corporate actions\nand news events, and (iii) a review of\nrelevant financial indicators (e.g., movement\nin interest rates, market indices, and prices\nfrom the Fund\u2019s Index Provider). In these\ncases, the Fund\u2019s NAV may reflect certain\nportfolio securities\u2019 fair values rather than\ntheir market prices. The fair value of a\nportfolio instrument is generally the price\nwhich the Fund might reasonably expect to\nreceive upon its current sale in an orderly\nmarket between market participants.\nAscertaining fair value requires a\ndetermination of the amount that an\narm\u2019s-length buyer, under the circumstances,\nwould currently pay for the portfolio\ninstrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that\nthe fair value determination for a security is\nmaterially different than the value that could\nbe realized upon the sale of the security. In\naddition, fair value pricing could result in a\ndifference between the prices used to\ncalculate the Fund\u2019s NAV and the prices used\nby the Fund\u2019s benchmark Index. This may result\nin a difference between the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the Fund\u2019s benchmark\nIndex. With respect to securities that are\nprimarily listed on foreign exchanges, the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may\nchange on days when you will not be able to\npurchase or sell your Shares.\n                      44                      \n                                              \n         DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS          \nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u201cDISTRIBUTIONS.\u201d\n\nGENERAL POLICIES\n\nDividends from net investment income, if any,\nare generally declared and paid monthly by the\nFund, but may vary significantly from period\nto period. Distributions of net realized\nsecurities gains, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid once a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more frequent\nbasis for the Fund to improve index tracking\nor to comply with the distribution\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code, in\nall events in a manner consistent with the\nprovisions of the 1940 Act.\n\nDividends and other distributions on Shares\nare distributed, as described below, on a pro\nrata basis to Beneficial Owners of such\nShares. Dividend payments are made through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants to\nBeneficial Owners then of record with proceeds\nreceived from the Trust.\n\nManagement of the Trust reserves the right to\ndeclare special dividends if, in its\nreasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve the Fund\u2019s\neligibility for treatment as a RIC under the\nInternal Revenue Code or to avoid imposition\nof income or excise taxes at the Fund level.\n\nDIVIDEND REINVESTMENT\n\nBroker dealers, at their own discretion, may\noffer a dividend reinvestment service under\nwhich Shares are purchased in the secondary\nmarket at current market prices. Investors\nshould consult their broker dealer for further\ninformation regarding any dividend\nreinvestment service offered by such broker\ndealer.\n                    TAXES                     \nThe following is a summary of certain federal\nincome tax considerations generally affecting\nthe Fund and its shareholders that supplements\nthe discussion in the Prospectus. No attempt\nis made to present a comprehensive explanation\nof the federal, state, local or foreign tax\ntreatment of the Fund or its shareholders, and\nthe discussion here and in the Prospectus is\nnot intended to be a substitute for careful\ntax planning.\n\nThe following general discussion of certain\nfederal income tax consequences is based on\nthe Internal Revenue Code and the regulations\nissued thereunder as in effect on the date of\nthis SAI. New legislation, as well as\nadministrative changes or court decisions, may\nsignificantly change the conclusions expressed\nherein, and may have a retroactive effect with\nrespect to the transactions contemplated\nherein.\n\nThe following information should be read in\nconjunction with the section in the Prospectus\nentitled \u201cADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION.\u201d\n\nTAXATION OF THE FUND. The Fund is treated as a\nseparate corporation for federal income tax\npurposes. The Fund therefore is considered to\nbe a separate entity in determining its\ntreatment under the rules for RICs described\nherein and in the Prospectus. Losses in one\nseries of the Trust do not offset gains in any\nother series of the Trust and the requirements\n(other than certain organizational\nrequirements) for qualifying for treatment as\na RIC are determined at the Fund level rather\nthan at the Trust level. The Fund has elected\nor will elect and intends to qualify each year\nto be treated as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. As\nsuch, the Fund should not be subject to\nfederal income tax on its net investment\nincome and capital gains, if any, to the\nextent that it timely distributes such income\nand capital gains to its shareholders. In\norder to qualify for treatment as a RIC, the\nFund must distribute annually to its\nshareholders at least the sum of 90% of its\ntaxable net investment income (generally\nincluding the excess of net short-term capital\ngains over net long-term capital losses) and\n90% of its net tax exempt interest income, if\nany (the \u201cDistribution Requirement\u201d) and also\nmust meet several additional requirements.\nAmong these requirements are the following:\n(i) at least 90% of the Fund\u2019s gross income\neach taxable year must be derived from\ndividends, interest, payments with respect to\ncertain securities loans, gains from the sale\nor other disposition of stock, securities or\nforeign currencies, or other income derived\nwith respect to its business of investing in\nsuch stock, securities or currencies, and net\nincome derived from interests in qualified\npublicly traded partnerships (the \u201cQualifying\nIncome Requirement\u201d); and (ii) at the end of\neach quarter of the Fund\u2019s taxable year, its\nassets must be diversified so that (a) at\nleast 50% of the market value of its total\nassets must be represented by cash and cash\nitems, U.S. government securities, securities\nof other RICs and other securities, with such\nother securities limited, in respect to any\none issuer, to an amount not greater in value\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets and to not more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand\n                      45                      \n(b) not more than 25% of the value of its\ntotal assets is invested in the securities\n(other than U.S. government securities or\nsecurities of other RICs) of any one issuer,\nthe securities (other than securities of other\nRICs) of two or more issuers that it controls\nand that are engaged in the same, similar, or\nrelated trades or businesses, or the\nsecurities of one or more qualified publicly\ntraded partnerships (the \u201cDiversification\nRequirement\u201d).\n\nIf the Fund fails to satisfy the Qualifying\nIncome Requirement or the Diversification\nRequirement in any taxable year, the Fund may\nbe eligible for relief provisions if the\nfailures are due to reasonable cause and not\nwillful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid\nwith respect to each failure to satisfy the\napplicable requirements. Additionally, relief\nis provided for certain de minimis failures of\nthe Diversification Requirement where the Fund\ncorrects the failure within a specified period\nof time. In order to be eligible for the\nrelief provisions with respect to a failure to\nmeet the Diversification Requirement, the Fund\nmay be required to dispose of certain assets.\nIf these relief provisions were not available\nto the Fund and it were to fail to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of\nits taxable income would be subject to tax at\nthe applicable corporate rate without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand its distributions (including capital gains\ndistributions) generally would be taxable as\nordinary income dividends to its shareholders,\nsubject to the dividends-received deduction\nfor corporate shareholders and the lower tax\nrates on qualified dividend income received by\nnoncorporate shareholders. To requalify for\ntreatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable\nyear, the Fund would be required to satisfy\nthe RIC qualification requirements for that\nyear and to distribute any earnings and\nprofits from any year in which the Fund failed\nto qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If the\nFund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, it would\ngenerally be required to pay a Fund-level tax\non certain net built-in gains recognized with\nrespect to certain of its assets upon a\ndisposition of such assets within five years\nof qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year.\nThe Board reserves the right not to maintain\nthe qualification of the Fund for treatment as\na RIC if it determines such course of action\nto be beneficial to shareholders.\n\nAs discussed more fully below, the Fund\nintends to distribute substantially all of its\nnet investment income and its capital gains\nfor each taxable year.\n\nIf the Fund meets the Distribution Requirement\nbut retains some or all of its income or\ngains, it will be subject to federal income\ntax to the extent any such income or gains are\nnot distributed. The Fund may designate\ncertain amounts retained as undistributed net\ncapital gain in a notice to its shareholders,\nwho (i) will be required to include in income\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-\nterm capital gain, their proportionate shares\nof the undistributed amount so designated,\n(ii) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the income tax paid by\nthe Fund on that undistributed amount against\ntheir federal income tax liabilities and to\nclaim refunds to the extent such credits\nexceed their liabilities and (iii) will be\nentitled to increase their tax basis, for\nfederal income tax purposes, in their Shares\nby an amount equal to the excess of the amount\nof undistributed net capital gain included in\ntheir respective income over their respective\nincome tax credits. If the Fund failed to\nsatisfy the Distribution Requirement for any\ntaxable year, it would be taxed as a regular\ncorporation, with consequences generally\nsimilar to those described in the preceding\nparagraph.\n\nThe Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on\ncertain undistributed income if it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders in each\ncalendar year an amount at least equal to 98%\nof its ordinary income for the calendar year\nplus 98.2% of its capital gain net income for\nthe twelve months ended October 31 of such\nyear, subject to an increase for any shortfall\nin the prior year\u2019s distribution. The Fund\nintends to declare and distribute dividends\nand distributions in the amounts and at the\ntimes necessary to avoid the application of\nthis 4% excise tax.\n\nThe Fund may elect to treat part or all of any\n\u201cqualified late year loss\u201d as if it had been\nincurred in the succeeding taxable year in\ndetermining the Fund\u2019s taxable income, net\ncapital gain, net short-term capital gain, and\nearnings and profits. The effect of this\nelection is to treat any such \u201cqualified late\nyear loss\u201d as if it had been incurred in the\nsucceeding taxable year in characterizing Fund\ndistributions for any calendar year. A\n\u201cqualified late year loss\u201d generally includes\nnet capital loss, net long-term capital loss,\nor net short-term capital loss incurred after\nOctober 31 of the current taxable year\n(commonly referred to as \u201cpost-October\nlosses\u201d) and certain other late-year losses.\n\nCapital losses in excess of capital gains\n(\u201cnet capital losses\u201d) are not permitted to be\ndeducted against a RIC\u2019s net investment\nincome. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, potentially subject to certain\nlimitations, the Fund may carry a net capital\nloss from any taxable year forward\nindefinitely to offset its capital gains, if\nany, in years following the year of the loss.\nTo the extent subsequent capital gains are\noffset by such losses, they will not result in\nU.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund\nand may not be distributed as capital gains to\nits shareholders. Generally, the Fund may not\ncarry forward any losses other than net\ncapital losses.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014DISTRIBUTIONS. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income (computed\nwithout regard to the deduction for dividends\npaid), its net tax-exempt income, if any, and\nany net capital gain (net recognized long-term\ncapital gains in excess of net recognized\nshort-term capital losses, taking into account\nany capital loss carryforwards). The Fund will\nreport to shareholders annually the amounts of\ndividends paid from ordinary income and the\namount of distributions of net capital gain.\nSince the Fund primarily holds investments\nthat do not pay\n                      46                      \ndividends, it is not expected that a\nsubstantial portion (if any) of the dividends\npaid by the Fund will qualify for either the\ndividends-received deduction for corporations\nor the favorable income tax rates available to\nindividuals on qualified dividend income.\n\nDistributions from the Fund\u2019s net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be taxable to\nshareholders as ordinary income. Distributions\nfrom the Fund\u2019s net capital gain will be\ntaxable to shareholders at long-term capital\ngains rates, regardless of how long\nshareholders have held their Shares. Long-term\ncapital gains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at reduced rates.\n\nAlthough dividends generally will be treated\nas distributed when paid, any dividend\ndeclared by the Fund in October, November or\nDecember and payable to shareholders of record\nin such a month that is paid during the\nfollowing January will be treated for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes as received by\nshareholders on December 31 of the calendar\nyear in which it was declared.\n\nIf the Fund\u2019s distributions exceed its\nearnings and profits, all or a portion of the\ndistributions made in the taxable year may be\ntreated as a return of capital to\nshareholders. A return of capital distribution\ngenerally will not be taxable but will reduce\nthe shareholder\u2019s cost basis and result in a\nhigher capital gain or lower capital loss when\nthe Shares on which the distribution was\nreceived are sold. After a shareholder\u2019s basis\nin the Shares has been reduced to zero,\ndistributions in excess of earnings and\nprofits will be treated as gain from the sale\nof the shareholder\u2019s Shares.\n\nUnder Section 163(j) of the Code, a taxpayer\u2019s\nbusiness interest expense is generally\ndeductible to the extent of its business\ninterest income and certain other amounts. If\nthe Fund earns business interest income, it\nmay report a portion of its dividends as\n\u201cSection 163(j) interest dividends,\u201d which its\nshareholders may be able to treat as business\ninterest income for purposes of Section\n163(j). The Fund\u2019s \u201cSection 163(j) interest\ndividend\u201d for a tax year will be limited to\nthe excess of its business interest income\nover the sum of its business interest expense\nand other deductions properly allocable to its\nbusiness interest income. In general, the\nFund\u2019s shareholders may treat a distribution\nreported as a Section 163(j) interest dividend\nas interest income only to the extent that the\namount of the distribution exceeds the sum of\nthe portions of the distribution reported as\nother types of tax-favored income. To be\neligible to treat a Section 163(j) interest\ndividend as interest income, a shareholder may\nneed to meet certain holding period\nrequirements in respect of the Shares and must\nnot have hedged its position in the Shares in\ncertain ways.\n\nDistributions that are reinvested in\nadditional Shares through the means of a\ndividend reinvestment service, if offered by\nyour broker-dealer, will nevertheless be\ntaxable dividends to the same extent as if\nsuch dividends had been received in cash.\n\nA 3.8% Medicare contribution tax generally\napplies to all or a portion of the net\ninvestment income of a shareholder who is an\nindividual and not a nonresident alien for\nfederal income tax purposes and who has\nadjusted gross income (subject to certain\nadjustments) that exceeds a threshold amount\n($250,000 if married filing jointly or if\nconsidered a \u201csurviving spouse\u201d for federal\nincome tax purposes, $125,000 if married\nfiling separately, and $200,000 in other\ncases). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a\nportion of the undistributed net investment\nincome of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. For these purposes,\ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains\n(generally including capital gain\ndistributions and capital gains realized on\nthe sale of Shares) are generally taken into\naccount in computing a shareholder\u2019s net\ninvestment income.\n\nDistributions of ordinary income and capital\ngains may also be subject to foreign, state\nand local taxes depending on a shareholder\u2019s\ncircumstances.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS \u2013 SALE OF SHARES. In\ngeneral, a sale of Shares results in capital\ngain or loss, and for individual shareholders,\nis taxable at a federal rate dependent upon\nthe length of time the Shares were held. A\nsale of Shares held for a period of one year\nor less at the time of such sale will, for tax\npurposes, generally result in short-term\ncapital gains or losses, and a sale of those\nheld for more than one year will generally\nresult in long-term capital gains or losses.\nLong-term capital gains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at reduced rates.\n\nGain or loss on the sale of Shares is measured\nby the difference between the amount received\nand the adjusted tax basis of the Shares.\nShareholders should keep records of\ninvestments made (including Shares acquired\nthrough reinvestment of dividends and\ndistributions) so they can compute the tax\nbasis of their Shares.\n\nA loss realized on a sale of Shares may be\ndisallowed if substantially identical Shares\nare acquired (whether through the reinvestment\nof dividends or otherwise) within a sixty-one\n(61) day period beginning thirty (30) days\nbefore and ending thirty (30) days after the\ndate that the Shares are disposed of. In such\na case, the basis of the Shares acquired must\nbe adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.\nAny loss upon the sale of Shares held for six\n(6) months or less will be treated as a long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of any amounts\ntreated as distributions to the shareholder of\nlong-term capital gain (including any amounts\ncredited to the shareholder as undistributed\ncapital gains).\n                      47                      \nCOST BASIS REPORTING. The cost basis of Shares\nacquired by purchase will generally be based\non the amount paid for the Shares and then may\nbe subsequently adjusted for other applicable\ntransactions as required by the Internal\nRevenue Code. The difference between the\nselling price and the cost basis of Shares\ngenerally determines the amount of the capital\ngain or loss realized on the sale or exchange\nof Shares. Contact the broker through whom you\npurchased your Shares to obtain information\nwith respect to the available cost basis\nreporting methods and elections for your\naccount.\n\nTAXATION OF FUND INVESTMENTS. Dividends and\ninterest received by the Fund on foreign\nsecurities may give rise to withholding and\nother taxes imposed by foreign countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nUnited States may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If the Fund meets certain requirements,\nwhich include a requirement that more than 50%\nof the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets at the\nclose of its taxable year consist of certain\nforeign stocks or securities (generally\nincluding foreign government securities), then\nthe Fund should be eligible to file an\nelection with the Internal Revenue Service\n(the \u201cIRS\u201d) that may enable its shareholders,\nin effect, to receive either the benefit of a\nforeign tax credit, or a tax deduction, with\nrespect to certain foreign and U.S.\npossessions income taxes paid by the Fund,\nsubject to certain limitations. Pursuant to\nthis election, the Fund would treat those\ntaxes as dividends paid to its shareholders.\nEach such shareholder would be required to\ninclude a proportionate share of those taxes\nin gross income as income received from a\nforeign source and must treat the amount so\nincluded as if the shareholder had paid the\nforeign tax directly. The shareholder may then\neither deduct the taxes deemed paid by him or\nher in computing his or her taxable income or,\nalternatively, use the foregoing information\nin calculating any foreign tax credit the\nshareholder may be entitled to use against\nsuch shareholder\u2019s federal income tax. If the\nFund makes this election, the Fund will report\nannually to its shareholders the respective\namounts per share of the Fund\u2019s income from\nsources within, and taxes paid to, foreign\ncountries and U.S. possessions. No deduction\nfor such taxes will be permitted to\nindividuals in computing their alternative\nminimum tax liability. If the Fund does not\nmake this election, the Fund may be entitled\nto claim a deduction for certain foreign taxes\nincurred by the Fund. In certain instances,\nthe Fund might not elect to apply otherwise\nallowable U.S. federal income tax deductions\nfor those foreign taxes, whether or not\ncredits or deductions for those foreign taxes\ncould be passed through to its shareholders\npursuant to the election described above. If\nthe Fund does not elect to apply these\ndeductions, taxable distributions you receive\nfrom the Fund may be larger than they would\nhave been if the Fund had taken deductions for\nsuch taxes. Under certain circumstances, if\nthe Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes\npaid in respect of a prior year, the value of\nShares could be affected or any foreign tax\ncredits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund\u2019s foreign\ntaxes for the current year could be reduced.\n\nCertain Fund investments may be subject to\ncomplex provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode (including provisions relating to hedging\ntransactions, straddles, integrated\ntransactions, foreign currency contracts,\nforward foreign currency contracts, and\nnotional principal contracts) that, among\nother things, may affect the character of\ngains and losses realized by the Fund (i.e.,\nmay affect whether gains or losses are\nordinary or capital), accelerate recognition\nof income to the Fund and defer losses. These\nrules could therefore affect the character,\namount and timing of distributions to\nshareholders. These provisions also may\nrequire the Fund to mark-to-market certain\ntypes of positions in its portfolio (i.e.,\ntreat them as if they were closed out) which\nmay cause the Fund to recognize income without\nreceiving cash with which to make\ndistributions to its shareholders in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the RIC distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. The Fund intends to monitor its\ntransactions, intends to make appropriate tax\nelections, and intends to make appropriate\nentries in its books and records in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and\npreserve the Fund\u2019s qualification for\ntreatment as a RIC.\n\nThe Fund is required for federal income tax\npurposes to mark-to-market and recognize as\nincome for each taxable year its net\nunrealized gains and losses on certain futures\ncontracts as of the end of the year as well as\nthose actually realized during the year. Gain\nor loss from futures and options contracts on\nbroad-based indexes required to be marked to\nmarket will be 60% long-term and 40% short-\nterm capital gain or loss. Application of this\nrule may alter the timing and character of\ndistributions to shareholders. The Fund may be\nrequired to defer the recognition of losses on\nfutures contracts, options contracts and swaps\nto the extent of any unrecognized gains on\noffsetting positions held by the Fund. It is\nanticipated that certain net gain realized\nfrom the closing out of futures or options\ncontracts will be considered gain from the\nsale of securities and therefore will be\nqualifying income for purposes of the\nQualifying Income Requirement.\n\nInvestments by the Fund in zero coupon or\nother discount securities will result in\nincome to the Fund equal to a portion of the\nexcess face value of the securities over their\nissue price (the \u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or\n\u201cOID\u201d) each year that the securities are held,\neven though the Fund may receive no cash\ninterest payments or may receive cash interest\npayments that are less than the income\nrecognized for tax purposes. In other\ncircumstances, whether pursuant to the terms\nof a security or as a result of other factors\noutside the control of the Fund, the Fund may\nrecognize income without receiving a\ncommensurate amount of cash. Such income is\nincluded in determining the amount of income\nthat the Fund must distribute to maintain its\neligibility for treatment as a RIC and to\navoid the payment of federal income tax,\nincluding the nondeductible 4% excise tax\ndescribed above.\n\nAny market discount recognized on a market\ndiscount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue, or below adjusted issue price if issued\nwith original issue discount. Absent an\nelection by the Fund to include the market\ndiscount in income as it accrues, gain on the\nFund\u2019s disposition of such an obligation\n                      48                      \nwill be treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued\nmarket discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the OID and/or\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by the Fund, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or\ndispose of securities to enable the Fund to\nmake distributions to its shareholders in\norder to qualify for treatment as a RIC and\neliminate taxes at the Fund level.\n\nSpecial rules apply if the Fund holds\ninflation-indexed bonds, such as Treasury\nInflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).\nGenerally, all stated interest on inflation-\nindexed bonds is taken into income by the Fund\nunder its regular method of accounting for\ninterest income. The amount of any positive\ninflation adjustment for a taxable year, which\nresults from an increase in the inflation-\nadjusted principal amount of the bond, is\ntreated as OID. The amount of the Fund\u2019s OID\nin a taxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund\u2019s taxable income for such\nyear without a corresponding receipt of cash,\nuntil the bond matures. As a result, the Fund\nmay need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for the\napplicable year. The amount of any negative\ninflation adjustments, which result from a\ndecrease in the inflation-adjusted principal\namount of the bond, first reduces the amount\nof interest (including stated interest, OID,\nand market discount, if any) otherwise\nincludable in the Fund\u2019s taxable income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year; any\nremaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain\ncircumstances, carried forward to reduce the\namount of interest income taken into account\nwith respect to the bond in future taxable\nyears.\n\nTAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS. Certain tax-exempt\nshareholders, including qualified pension\nplans, individual retirement accounts, salary\ndeferral arrangements, 401(k) plans, and other\ntax-exempt entities, generally are exempt from\nfederal income taxation except with respect to\ntheir unrelated business taxable income\n(\u201cUBTI\u201d). Under current law, the Fund\ngenerally serves to block UBTI from being\nrealized by its tax-exempt shareholders.\nHowever, notwithstanding the foregoing, tax-\nexempt shareholders could realize UBTI by\nvirtue of their investment in the Fund where,\nfor example, (i) the Fund invests in REITs\nthat hold residual interests in real estate\nmortgage investment conduits (\u201cREMICs\u201d) or\n(ii) Shares constitute debt-financed property\nin the hands of the tax-exempt shareholders\nwithin the meaning of section 514(b) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Charitable remainder\ntrusts are subject to special rules and should\nconsult their tax advisors. The IRS has issued\nguidance with respect to these issues and\nprospective shareholders, especially\ncharitable remainder trusts, are strongly\nencouraged to consult with their tax advisors\nregarding these issues.\n\nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions\nwill be subject to a 1.4% tax on net\ninvestment income. For these purposes, certain\ndividends and capital gain distributions, and\ncertain gains from the disposition of Shares\n(among other categories of income), are\ngenerally taken into account in computing a\nshareholder\u2019s net investment income.\n\nFOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends, other than\ncapital gains dividends, \u201cshort-term capital\ngain dividends\u201d and \u201cinterest-related\ndividends\u201d (described below), paid by the Fund\nto shareholders who are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities will be subject to a 30%\nUnited States withholding tax unless a reduced\nrate of withholding or a withholding exemption\nis provided under applicable treaty law to the\nextent derived from investment income and\nshort-term capital gain or unless such income\nis effectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness carried on through a permanent\nestablishment in the United States.\nNonresident shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors concerning the\napplicability of the United States withholding\ntax and the proper withholding form(s) to be\nsubmitted to the Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an appropriate IRS Form\nW-8 may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate.\n\nDividends reported by the Fund as (i)\ninterest-related dividends, to the extent such\ndividends are derived from the Fund\u2019s\n\u201cqualified net interest income,\u201d or (ii)\nshort-term capital gain dividends, to the\nextent such dividends are derived from the\nFund\u2019s \u201cqualified short-term gain,\u201d are\ngenerally exempt from this 30% withholding\ntax. \u201cQualified net interest income\u201d is the\nFund\u2019s net income derived from U.S.-source\ninterest and original issue discount, subject\nto certain exceptions and limitations.\n\u201cQualified short-term gain\u201d generally means\nthe excess of the Fund\u2019s net short-term\ncapital gain for the taxable year over its net\nlong-term capital loss, if any. In the case of\nShares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as an interest-related\ndividend or as a short-term capital gain\ndividend. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact\ntheir intermediaries with respect to the\napplication of these rules to their accounts.\n\nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold\nShares comply with IRS requirements that will\ngenerally require them to report information\nregarding U.S. persons investing in, or\nholding accounts with, such entities, a 30%\nwithholding tax may apply to Fund\ndistributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the\nwithholding described in this paragraph under\nan applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the\nterms of such agreement.\n\nBACKUP WITHHOLDING. The Fund will be required\nin certain cases to withhold (as \u201cbackup\nwithholding\u201d) on amounts payable to any\nshareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S.\n                      49                      \nresident alien). The backup withholding rate\nis currently 24%. Backup withholding will not\nbe applied to payments that have been subject\nto the 30% withholding tax on shareholders who\nare neither citizens nor permanent residents\nof the U.S.\n\nCREATION UNITS. An Authorized Participant who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units\ngenerally will recognize a gain or a loss. The\ngain or loss will be equal to the difference\nbetween the market value of the Creation Units\nat the time and the sum of the exchanger\u2019s\naggregate basis in the securities surrendered\nplus the amount of cash paid for such Creation\nUnits. A person who redeems Creation Units\nwill generally recognize a gain or loss equal\nto the difference between the exchanger\u2019s\nbasis in the Creation Units and the sum of the\naggregate market value of any securities\nreceived plus the amount of any cash received\nfor such Creation Units. The IRS, however, may\nassert that a loss realized upon an exchange\nof securities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing\n\u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the basis that there has\nbeen no significant change in economic\nposition.\n\nAny gain or loss realized upon a creation of\nCreation Units will be treated as capital gain\nor loss if the Authorized Participant holds\nthe securities exchanged therefor as capital\nassets, and otherwise will be ordinary income\nor loss. Similarly, any gain or loss realized\nupon a redemption of Creation Units will be\ntreated as capital gain or loss if the\nAuthorized Participant holds the Shares\ncomprising the Creation Units as capital\nassets, and otherwise will be ordinary income\nor loss. Any capital gain or loss realized\nupon the creation of Creation Units will\ngenerally be treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss if the securities exchanged for such\nCreation Units have been held for more than\none year, and otherwise will be short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon the redemption of Creation Units\nwill generally be treated as long-term capital\ngain or loss if the Shares comprising the\nCreation Units have been held for more than\none year, and otherwise, will generally be\nshort-term capital gain or loss. Any capital\nloss realized upon a redemption of Creation\nUnits held for six (6) months or less will be\ntreated as a long-term capital loss to the\nextent of any amounts treated as distributions\nto the applicable Authorized Participant of\nlong-term capital gains with respect to the\nCreation Units (including any amounts credited\nto the Authorized Participant as undistributed\ncapital gains).\n\nThe Fund has the right to reject an order for\nCreation Units if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Shares\nso ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding\nshares of the Fund and if, pursuant to section\n351 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund\nwould have a basis in any deposit securities\ndifferent from the market value of such\nsecurities on the date of deposit. The Fund\nalso has the right to require information\nnecessary to determine beneficial Share\nownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. If the Fund does issue Creation\nUnits to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding Shares, the purchaser (or a group\nof purchasers) may not recognize gain or loss\nupon the exchange of securities for Creation\nUnits.\n\nIf the Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it\nmay bear additional costs and recognize more\ncapital gains than it would if it redeems\nCreation Units in kind.\n\nPersons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units\nshould consult their own tax advisors with\nrespect to the tax treatment of any creation\nor redemption transaction.\n\nCERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\nUnder promulgated Treasury regulations, if a\nshareholder recognizes a loss on disposition\nof the Fund\u2019s shares of $2 million or more for\nan individual shareholder or $10 million or\nmore for a corporate shareholder (or certain\ngreater amounts over a combination of years),\nthe shareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A\nshareholder who fails to make the required\ndisclosure to the IRS may be subject to\nadverse tax consequences, including\nsignificant penalties. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer\u2019s treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisers\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances.\n\nThe foregoing discussion is a summary only and\nis not intended as a substitute for careful\ntax planning. Purchasers of Shares should\nconsult their own tax advisors as to the tax\nconsequences of investing in such Shares,\nincluding under state, local and other tax\nlaws. Finally, the foregoing discussion is\nbased on applicable provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code, regulations, judicial authority\nand administrative interpretations in effect\non the date hereof. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.\n                      50                      \n                                              \n      CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES      \nThe Fund issues Shares of beneficial interest,\npar value $.01 per Share. The Board may\ndesignate additional funds.\n\nEach Share issued by the Trust has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of the corresponding\nseries of the Trust. Shares have no\npreemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable.\nEach Share is entitled to participate equally\nin dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to the Fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of the Fund on\nliquidation.\n\nEach Share has one vote with respect to\nmatters upon which a shareholder vote is\nrequired consistent with the requirements of\nthe 1940 Act and the rules promulgated\nthereunder. Shares of all series of the Trust\n(\u201cFunds\u201d) vote together as a single class\nexcept that if the matter being voted on\naffects only a particular fund it will be\nvoted on only by that fund and if a matter\naffects a particular fund differently from\nother Funds, that fund will vote separately on\nsuch matter. Under Massachusetts law, the\nTrust is not required to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust\nis not to hold an annual meeting of\nshareholders unless required to do so under\nthe 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights for the election of Trustees.\nUnder Massachusetts law, Trustees of the Trust\nmay be removed by vote of the shareholders.\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, shareholders of a\nbusiness trust may, under certain\ncircumstances, be held personally liable as\npartners for obligations of the Trust.\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an\nexpress disclaimer of shareholder liability\nfor acts or obligations of the Trust, requires\nthat Trust obligations include such\ndisclaimer, and provides for indemnification\nand reimbursement of expenses out of the\nTrust\u2019s property for any shareholder held\npersonally liable for the obligations of the\nTrust. Thus, the risk of a shareholder\nincurring financial loss on account of\nshareholder liability is limited to\ncircumstances in which the Trust itself would\nbe unable to meet its obligations. Given the\nabove limitations on shareholder personal\nliability, and the nature of the Fund\u2019s assets\nand operations, the risk to shareholders of\npersonal liability is believed to be remote.\n\nShareholder inquiries may be made by writing\nto the Trust, c/o the Distributor, State\nStreet Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC\nat One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts\n02210.\n                                              \n     COUNSEL AND INDEPENDENT REGISTERED       \n     PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                   \n                                              \nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 1111 Pennsylvania\nAvenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, serves as\ncounsel to the Trust.

The ability of the Trust\nto effect in-kind redemptions within two\nBusiness Days of receipt of a redemption\nrequest is subject to, among other things, the\ncondition that, within the time period from\nthe date of the request to the date of\ndelivery of the securities, there are no days\nthat are local market holidays on the relevant\nBusiness Days. For every occurrence of one or\nmore intervening holidays in the local market\nthat are not holidays observed in the United\nStates, the redemption settlement cycle may be\nextended by the number of such intervening\nlocal holidays. In addition to holidays, other\nunforeseeable closings in a foreign market due\nto emergencies may also prevent the Trust from\ndelivering securities within two Business\nDays.\n\nThe securities delivery cycles currently\npracticable for transferring portfolio\nsecurities to redeeming investors, coupled\nwith local market holiday schedules, may\nrequire a delivery process longer than the\nstandard settlement period. In certain\ncircumstances during the calendar year, the\nsettlement period may be greater than seven\ncalendar days.\n                                              \n             FINANCIAL STATEMENTS             \n                                              \nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any financial information to report for\nthe Trust\u2019s June 30, 2021 fiscal year end.\n\nSPDRSERIESMARAXSAI\n                      51                      \n                                              \n                  APPENDIX A                  \n                                              \n              SPDR\u00aeSeries Trust               \n                                              \n                                              \n           SPDR\u00aeIndex Shares Funds            \n                                              \n                                              \n              SSGA Active Trust               \n                                              \n   (each, a \u201cTrust,\u201d and, collectively, the   \n                  \u201cTrusts\u201d)                   \n                                              \n      PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES      \n                                              \nThe Boards of Trustees of the Trusts have\nadopted the following policy and procedures\nwith respect to voting proxies relating to\nportfolio securities held by the Trusts\u2019\ninvestment portfolios.\n                           \n  1.  Proxy Voting Policy  \n                           \nThe policy of each Trust is to delegate the\nresponsibility for voting proxies relating to\nportfolio securities held by the Trusts to\nSSGA Funds Management, Inc.

Fiduciary Duty  \n                      \nThe right to vote proxies with respect to\nportfolio securities held by each Trust is an\nasset of the Trusts. The Adviser acts as a\nfiduciary of the Trusts and must vote proxies\nin a manner consistent with the best interest\nof the Trusts and the Funds\u2019 shareholders.\n                               \n  3.

We            \n              understand that regulatory      \n              requirements and investor       \n              expectations relating to        \n              governance practices and        \n              engagement activities differ    \n              from country to country. As a   \n              result, we engage with          \n              issuers, regulators, or a       \n              combination of the two          \n              depending upon the market. We   \n              are also a member of various    \n              investor associations that      \n              seek to address broader         \n              corporate governance-related    \n              policy at the country level,    \n              as well as issuer-specific      \n              concerns at a company level.    \n              The State Street Global         \n              Advisors Asset Stewardship      \n              Team may collaborate with       \n              members of the Active           \n              Fundamental and various other   \n              investment teams to engage      \n              with companies on corporate     \n              governance issues and to        \n              address any specific concerns.  \n              This facilitates our            \n              comprehensive approach to       \n              information gathering as it     \n              relates to shareholder items    \n              that are to be voted upon at    \n              upcoming shareholder meetings.  \n              We also conduct                 \n              issuer-specific engagements     \n              with companies, covering        \n              various corporate governance    \n              and sustainability-related      \n              topics outside of proxy         \n              season.                         \n              The Asset Stewardship Team      \n              employs a blend of              \n              quantitative and qualitative    \n              research, analysis and data in  \n              order to support screens that   \n              identify issuers where active   \n              engagement may be necessary to  \n              protect and promote             \n              shareholder value. Issuer       \n              engagement may also be event    \n              driven, focusing on             \n              issuer-specific corporate       \n              governance, sustainability      \n              concerns, or more broad         \n              industry-related trends. We     \n              also consider the size of our   \n              total position of the issuer    \n              in question and/or the          \n              potential negative governance,  \n              performance profile, and        \n              circumstance at hand. As a      \n              result, we believe issuer       \n              engagement can take many forms  \n              and be triggered by numerous    \n              circumstances. The following    \n              approaches represent how we     \n              define engagement methods:      \n              We use screening tools          \n              designed to capture a mix of    \n              company-specific data,          \n  Active      including governance and        \n              sustainability profiles, to     \n              help us focus our voting and    \n              engagement activity.            \n              We will actively seek direct    \n              dialogue with the board and     \n              management of companies that    \n              we have identified through our  \n              screening processes. Such       \n              engagements may lead to         \n              further monitoring to ensure    \n              that the company improves its   \n              governance or sustainability    \n              practices. In these cases, the  \n              engagement process represents   \n              the most meaningful             \n              opportunity for us to protect   \n              long-term shareholder value     \n              from excessive risk due to      \n              poor governance and             \n              sustainability practices.       \n              Reactive engagement is          \n              initiated by the issuers. We    \n              routinely discuss specific      \n              voting issues and items with    \n  Reactive    the issuer community. Reactive  \n              engagement is an opportunity    \n              to address not only voting      \n              items, but also a wide range    \n              of governance and               \n              sustainability issues.          \n              We have established an          \n              engagement protocol that        \n              further describes our approach  \n              to issuer engagement.           \n                                              \n                     B-3                      \n                                              \n                        Assessing the         \n                        effectiveness of our  \n                        issuer engagement     \n                        process is often      \n                        difficult. In order   \n                        to limit the          \n                        subjectivity of       \n                        effectiveness         \n                        measurement, we       \n                        actively seek issuer  \n                        feedback and monitor  \n                        the actions issuers   \n                        take post-engagement  \n                        in order to identify  \n                        tangible changes.     \n                        Thus, we are able to  \n                        establish indicators  \n  Measurement           to gauge how issuers  \n                        respond to our        \n                        concerns and to what  \n                        degree these          \n                        responses satisfy     \n                        our requests. It is   \n                        also important to     \n                        note that successful  \n                        engagement activity   \n                        can be measured over  \n                        differing time        \n                        periods depending     \n                        upon the relevant     \n                        facts and             \n                        circumstances.        \n                        Engagements can last  \n                        as briefly as a       \n                        single meeting or     \n                        span multiple years.  \n                        Depending upon the    \n                        issue and whether     \n                        the engagement        \n                        activity is           \n                        reactive, recurring,  \n                        or active,            \n                        engagement with       \n                        issuers can take the  \n                        form of written       \n                        communication,        \n                        conference calls, or  \n                        in-person meetings.   \n                        We believe active     \n                        engagement is best    \n                        conducted directly    \n                        with company          \n                        management or board   \n                        members.              \n                        Collaborative         \n                        engagement, where     \n                        multiple              \n                        shareholders          \n                        communicate with      \n                        company               \n                        representatives, can  \n                        serve as a potential  \n                        forum for issues      \n                        that are not          \n                        identified by us as   \n                        requiring active      \n                        engagement.

Further, good     \n  corporate                                   \n  governance necessitates the existence of    \n  effective                                   \n  internal controls and risk management       \n  systems,                                    \n  which should be governed by the board.      \n  State Street Global Advisors believes that  \n  a well                                      \n  constituted board of directors with a good  \n  balance                                     \n  of skills, expertise, and independence      \n  provides                                    \n  the foundations for a well governed         \n  company. We                                 \n  view board quality as a measure of          \n  director                                    \n  independence, director succession           \n  planning, board                             \n  diversity, evaluations and refreshment,     \n  and                                         \n  company governance practices. We vote for   \n  the                                         \n  (re-)election of directors on a             \n  case-by-case basis                          \n  after considering various factors           \n  including board                             \n  quality, general market practice, and       \n  availability                                \n  of information on director skills and       \n  expertise.                                  \n  In our analysis of boards, we consider      \n  whether                                     \n  board members have adequate skills to       \n  provide                                     \n  effective oversight of corporate strategy,  \n  operations, and risks, including            \n  environmental and                           \n  social issues. Boards should also have a    \n  regular                                     \n  evaluation process in place to assess the   \n  effectiveness of the board and the skills   \n  of board                                    \n  members to address issues, such as          \n  emerging risks,                             \n  changes to corporate strategy, and          \n  diversification                             \n  of operations and geographic footprint.     \n  We may also consider board performance and  \n  directors who appear to be remiss in the    \n  performance of their oversight              \n  responsibilities                            \n  when analyzing their suitability for        \n  reappointment                               \n  (e.g. fraud, criminal wrongdoing and        \n  breach of                                   \n  fiduciary responsibilities).                \n  Board Independence                          \n  In principle, we believe independent        \n  directors are                               \n  crucial to corporate governance and help    \n  management establish sound ESG policies     \n  and                                         \n  practices. A sufficiently independent       \n  board will                                  \n  most effectively monitor management and     \n  perform                                     \n  oversight functions necessary to protect    \n  shareholder interests. We expect boards of  \n  ASX 300                                     \n  and New Zealand listed companies to be      \n  comprised                                   \n  of at least a majority of independent       \n  directors.                                  \n  At all other Australian listed companies,   \n  we                                          \n  expect boards to be comprised of at least   \n  one-third independent directors.            \n  Our broad criteria for director             \n  independence in                             \n  Australia and New Zealand include factors   \n  such as:                                    \n  \u2022 Participation in related-party            \n  transactions and                            \n  other business relations with the company   \n  \u2022\u2003\u2002\u200aEmployment history with company         \n  \u2022\u2003\u2002\u200aRelations with controlling              \n  shareholders                                \n  Family ties with any of the company\u2019s       \n  advisers,                                   \n  directors, or senior employees              \n  While we are generally supportive of        \n  having the                                  \n  roles of chairman and CEO separated in the  \n  Australian and New Zealand markets, we      \n  assess the                                  \n  division of responsibilities between        \n  chairman and                                \n  CEO on a case-by-case basis, giving         \n  consideration                               \n  to factors such as company-specific         \n  circumstances,                              \n  overall level of independence on the board  \n  and                                         \n  general corporate governance standards in   \n  the                                         \n  company.

We may    \n                  oppose proposals to         \n                  increase the ceiling if     \n                  there has been corporate    \n                  malfeasance or sustained    \n                  poor performance.           \n                  Annual Bonuses for          \n                  Directors/Statutory         \n                  Auditors                    \n                  In Japan, since there are   \n                  no legal requirements that  \n                  mandate companies to seek   \n                  shareholder approval        \n                  before awarding a bonus,    \n                  we believe that existing    \n                  shareholder approval of     \n                  the bonus should be         \n                  considered best practice.   \n                  As a result, we support     \n                  management proposals on     \n                  executive compensation      \n                  where there is a strong     \n                  relationship between        \n                  executive pay and           \n                  performance over a          \n                  five-year period.           \n                  Retirement Bonuses for      \n                  Directors/Statutory         \n                  Auditors                    \n                  Retirement bonuses make up  \n                  a sizeable portion of       \n                  directors\u2019 and auditors\u2019    \n                  lifetime compensation and   \n                  are based upon board        \n                  tenure. While many          \n                  companies in Japan have     \n                  abolished this practice,    \n                  there remain many           \n                  proposals seeking           \n                  shareholder approval for    \n                  the total amounts paid to   \n                  directors and statutory     \n                  auditors as a whole. In     \n                  general, we support these   \n                  payments unless the         \n                  recipient is an outsider    \n                  or in instances where the   \n                  amount is not disclosed.    \n                                              \n                     B-48                     \n                                              \n                         Stock Plans          \n                         Most option plans    \n                         in Japan are         \n                         conservative,        \n                         particularly at      \n                         large companies.     \n                         Japanese corporate   \n                         law requires         \n                         companies to         \n                         disclose the         \n                         monetary value of    \n                         the stock options    \n                         for directors        \n                         and/or statutory     \n                         auditors.

The                              \n  audit committee is responsible for          \n  monitoring the                              \n  integrity of the financial statements of    \n  the                                         \n  company, the appointment of external        \n  auditors,                                   \n  auditor qualifications and independence,    \n  and                                         \n  effectiveness and resource levels.          \n  Similarly,                                  \n  executive pay is an important aspect of     \n  corporate                                   \n  governance, and it should be determined by  \n  the                                         \n  board of directors. We expect companies to  \n  have                                        \n  remuneration committees to provide          \n  independent                                 \n  oversight over executive pay.

Boards     \n  should                                      \n  also have a regular evaluation process in   \n  place to                                    \n  assess the effectiveness of the board and   \n  the                                         \n  skills of board members to address issues   \n  such as                                     \n  emerging risks, changes to corporate        \n  strategy, and                               \n  diversification of operations and           \n  geographic                                  \n  footprint. The nomination committee is      \n  responsible                                 \n  for evaluating and reviewing the balance    \n  of                                          \n  skills, knowledge, and experience of the    \n  board. It                                   \n  also ensures that adequate succession       \n  plans are in                                \n  place for directors and the CEO. We may     \n  vote                                        \n  against the re-election of members of the   \n  nomination committee if, over time, the     \n  board has                                   \n  failed to address concerns over board       \n  structure or                                \n  succession.                                 \n  Poorly structured executive compensation    \n  plans                                       \n  pose increasing reputational risk to        \n  companies.                                  \n  Ongoing high level of dissent against a     \n  company\u2019s                                   \n  compensation proposals may indicate that    \n  the                                         \n  company is not receptive to investor        \n  concerns.

Hybrid securities may also be    \n  *  subject to contractually allowable       \n     write-downs of principal that could      \n     result in impairment. Together with the  \n     hybrid indicator, the long-term          \n     obligation rating assigned to a hybrid   \n     security is an expression of the         \n     relative credit risk associated with     \n     that security.                           \n                                              \nFitch Ratings Ltd.\u2019s (\u201cFitch\u201d) Corporate\nFinance Obligations \u2013 Long-Term Ratings:\n\nAAA: Highest Credit Quality. \u2018AAA\u2019 ratings\ndenote the lowest expectation of credit risk.\nThey are assigned only in cases of\nexceptionally strong capacity for payment of\nfinancial commitments.

Indemnification  \n                             \nPursuant to Section 5.3 of the Registrant\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust and\nunder Section 4.9 of the Registrant\u2019s By-Laws,\nthe Trust will indemnify any person who is, or\nhas been, a Trustee, officer, employee or\nagent of the Trust against all expenses\nreasonably incurred or paid by him/her in\nconnection with any claim, action, suit or\nproceeding in which he/she becomes involved as\na party or otherwise by virtue of his/her\nbeing or having been a Trustee, officer,\nemployee or agent and against amounts paid or\nincurred by him/her in the settlement thereof,\nif he/she acted in good faith and in a manner\nhe/she reasonably believed to be in or not\nopposed to the best interests of the Trust,\nand, with respect to any criminal action or\nproceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe\nhis/her conduct was unlawful. In addition,\nindemnification is permitted only if it is\ndetermined that the actions in question did\nnot render him/her liable by reason of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in\nthe performance of his/her duties or by reason\nof reckless disregard of his/her obligations\nand duties to the Registrant. The Registrant\nmay also advance money for litigation expenses\nprovided that Trustees, officers, employees\nand/or agents give their undertakings to repay\nthe Registrant unless their conduct is later\ndetermined to permit indemnification.\n\nPursuant to Section 5.2 of the Registrant\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust, no\nTrustee, officer, employee or agent of the\nRegistrant shall be liable for any action or\nfailure to act, except in the case of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or\nreckless disregard of duties to the\nRegistrant. Pursuant to paragraph 9 of the\nRegistrant\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement,\nthe Adviser shall not be liable for any action\nor failure to act, except in the case of\nwillful misfeasance, bad faith or gross\nnegligence or reckless disregard of duties to\nthe Registrant.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liability\narising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the\n\u201cAct\u201d) may be permitted to directors, officers\nand controlling persons of the Registrant\npursuant to the provisions of Rule 484 under\nthe Act, or otherwise, the Registrant has been\nadvised that in the opinion of the SEC such\nindemnification is against public policy as\nexpressed in the Act and is, therefore,\nunenforceable. In the event that a claim for\nindemnification against such liabilities\n(other than the payment by the Registrant of\nexpenses incurred or paid by a director,\nofficer or controlling person of the\nRegistrant in the successful defense of any\naction, suit or proceeding) is asserted by\nsuch director, officer or controlling person\nin connection with the securities being\nregistered, the Registrant will, unless in the\nopinion of its counsel the matter has been\nsettled by controlling precedent, submit to a\ncourt of appropriate jurisdiction the question\nwhether such indemnification by it is against\npublic policy as expressed in the Act and will\nbe governed by the final adjudication of such\nissue.\n\nThe Registrant hereby undertakes that it will\napply the indemnification provision of its By-\nLaws in a manner consistent with Release 11330\nof the SEC under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), so long as\nthe interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i)\nthereunder remains in effect.\n\nThe Registrant maintains insurance on behalf\nof any person who is or was a Trustee,\nofficer, employee or agent of the Registrant,\nor who is or was serving at the request of the\nRegistrant as a trustee, director, officer,\nemployee or agent of another trust or\ncorporation, against any liability asserted\nagainst him/her and incurred by him/her or\narising out of his/her position. However, in\nno event will the Registrant maintain\ninsurance to indemnify any such person for any\nact for which the Registrant itself is not\npermitted to indemnify him/her.\n                      5                       \n                                              \n  Item\u00a031.
