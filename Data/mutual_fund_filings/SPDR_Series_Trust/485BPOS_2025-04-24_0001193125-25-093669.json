You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.30%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.30%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $31        $97    $169     $381  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 25 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg EM Local Currency Government Diversified Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which\nmeans that the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the Fund's investment\nadviser, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the\nIndex in approximately the same proportions as the Index,\nas determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for\n\n1\n\ncash management purposes. In seeking to track the Index,\nthe Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may also enter into forward currency\nexchange contracts for hedging and/or investment purposes.\nSwaps and futures contracts may be used by the Fund in\nseeking performance that corresponds to its Index and in\nmanaging cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of the fixed-rate local currency sovereign debt\nof emerging market countries. The Index includes government\nbonds issued by investment grade and non-investment grade\ncountries outside the United States, in local currencies,\nthat have a remaining maturity of one year or more and are\nrated B3/B-/B- or higher using the middle rating of Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch\nRatings, Inc., respectively. Each of the component\nsecurities in the Index is a constituent of the Bloomberg\nEM Local Currency Government Index. As of February 28,\n2025, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies\nlocated in Asia, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of February 28, 2025, there were approximately 698\nsecurities in the Index. The Index is calculated by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (as defined below) using a\nmodified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d methodology. This design\nensures that each constituent country within the Index is\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with its percentage\nwith respect to the total market capitalization of the\nIndex. Component securities in each constituent country are\nrepresented in a proportion consistent with their\npercentage relative to the other component securities in\nthe constituent country. The securities in the Index are\nupdated on the last business day of each month. The Index\nis sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or\nthe Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition\nof the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, trade policy changes\nor disputes, the threat or actual imposition of tariffs,\nnatural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or\nother public health issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The values of debt securities may increase\nor decrease as a result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or\nperceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors\nor liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or\ninterest payments, or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially slower\nthan originally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities to decrease, an adverse impact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. During periods when\ninterest rates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may\nlose money on an operating basis). To the extent that\ninterest rates fall, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially faster than originally anticipated.\nIf the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before\nexpected, the prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates.\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, the income\nreceived by the Fund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the values of debt\nsecurities of longer durations. Returns on investments in\ndebt securities could trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity securities.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities are subject\nto political, regulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less information\npublicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial report standards\ncomparable to those in the United States. Further, such\nentities and/or their securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls; expropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater market volatility; differing\nsecurities 2 market structures; higher transaction costs;\nand various administrative difficulties, such as delays in\nclearing and settling portfolio transactions or in\nreceiving payment of dividends. To the extent underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that\nare closed when the exchange on which the Fund's shares\ntrade is open, there may be deviations between the current\nprice of an underlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed foreign market.\nThese deviations could result in the Fund experiencing\npremiums or discounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Securities traded on foreign\nmarkets may be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities\ntraded domestically. Foreign governments may impose\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys securities\ndenominated in a foreign currency, there are special risks\nsuch as changes in currency exchange rates and the risk\nthat a foreign government could regulate foreign exchange\ntransactions. In addition, to the extent investments are\nmade in a limited number of countries, events in those\ncountries will have a more significant impact on the Fund.\nEmerging Markets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging\nmarkets include, among others, greater political and\neconomic instability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities markets,\nincreased potential for market manipulation, possible trade\nbarriers, currency transfer restrictions, a more limited\nnumber of potential buyers and issuers, an emerging market\ncountry's dependence on revenue from particular commodities\nor international aid, less governmental supervision and\nregulation, unavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial reporting standards,\nand less developed legal systems. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargoes, and acts of war. The securities\nof emerging market companies may trade less frequently and\nin smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections may limit\nvery significantly the liquidity of securities of certain\ncompanies in a particular country or geographic region, or\nof all companies in the country or region. The Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any\ntime, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Sovereign Debt\nObligations Risk: Investments in debt securities issued by\ngovernments or by government agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental entities responsible\nfor repayment may be unable or unwilling to pay interest\nand repay principal when due. Any restructuring of a\nsovereign debt obligation held by the Fund will likely have\na significant adverse effect on the value of the\nobligation. In the event of default of sovereign debt, the\nFund may be unable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral securing the\ndebt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Below\nInvestment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-quality debt\nsecurities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) are considered\npredominantly speculative, and can involve a substantially\ngreater risk of default than higher quality debt\nsecurities. Issuers of lower-quality debt securities may\nhave substantially greater risk of insolvency or bankruptcy\nthan issuers of higher-quality debt securities. They can be\nilliquid, and their values can have significant volatility\nand may decline significantly over short periods of time.\nLower-quality debt securities tend to be more sensitive to\nadverse news about the issuer, or the market or economy in\ngeneral. Currency Risk: The value of the Fund's assets may\nbe affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange\nrates, currency exchange control regulations, and delays,\nrestrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have\nsignificant volatility, and changes in the values of\nforeign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in\nsubstantial declines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Forward Currency\nContracts Risk: In a forward currency contract, the Fund\nagrees to buy in the future an amount in one currency in\nreturn for another currency, at an exchange rate determined\nat the time the contract is entered into. If currency\nexchange rates have moved against the Fund's position at\nthe time the contract is settled or closed, the Fund will\nlose money on the contract. There is no limit on the extent\nto which exchange rates may move against the Fund's\nposition. The markets for certain currencies may at times\nbecome illiquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter into\nnew forward contracts or to close out existing contracts.\nForward currency contracts 3 are entered into in the over-\nthe-counter market, and the Fund's ability to profit from a\ncontract will depend on the willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations under the contract.\nFutures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations.\nGeographic Focus Risk: The performance of a fund that\ninvests significantly in one or more countries or\ngeographic regions will be closely tied to market,\ncurrency, economic, political, environmental, or regulatory\nconditions and developments in the countries or regions in\nwhich the fund invests, and may be more volatile than the\nperformance of a fund that does not invest significantly in\nsuch countries or regions. Asia: Certain Asian economies\nhave experienced high inflation, high unemployment,\ncurrency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension\nof credit. Many Asian economies have experienced rapid\ngrowth and industrialization, and there is no assurance\nthat this growth rate will be maintained. Economic events\nin any one Asian country may have a significant economic\neffect on the entire Asian region, as well as on major\ntrading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the\nAsian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some\nor all of the economies of the countries in which the Fund\ninvests. Many Asian countries are subject to political\nrisk, including corruption and regional conflict with\nneighboring countries. In addition, many Asian countries\nare subject to social and labor risks associated with\ndemands for improved political, economic and social\nconditions. These risks, among others, may adversely affect\nthe value of the Fund's investments. Income Risk: The\nFund's income may decline due to falling interest rates or\nother factors. Issuers of securities held by the Fund may\ncall or redeem the securities during periods of falling\ninterest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to\nreinvest in securities paying lower interest rates. If an\nobligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying\nincome at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. 4\n\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market\nconditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or\nprice or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid investments and may\nbe subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the\nFund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling\nsuch investments, may be unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk: As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund\nmay hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many\nother funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively\nsmall number of issuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may affect its value\nmore than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values\nof shares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become\ndiversified for periods of time solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or\nmore component securities). Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-\nparty contract that generally obligates the parties to\nexchange payments based on a specified reference security,\nbasket of securities, security index or index component.\nSwaps can involve greater risks than direct investment in\nsecurities because swaps may be leveraged and are subject\nto counterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a counterparty's\ndefaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk\nand pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to value).\nIt may not be possible for the Fund to liquidate a swap\nposition at an advantageous time or price, which may result\nin significant losses. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio\nholdings may be valued on the basis of factors other than\nmarket quotations. This may occur more often in times of\nmarket turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple\nmethods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available. The value\nestablished for any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using a different\nmethodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. Fund\nPerformance The following bar chart and table provide an\nindication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to year and by\nshowing how the Fund's average annual returns for certain\ntime periods compare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as\n\u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a\ndesignated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and\nsold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market\nprices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium)\nor less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as\na 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement\nmay be taxable to you. Some distributions may be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes. Payments\nto Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or\nother financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n6\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond     \n  ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment        \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses, correspond   \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index thattracks the investment grade corporate     \n  sector of the global bond market outside of the     \n  United States.                                      \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.50%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.50%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $51       $160    $280     $628  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 13 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD \u02c3$1B: Corporate Bond\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy,\nwhich means that the Fund is not required to purchase all\nof the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a subset of the securities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nBased on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the Fund's\ninvestment adviser, either may invest the Fund's assets in\na subset of securities in the Index or may invest the\nFund's assets in substantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the same\nproportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser to\nbe in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index and\nin securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities that comprise\nthe Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are not included in\nthe Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund)\nfor cash management purposes. In seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry\nor group of industries, but only to\n\n7\n\nthe extent that the Index concentrates in a particular\nindustry or group of industries. The Fund may also enter\ninto forward currency exchange contracts for hedging and/or\ninvestment purposes. Swaps and futures contracts may be\nused by the Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to\nits Index and in managing cash flows. The Index is designed\nto be a broad based measure of the global investment grade,\nfixed rate, fixed income corporate markets outside the\nUnited States. The Index is part of the Bloomberg Global\nAggregate ex-USD Bond Index. The securities in the Index\nmust have a $1 billion USD equivalent market capitalization\noutstanding and at least 1 year remaining. Securities must\nbe fixed rate, although zero coupon bonds and step-ups are\npermitted. Additionally, securities must be rated\ninvestment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or better) using the\nmiddle rating from Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Fitch\nRatings, Inc., or S&P Global Ratings after dropping the\nhighest and lowest available ratings. If only two agencies\nrate a security, then the more conservative (lower) rating\nwill be used. If only one rating agency rates a security,\nthen that one rating will be used. Excluded from the Index\nare subordinated debt, convertible securities, floating-\nrate notes, fixed-rate perpetuals, warrants, inflation-\nlinked bonds, and structured notes. The Index is market\ncapitalization weighted and the securities in the Index are\nupdated on the last business day of each month. As of\nFebruary 28, 2025, there were approximately 939 securities\nin the Index. As of February 28, 2025, the following\ncountries were represented in the Index: Australia,\nAustria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France,\nGermany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands,\nNorway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United\nKingdom and the United States. As of February 28, 2025, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised companies located\nin Europe and the United States, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of February 28, 2025, a significant\nportion of the Fund comprised companies in the financial\nand industrial sectors, although this may change from time\nto time. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services\nLimited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, trade policy changes\nor disputes, the threat or actual imposition of tariffs,\nnatural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or\nother public health issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The values of debt securities may increase\nor decrease as a result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or\nperceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors\nor liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or\ninterest payments, or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially slower\nthan originally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities to decrease, an adverse impact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. During periods when\ninterest rates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may\nlose money on an operating basis). To the extent that\ninterest rates fall, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially faster than originally anticipated.\nIf the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before\nexpected, the prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates.\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, the income\nreceived by the Fund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the values of debt\nsecurities of longer durations. Returns on investments in\ndebt securities could trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity securities.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities are subject\nto political, regulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less information\npublicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial report standards\ncomparable to those in the United States. Further, such\nentities and/or their securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls; expropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater market volatility; differing\nsecurities 8 market structures; higher transaction costs;\nand various administrative difficulties, such as delays in\nclearing and settling portfolio transactions or in\nreceiving payment of dividends. To the extent underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that\nare closed when the exchange on which the Fund's shares\ntrade is open, there may be deviations between the current\nprice of an underlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed foreign market.\nThese deviations could result in the Fund experiencing\npremiums or discounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Securities traded on foreign\nmarkets may be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities\ntraded domestically. Foreign governments may impose\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys securities\ndenominated in a foreign currency, there are special risks\nsuch as changes in currency exchange rates and the risk\nthat a foreign government could regulate foreign exchange\ntransactions. In addition, to the extent investments are\nmade in a limited number of countries, events in those\ncountries will have a more significant impact on the Fund.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be affected\nfavorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates,\ncurrency exchange control regulations, and delays,\nrestrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have\nsignificant volatility, and changes in the values of\nforeign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in\nsubstantial declines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Financial Sector Risk:\nFinancial services companies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which may limit both the amounts\nand types of loans and other financial commitments they can\nmake, the interest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can charge and\nthe amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost of capital\nfunds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates\nchange or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an\nadverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money markets\ngenerally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets. Certain events in the financial\nsector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in\nthe financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause\ncertain financial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Forward Currency\nContracts Risk: In a forward currency contract, the Fund\nagrees to buy in the future an amount in one currency in\nreturn for another currency, at an exchange rate determined\nat the time the contract is entered into. If currency\nexchange rates have moved against the Fund's position at\nthe time the contract is settled or closed, the Fund will\nlose money on the contract. There is no limit on the extent\nto which exchange rates may move against the Fund's\nposition. The markets for certain currencies may at times\nbecome illiquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter into\nnew forward contracts or to close out existing contracts.\nForward currency contracts are entered into in the over-\nthe-counter market, and the Fund's ability to profit from a\ncontract will depend on the willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations under the contract.\nFutures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures 9 contract\nand movements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations.\nGeographic Focus Risk: The performance of a fund that\ninvests significantly in one or more countries or\ngeographic regions will be closely tied to market,\ncurrency, economic, political, environmental, or regulatory\nconditions and developments in the countries or regions in\nwhich the fund invests, and may be more volatile than the\nperformance of a fund that does not invest significantly in\nsuch countries or regions. Europe: Developed and emerging\nmarket countries in Europe will be significantly affected\nby the fiscal and monetary controls of the Economic and\nMonetary Union of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). Changes in\nregulations on trade, decreasing imports or exports,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro and recessions\namong European countries may have a significant adverse\neffect on the economies of other European countries. In\naddition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or\nwithdraw from the EU. On January 31, 2020, the United\nKingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) formally withdrew from the EU (commonly\nknown as \u201cBrexit\u201d). An agreement between the UK and the EU\ngoverning their future trade relationship became effective\nJanuary 1, 2021, but that agreement does not include an\nagreement on financial services, and it is unlikely that\nsuch agreement will be concluded. Moreover, the UK\ngovernment has started a program of financial services law\nreform with the ultimate aim of repealing many EU financial\nservices laws that were assimilated into UK law from\nJanuary 1, 2021, and replacing them with legislation or\nrules made by the UK government or financial services\nregulators. Accordingly, uncertainty remains in certain\nareas as to the future relationship between the UK and the\nEU. Brexit has already had a significant impact on the UK,\nEurope, and global economies, and could continue to result\nin volatility and illiquidity, legal, political, economic\nand regulatory uncertainties and lower economic growth for\nthese economies that could in turn have an adverse effect\non the value of the Fund's investments. Any further exits\nfrom the EU, or the possibility of such exits, or the\nabandonment of the euro, may cause additional market\ndisruption globally and introduce new legal and regulatory\nuncertainties. In addition, a number of countries in Europe\nhave suffered terrorist attacks and additional attacks may\noccur in the future. Such attacks may cause uncertainty in\nfinancial markets and may adversely affect the performance\nof the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Income Risk:\nThe Fund's income may decline due to falling interest rates\nor other factors. Issuers of securities held by the Fund\nmay call or redeem the securities during periods of falling\ninterest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to\nreinvest in securities paying lower interest rates. If an\nobligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying\nincome at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. 10\n\nIndustrial Sector Risk: Industrial companies are affected\nby supply and demand both for their specific product or\nservice and for industrial sector products and services in\ngeneral. Government regulation, world events, exchange\nrates and economic conditions, technological developments\nand liabilities for environmental damage and general civil\nliabilities will likewise affect the performance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of\nthe industrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,\nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on resale may\nlimit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid investments\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in\nmarket value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Swaps Risk: A swap\nis a two-party contract that generally obligates the\nparties to exchange payments based on a specified reference\nsecurity, basket of securities, security index or index\ncomponent. Swaps can involve greater risks than direct\ninvestment in securities because swaps may be leveraged and\nare subject to counterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a\ncounterparty's defaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy),\ncredit risk and pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult\nto value). It may not be possible for the Fund to liquidate\na swap position at an advantageous time or price, which may\nresult in significant losses. Unconstrained Sector Risk:\nThe Fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets\nwithin one or more economic sectors or industries, which\nmay change from time to time. Greater investment focus on\none or more sectors or industries increases the potential\nfor volatility and the risk that events negatively\naffecting such sectors or industries could reduce returns,\npotentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly. Valuation Risk: Certain\nportfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors\nother than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio\nholding when market quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio holding at a point\nin time might differ from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. Fund\nPerformance The following bar chart and table provide an\nindication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to year and by\nshowing how the Fund's average annual returns for certain\ntime periods compare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Richard\nDarby-Dowman, Paul Brown, Pavel Khimchuk and Peter Spano, who are part of State Street Global Advisors\nLimited (\u201cSSGA LTD\u201d), an affiliate of the Adviser, and provide portfolio management services through a\npersonnel-sharing arrangement between the Adviser and SSGA LTD. Richard Darby-Dowman is a Vice President and\na Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Team at SSGA LTD. He joined SSGA LTD in 2006. Paul\nBrown is a Vice President and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Team at SSGA\nLTD. He joined SSGA LTD in 2013. Pavel Khimchuk is an Assistant Vice President and a Portfolio Manager in\nthe Fixed Income Beta Solutions Team at SSGA LTD. He joined SSGA LTD in 2023.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as\n\u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a\ndesignated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and\nsold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market\nprices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium)\nor less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as\na 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement\nmay be taxable to you. Some distributions may be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes.\n\n12\n\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information. 13\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF  \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment            \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses, correspond   \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index thattracks the fixed-rate local currency      \n  sovereign debt of investment grade countries        \n  outside the United States.                          \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 17 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg Global Treasury ex-US Capped Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the\nFund is not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. The Fund may also\nenter into forward currency exchange contracts for hedging\nand/or investment purposes. Futures contracts may be used\nby the Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to its\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n14\n\nThe Index is designed to track the fixed-rate local\ncurrency sovereign debt of investment grade countries\noutside the United States. The Index includes government\nbonds issued by investment grade countries outside the\nUnited States, in local currencies, that have a remaining\nmaturity of one year or more and are rated investment grade\n(Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or higher using the middle rating of\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and\nFitch Ratings, Inc., respectively). Securities included in\nthe Index may include securities that are subject to\nrestrictions on resale under the U.S. federal securities\nlaws (\u201crestricted securities\u201d). Each of the component\nsecurities in the Index is a constituent of the Bloomberg\nGlobal Treasury ex-US Index. In addition, the securities in\nthe Index must be fixed-rate and have certain minimum\namounts outstanding, depending upon the currency in which\nthe bonds are denominated. The Index is calculated by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited using a modified \u201cmarket\ncapitalization\u201d methodology. This design ensures that each\nconstituent country within the Index is represented in a\nproportion consistent with its percentage with respect to\nthe total market capitalization of the Index. Component\nsecurities in each constituent country are represented in a\nproportion consistent with their percentage relative to the\nother component securities in the constituent country. The\nsecurities in the Index are updated on the last business\nday of each month. As of February 28, 2025, a significant\nportion of the Fund comprised companies located in Europe\nand Japan, although this may change from time to time. As\nof February 28, 2025, there were approximately 1,640\nsecurities in the Index. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, trade policy changes or disputes, the\nthreat or actual imposition of tariffs, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities\nare subject to political, regulatory, and economic risks\nnot present in domestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a non-U.S. entity than\nabout a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not\nsubject to accounting, auditing, legal and financial report\nstandards comparable to those in the United States.\nFurther, such entities and/or their securities may be\nsubject to risks associated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market\nvolatility; differing securities market structures; higher\ntransaction costs; and various administrative difficulties,\nsuch as delays in clearing and settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of dividends. To the\nextent underlying securities held by the Fund trade on\nforeign exchanges that are closed when the exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an underlying\nsecurity and the last quoted price for the underlying\nsecurity on the closed foreign market. These deviations\ncould result in the Fund experiencing premiums 15 or\ndiscounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a\nforeign currency, there are special risks such as changes\nin currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Sovereign Debt\nObligations Risk: Investments in debt securities issued by\ngovernments or by government agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental entities responsible\nfor repayment may be unable or unwilling to pay interest\nand repay principal when due. Any restructuring of a\nsovereign debt obligation held by the Fund will likely have\na significant adverse effect on the value of the\nobligation. In the event of default of sovereign debt, the\nFund may be unable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral securing the\ndebt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be affected\nfavorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates,\ncurrency exchange control regulations, and delays,\nrestrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have\nsignificant volatility, and changes in the values of\nforeign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in\nsubstantial declines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Emerging Markets Risk:\nRisks of investing in emerging markets include, among\nothers, greater political and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less developed\nsecurities markets, increased potential for market\nmanipulation, possible trade barriers, currency transfer\nrestrictions, a more limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue\nfrom particular commodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation, unavailability of\ncurrency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation, nationalization, embargoes, and acts\nof war. The securities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial\nmarket corrections may limit very significantly the\nliquidity of securities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of all\ncompanies in the country or region. The Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its positions in such securities at any time,\nor at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Forward\nCurrency Contracts Risk: In a forward currency contract,\nthe Fund agrees to buy in the future an amount in one\ncurrency in return for another currency, at an exchange\nrate determined at the time the contract is entered into.\nIf currency exchange rates have moved against the Fund's\nposition at the time the contract is settled or closed, the\nFund will lose money on the contract. There is no limit on\nthe extent to which exchange rates may move against the\nFund's position. The markets for certain currencies may at\ntimes become illiquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter\ninto new forward contracts or to close out existing\ncontracts. Forward currency contracts are entered into in\nthe over-the-counter market, and the Fund's ability to\nprofit from a contract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its obligations\nunder the contract. Futures Contract Risk: A futures\ncontract is a standardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific price at\na specific future time, or cash settlement of the terms of\nthe contract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures 16 contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Geographic Focus Risk: The\nperformance of a fund that invests significantly in one or\nmore countries or geographic regions will be closely tied\nto market, currency, economic, political, environmental, or\nregulatory conditions and developments in the countries or\nregions in which the fund invests, and may be more volatile\nthan the performance of a fund that does not invest\nsignificantly in such countries or regions. Europe:\nDeveloped and emerging market countries in Europe will be\nsignificantly affected by the fiscal and monetary controls\nof the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union\n(\u201cEU\u201d). Changes in regulations on trade, decreasing imports\nor exports, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and\nrecessions among European countries may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other European\ncountries. In addition, one or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the EU. On January 31, 2020,\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d). An agreement between the UK\nand the EU governing their future trade relationship became\neffective January 1, 2021, but that agreement does not\ninclude an agreement on financial services, and it is\nunlikely that such agreement will be concluded. Moreover,\nthe UK government has started a program of financial\nservices law reform with the ultimate aim of repealing many\nEU financial services laws that were assimilated into UK\nlaw from January 1, 2021, and replacing them with\nlegislation or rules made by the UK government or financial\nservices regulators. Accordingly, uncertainty remains in\ncertain areas as to the future relationship between the UK\nand the EU. Brexit has already had a significant impact on\nthe UK, Europe, and global economies, and could continue to\nresult in volatility and illiquidity, legal, political,\neconomic and regulatory uncertainties and lower economic\ngrowth for these economies that could in turn have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. Any\nfurther exits from the EU, or the possibility of such\nexits, or the abandonment of the euro, may cause additional\nmarket disruption globally and introduce new legal and\nregulatory uncertainties. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist attacks and\nadditional attacks may occur in the future. Such attacks\nmay cause uncertainty in financial markets and may\nadversely affect the performance of the issuers to which\nthe Fund has exposure. Japan: The growth of Japan's economy\nhas historically lagged that of its Asian neighbors and\nother major developed economies. The Japanese economy is\nheavily dependent on international trade and has been\nadversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist\nmeasures, competition from emerging economies and the\neconomic conditions of its trading partners. China has\nbecome an important trading partner with Japan, yet the\ncountries' political relationship has become strained.\nShould political tension increase, it could adversely\naffect the economy, especially the export sector, and\ndestabilize the region as a whole. Japan also remains\nheavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity\nprices could therefore have a negative impact on the\neconomy. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times\nand any increase in its value may cause a decline in\nexports that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has,\nin the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt\nto maintain or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese\nintervention in the currency markets could cause the value\nof the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could\ncause losses to investors. Japan has an aging workforce and\nhas experienced a significant population decline in recent\nyears. Japan's labor market appears to be undergoing\nfundamental structural changes, as a labor market\ntraditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to\nmeet the need for increased labor mobility, which may\nadversely affect Japan's economic competitiveness. Natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons or\ntsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and\ncould negatively affect the Japanese economy and, in turn,\nthe Fund. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or 17 at all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-Diversification\nRisk: As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than many other\nfunds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may affect its value\nmore than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values\nof shares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become\ndiversified for periods of time solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or\nmore component securities). Restricted Securities Risk: The\nFund may hold securities that have not been registered for\nsale to the public under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nThere can be no assurance that a trading market will exist\nat any time for any particular restricted security.\nLimitations on the resale of these securities may have an\nadverse effect on their marketability, and may prevent the\nFund from disposing of them promptly at reasonable prices.\nThe Fund may have to bear the expense of registering the\nsecurities for resale and the risk of substantial delays in\neffecting the registration. Also, restricted securities may\nbe difficult to value because market quotations may not be\nreadily available, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may\nbe valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. 18\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are James Kramer,\nJoanna Madden and Cynthia Moy. James Kramer is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996. Joanna Madden is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2003. Cynthia Moy is a Principal of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2007. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers)\nonly in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in\nexchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market\nprices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary\n\n19\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Some distributions may be treated as a return of\ncapital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund\nShares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its\naffiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems,\nor other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund\nover another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more\ninformation. 20\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury Bond ETF\n                                                   \n  Investment Objective                             \n  The SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International      \n  Treasury Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to          \n  provideinvestment results that, before fees and  \n  expenses, correspond generally to the price and  \n  yield performanceof an index that tracks the     \n  short-term (1-3 year remaining maturity) fixed   \n  rate, investment grade debt issuedby foreign     \n  governments of investment grade countries.       \n                                                   \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 47 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg 1-3 Year Global Treasury ex-US Capped Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the\nIndex in approximately the same proportions as the Index,\nas determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest\n\n21\n\nin cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments\n(including money market funds advised by the Adviser) for\ncash management purposes. The Fund may also enter into\nforward currency exchange contracts for hedging and/or\ninvestment purposes. Futures contracts may be used by the\nFund in seeking performance that corresponds to its Index\nand in managing cash flows. The Index is designed to\nmeasure the performance of fixed-rate local currency\nsovereign debt of investment grade countries outside the\nUnited States that have remaining maturities of one to\nthree years. The Index includes government bonds issued by\ninvestment grade countries outside the United States, in\nlocal currencies, that have remaining maturities of one to\nthree years and are rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB-\nor higher using the middle rating of Moody's Investors\nService, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc.,\nrespectively). Securities included in the Index may include\nsecurities that are subject to restrictions on resale under\nthe U.S. federal securities laws (\u201crestricted securities\u201d).\nEach of the component securities in the Index is a\nconstituent of the Bloomberg Global Treasury ex-US Index.\nIn addition, the securities in the Index must be fixed-rate\nand have certain minimum amounts outstanding, depending\nupon the currency in which the bonds are denominated. The\nIndex is calculated by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\nusing a modified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d methodology. This\ndesign ensures that each constituent country within the\nIndex is represented in a proportion consistent with its\npercentage with respect to the total market capitalization\nof the Index. Component securities in each constituent\ncountry are represented in a proportion consistent with\ntheir percentage relative to the other component securities\nin the constituent country. The securities in the Index are\nupdated on the last business day of each month. As of\nFebruary 28, 2025, a significant portion of the Fund\ncomprised companies located in Europe and Japan, although\nthis may change from time to time. As of February 28, 2025,\nthere were approximately 303 securities in the Index and\nthe dollar-weighted average maturity of the securities in\nthe Index was 1.90 years. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, trade policy changes or disputes, the\nthreat or actual imposition of tariffs, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities\nare subject to political, regulatory, and economic risks\nnot present in domestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a non-U.S. entity than\nabout a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not\nsubject to accounting, auditing, legal and financial report\nstandards comparable to those in the United States.\nFurther, such entities and/or their securities may be\nsubject to risks 22 associated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market\nvolatility; differing securities market structures; higher\ntransaction costs; and various administrative difficulties,\nsuch as delays in clearing and settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of dividends. To the\nextent underlying securities held by the Fund trade on\nforeign exchanges that are closed when the exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an underlying\nsecurity and the last quoted price for the underlying\nsecurity on the closed foreign market. These deviations\ncould result in the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities traded on foreign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a\nforeign currency, there are special risks such as changes\nin currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Sovereign Debt\nObligations Risk: Investments in debt securities issued by\ngovernments or by government agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental entities responsible\nfor repayment may be unable or unwilling to pay interest\nand repay principal when due. Any restructuring of a\nsovereign debt obligation held by the Fund will likely have\na significant adverse effect on the value of the\nobligation. In the event of default of sovereign debt, the\nFund may be unable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral securing the\ndebt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be affected\nfavorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates,\ncurrency exchange control regulations, and delays,\nrestrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have\nsignificant volatility, and changes in the values of\nforeign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in\nsubstantial declines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Emerging Markets Risk:\nRisks of investing in emerging markets include, among\nothers, greater political and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less developed\nsecurities markets, increased potential for market\nmanipulation, possible trade barriers, currency transfer\nrestrictions, a more limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue\nfrom particular commodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation, unavailability of\ncurrency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation, nationalization, embargoes, and acts\nof war. The securities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial\nmarket corrections may limit very significantly the\nliquidity of securities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of all\ncompanies in the country or region. The Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its positions in such securities at any time,\nor at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Forward\nCurrency Contracts Risk: In a forward currency contract,\nthe Fund agrees to buy in the future an amount in one\ncurrency in return for another currency, at an exchange\nrate determined at the time the contract is entered into.\nIf currency exchange rates have moved against the Fund's\nposition at the time the contract is settled or closed, the\nFund will lose money on the contract. There is no limit on\nthe extent to which exchange rates may move against the\nFund's position. The markets for certain currencies may at\ntimes become illiquid, and the Fund may be unable to enter\ninto new forward contracts or to close out existing\ncontracts. Forward currency contracts are entered into in\nthe over-the-counter market, and the Fund's ability to\nprofit from a contract will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its obligations\nunder the contract. Futures Contract Risk: A futures\ncontract is a standardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific price at\na specific future time, or cash settlement of the terms of\nthe contract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the 23 Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Geographic Focus Risk: The\nperformance of a fund that invests significantly in one or\nmore countries or geographic regions will be closely tied\nto market, currency, economic, political, environmental, or\nregulatory conditions and developments in the countries or\nregions in which the fund invests, and may be more volatile\nthan the performance of a fund that does not invest\nsignificantly in such countries or regions. Europe:\nDeveloped and emerging market countries in Europe will be\nsignificantly affected by the fiscal and monetary controls\nof the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union\n(\u201cEU\u201d). Changes in regulations on trade, decreasing imports\nor exports, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and\nrecessions among European countries may have a significant\nadverse effect on the economies of other European\ncountries. In addition, one or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the EU. On January 31, 2020,\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) formally withdrew from the EU\n(commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d). An agreement between the UK\nand the EU governing their future trade relationship became\neffective January 1, 2021, but that agreement does not\ninclude an agreement on financial services, and it is\nunlikely that such agreement will be concluded. Moreover,\nthe UK government has started a program of financial\nservices law reform with the ultimate aim of repealing many\nEU financial services laws that were assimilated into UK\nlaw from January 1, 2021, and replacing them with\nlegislation or rules made by the UK government or financial\nservices regulators. Accordingly, uncertainty remains in\ncertain areas as to the future relationship between the UK\nand the EU. Brexit has already had a significant impact on\nthe UK, Europe, and global economies, and could continue to\nresult in volatility and illiquidity, legal, political,\neconomic and regulatory uncertainties and lower economic\ngrowth for these economies that could in turn have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. Any\nfurther exits from the EU, or the possibility of such\nexits, or the abandonment of the euro, may cause additional\nmarket disruption globally and introduce new legal and\nregulatory uncertainties. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist attacks and\nadditional attacks may occur in the future. Such attacks\nmay cause uncertainty in financial markets and may\nadversely affect the performance of the issuers to which\nthe Fund has exposure. Japan: The growth of Japan's economy\nhas historically lagged that of its Asian neighbors and\nother major developed economies. The Japanese economy is\nheavily dependent on international trade and has been\nadversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist\nmeasures, competition from emerging economies and the\neconomic conditions of its trading partners. China has\nbecome an important trading partner with Japan, yet the\ncountries' political relationship has become strained.\nShould political tension increase, it could adversely\naffect the economy, especially the export sector, and\ndestabilize the region as a whole. Japan also remains\nheavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity\nprices could therefore have a negative impact on the\neconomy. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times\nand any increase in its value may cause a decline in\nexports that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has,\nin the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt\nto maintain or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese\nintervention in the currency markets could cause the value\nof the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could\ncause losses to investors. Japan has an aging workforce and\nhas experienced a significant population decline in recent\nyears. Japan's labor market appears to be undergoing\nfundamental structural changes, as a labor market\ntraditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to\nmeet the need for increased labor mobility, which may\nadversely affect Japan's economic competitiveness. Natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons or\ntsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and\ncould negatively affect the Japanese economy and, in turn,\nthe Fund. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than 24 that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-Diversification\nRisk: As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than many other\nfunds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may affect its value\nmore than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values\nof shares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become\ndiversified for periods of time solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or\nmore component securities). Restricted Securities Risk: The\nFund may hold securities that have not been registered for\nsale to the public under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nThere can be no assurance that a trading market will exist\nat any time for any particular restricted security.\nLimitations on the resale of these securities may have an\nadverse effect on their marketability, and may prevent the\nFund from disposing of them promptly at reasonable prices.\nThe Fund may have to bear the expense of registering the\nsecurities for resale and the risk of substantial delays in\neffecting the registration. Also, restricted securities may\nbe difficult to value because market quotations may not be\nreadily available, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may\nbe valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. 25\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are James Kramer,\nJoanna Madden and Cynthia Moy. James Kramer is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996. Joanna Madden is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2003. Cynthia Moy is a Principal of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2007. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers)\nonly in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in\nexchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market\nprices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary\n\n26\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Some distributions may be treated as a return of\ncapital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund\nShares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its\naffiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems,\nor other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund\nover another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more\ninformation. 27\n\nSPDR \u00ae FTSE International Government Inflation-Protected Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR FTSE International Government              \n  Inflation-Protected Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to  \n  provideinvestment results that, before fees and     \n  expenses, correspond generally to the price and     \n  yield performanceof an index that tracks the        \n  inflation protected sector of the global bond       \n  market outside the United States.                   \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.50%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.50%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $51       $160    $280     $628  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 12 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the FTSE\nInternational Inflation-Linked Securities Select Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the\nIndex in approximately the same proportions as the Index,\nas determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or\n\n28\n\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives, including credit\ndefault swaps and credit default index swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\ntotal return performance of inflation-linked bonds outside\nthe United States with fixed-rate coupon payments that are\nlinked to an inflation index. Inflation-protected public\nobligations of the inflation-linked government bond markets\nof developed and emerging market countries, commonly known\nin the United States as TIPS, are securities issued by such\ngovernments that are designed to provide inflation\nprotection to investors. The Index includes government debt\n(direct obligations of the issuer country) but does not\ninclude quasi-government debt or corporate debt. To be\nincluded in the Index, bonds must be linked to an inflation\nindex and (i) meet a country-specific minimum issue size,\ndepending on the currency in which the issue is\ndenominated; (ii) have a fixed-rate stated coupon; (iii)\nhave at least one year remaining to maturity at the Index\nrebalancing date; (iv) settle on or before the Index\nrebalancing date; and (v) be rated at least C by S&P Global\nRatings (\u201cS&P\u201d) or at least Ca by Moody's Investors\nService, Inc. (excluding defaulted issuers). Securities\nincluded in the Index may include securities that are\nsubject to restrictions on resale under the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws (\u201crestricted securities\u201d). The Index is a\nmarket-value weight, capped total return index, in which\nthe maximum market capitalization-based weights of each\nindividual country in the Index cannot exceed 22.5% of the\ntotal Index weight. The total market weights of countries\nwith more than 4.6% market weight in the Index cannot\ncollectively exceed 45% of the total Index weight and the\nnumber of countries with more than 4.6% market weight in\nthe Index can be no less than five. If the combined weights\nof each country with more than 4.6% market weight exceeds\n45% of the total Index weight, then the weights of those\ncountries are reduced in proportion to each country's\nmarket capitalizations until they sum to 45%, and the\nweights of the remaining smaller countries are increased in\nproportion to each country's market capitalizations by the\nsame amount. After the country weights are determined,\nconstituents within each country are assigned weights in\nproportion to their market capitalization. When an issuer\ndefaults, is assigned a D rating by S&P, or enters into\nChapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S.\n(or equivalent in its local market), its bonds remain in\nthe Index until the end of the month. The Index is\nrebalanced monthly, on the last day of the month. Countries\ncovered in the Index as of February 28, 2025 comprised:\nAustralia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France,\nGermany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland,\nSouth Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and the\nUnited Kingdom, although this may change from time to time.\nAs of February 28, 2025, a significant portion of the Fund\ncomprised companies located in Europe, the United Kingdom\nand the United States, although this may change from time\nto time. As of February 28, 2025, there were approximately\n176 securities in the Index. The Index is sponsored by FTSE\nRussell (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, trade policy changes\nor disputes, the threat or actual imposition of tariffs,\nnatural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or\nother public health issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The values of debt securities may increase\nor decrease as a result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or\nperceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors\nor liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or\ninterest payments, or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially slower\nthan originally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities to decrease, an adverse impact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. During periods when\ninterest rates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may\nlose money on an 29 operating basis). To the extent that\ninterest rates fall, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially faster than originally anticipated.\nIf the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before\nexpected, the prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates.\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, the income\nreceived by the Fund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the values of debt\nsecurities of longer durations. Returns on investments in\ndebt securities could trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity securities.\nNon-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities are subject\nto political, regulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less information\npublicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial report standards\ncomparable to those in the United States. Further, such\nentities and/or their securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls; expropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater market volatility; differing\nsecurities market structures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as delays in\nclearing and settling portfolio transactions or in\nreceiving payment of dividends. To the extent underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that\nare closed when the exchange on which the Fund's shares\ntrade is open, there may be deviations between the current\nprice of an underlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed foreign market.\nThese deviations could result in the Fund experiencing\npremiums or discounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Securities traded on foreign\nmarkets may be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities\ntraded domestically. Foreign governments may impose\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys securities\ndenominated in a foreign currency, there are special risks\nsuch as changes in currency exchange rates and the risk\nthat a foreign government could regulate foreign exchange\ntransactions. In addition, to the extent investments are\nmade in a limited number of countries, events in those\ncountries will have a more significant impact on the Fund.\nInflation-Indexed Securities Risk: The principal amount of\nan inflation-indexed security typically increases with\ninflation and decreases with deflation, as measured by a\nspecified index. It is possible that, in a period of\ndeclining inflation rates, the Fund could receive at\nmaturity less than the initial principal amount of an\ninflation-indexed security. Changes in the values of\ninflation-indexed securities may be difficult to predict,\nand it is possible that an investment in such securities\nwill have an effect different from that anticipated.\nSovereign Debt Obligations Risk: Investments in debt\nsecurities issued by governments or by government agencies\nand instrumentalities involve the risk that the\ngovernmental entities responsible for repayment may be\nunable or unwilling to pay interest and repay principal\nwhen due. Any restructuring of a sovereign debt obligation\nheld by the Fund will likely have a significant adverse\neffect on the value of the obligation. In the event of\ndefault of sovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to pursue\nlegal action against the sovereign issuer or to realize on\ncollateral securing the debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Below Investment-Grade Securities\nRisk: Lower-quality debt securities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d\nbonds) are considered predominantly speculative, and can\ninvolve a substantially greater risk of default than higher\nquality debt securities. Issuers of lower-quality debt\nsecurities may have substantially greater risk of\ninsolvency or bankruptcy than issuers of higher-quality\ndebt securities. They can be illiquid, and their values can\nhave significant volatility and may decline significantly\nover short periods of time. Lower-quality debt securities\ntend to be more sensitive to adverse news about the issuer,\nor the market or economy in general. Currency Risk: The\nvalue of the Fund's assets may be affected favorably or\nunfavorably by currency exchange rates, currency exchange\ncontrol regulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of foreign currencies.\nForeign currency exchange rates may have significant\nvolatility, and changes in the values of foreign currencies\nagainst the U.S. dollar may result in substantial declines\nin the values of the Fund's assets denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks of investing in\nemerging markets include, among others, greater political\nand economic instability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities markets,\nincreased potential for market manipulation, possible trade\nbarriers, currency transfer restrictions, a more limited\nnumber of potential buyers and issuers, an emerging market\ncountry's dependence on revenue from particular commodities\n30 or international aid, less governmental supervision and\nregulation, unavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial reporting standards,\nand less developed legal systems. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargoes, and acts of war. The securities\nof emerging market companies may trade less frequently and\nin smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections may limit\nvery significantly the liquidity of securities of certain\ncompanies in a particular country or geographic region, or\nof all companies in the country or region. The Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any\ntime, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Geographic\nFocus Risk: The performance of a fund that invests\nsignificantly in one or more countries or geographic\nregions will be closely tied to market, currency, economic,\npolitical, environmental, or regulatory conditions and\ndevelopments in the countries or regions in which the fund\ninvests, and may be more volatile than the performance of a\nfund that does not invest significantly in such countries\nor regions. Europe: Developed and emerging market countries\nin Europe will be significantly affected by the fiscal and\nmonetary controls of the Economic and Monetary Union of the\nEuropean Union (\u201cEU\u201d). Changes in regulations on trade,\ndecreasing imports or exports, changes in the exchange rate\nof the euro and recessions among European countries may\nhave a significant adverse effect on the economies of other\nEuropean countries. In addition, one or more countries may\nabandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. On January\n31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) formally withdrew from\nthe EU (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d). An agreement between\nthe UK and the EU governing their future trade relationship\nbecame effective January 1, 2021, but that agreement does\nnot include an agreement on financial services, and it is\nunlikely that such agreement will be concluded. Moreover,\nthe UK government has started a program of financial\nservices law reform with the ultimate aim of repealing many\nEU financial services laws that were assimilated into UK\nlaw from January 1, 2021, and replacing them with\nlegislation or rules made by the UK government or financial\nservices regulators. Accordingly, uncertainty remains in\ncertain areas as to the future relationship between the UK\nand the EU. Brexit has already had a significant impact on\nthe UK, Europe, and global economies, and could continue to\nresult in volatility and illiquidity, legal, political,\neconomic and regulatory uncertainties and lower economic\ngrowth for these economies that could in turn have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. Any\nfurther exits from the EU, or the possibility of such\nexits, or the abandonment of the euro, may cause additional\nmarket disruption globally and introduce new legal and\nregulatory uncertainties. In addition, a number of\ncountries in Europe have suffered terrorist attacks and\nadditional attacks may occur in the future. Such attacks\nmay cause uncertainty in financial markets and may\nadversely affect the performance of the issuers to which\nthe Fund has exposure. United Kingdom: The United Kingdom\nhas one of the largest economies in Europe, and the United\nStates and other European countries are substantial trading\npartners of the United Kingdom. As a result, the British\neconomy may be impacted by changes to the economic\ncondition of the United States and other European\ncountries. The British economy relies heavily on the export\nof financial services to the United States and other\nEuropean countries and, therefore, a prolonged slowdown in\nthe financial services sector may have a negative impact on\nthe British economy. Continued governmental involvement or\ncontrol in certain sectors may stifle competition in\ncertain sectors or cause adverse effects on economic\ngrowth. In the past, the UK has been a target of terrorism.\nActs of terrorism in the UK or against British interests\nabroad may cause uncertainty in the British financial\nmarkets and adversely affect the performance of the issuers\nto which the Fund has exposure. On January 31, 2020, the\nUnited Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) formally withdrew from the European\nUnion (\u201cEU\u201d) (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d). An agreement\nbetween the UK and the EU governing their future trade\nrelationship became effective January 1, 2021, but that\nagreement does not include an agreement on financial\nservices, and it is unlikely that such agreement will be\nconcluded. Moreover, the UK government has started a\nprogram of financial services law reform with the ultimate\naim of repealing many EU financial services laws that were\nassimilated into UK law from January 1, 2021, and replacing\nthem with legislation or rules made by the UK government or\nfinancial services regulators. Accordingly, uncertainty\nremains in certain areas as to the future relationship\nbetween the UK and the EU. Brexit has already had a\nsignificant impact on the UK, Europe, and global economies,\nand could continue to result in volatility and illiquidity,\nlegal, political, economic and regulatory uncertainties and\nlower economic growth for these economies that could in\nturn have an adverse effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. Any further exits from the EU, or the\npossibility of such exits, or the abandonment of the euro,\nmay cause additional market disruption globally and\nintroduce new legal and regulatory uncertainties. 31 Income\nRisk: The Fund's income may decline due to falling interest\nrates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the\nFund may call or redeem the securities during periods of\nfalling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying lower interest\nrates. If an obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-Diversification\nRisk: As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than many other\nfunds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may affect its value\nmore than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values\nof shares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become\ndiversified for periods of time solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or\nmore component securities). Restricted Securities Risk: The\nFund may hold securities that have not been registered for\nsale to the public under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nThere can be no assurance that a trading market will exist\nat any time for any particular restricted security.\nLimitations on the resale of these securities may have an\nadverse effect on their marketability, and may prevent the\nFund from disposing of them promptly at reasonable prices.\nThe Fund may have to bear the expense of registering the\nsecurities for resale and the risk of substantial delays in\neffecting the registration. Also, restricted securities may\nbe difficult to value because market quotations may not be\nreadily available, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract that\ngenerally obligates the parties to exchange payments based\non a specified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve\ngreater risks than direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk\n(e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be\npossible for the Fund to liquidate a swap position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. 32\n\nValuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to\nvalue a portfolio holding when market quotations are not\nreadily available. The value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from what would be\nproduced using a different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are\nvalued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the\nnext than if market quotations were used. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out\na portfolio position for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a\nloss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at\na discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table\nprovide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund\nby showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns\nfor certain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the\nFund will perform in the future. Updated performance\ninformation is available by calling 1-866-787-2257 or\nvisiting our website at https://www.ssga.com .\n\nAnnual Total Returns (years ended 12/31)\n                                                   \n                            Returns  Quarter/Year  \n  Highest Quarterly Return  9.81%    Q4 2023       \n  Lowest Quarterly Return   -13.99%  Q2 2022       \n                                                   \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods ended 12/31/24) The after-tax returns presented in the table below\nare calculated using highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the\nimpact of state and local taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective February 12, 2016 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the DB Global Government ex-U.S. Inflation-Linked Bond\nCapped Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the FTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities Select\nIndex, consistent with a change in the Fund's principal investment strategy to track the performance of the\ncurrent index. Performance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date is therefore based on the\nFund's investment strategy to track the Previous Benchmark Index.\n                                                                                    \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                 -8.86%   -2.74%     -0.66%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 -9.96%   -4.32%     -1.69%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     -5.22%   -2.61%     -0.83%    \n  Fund Shares                                                                       \n  FTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities                                    \n  Select Index/DB Global Government                                                 \n  ex-U.S.Inflation-Linked Bond Capped                 -8.33%   -2.06%     -0.05%    \n  Index1,2(reflects no deduction for fees, expenses                                 \n  or taxes)                                                                         \n  Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no  -1.69%   -1.96%     0.15%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                            \n                                                                                    \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the Index for periods beginning on the Benchmark Index Change Date and the\nPrevious Benchmark Index for periods prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date. 2 Prior to May 31, 2018, the\nFTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities Select Index was named the Citi International Inflation-\nLinked Securities Select Index. Portfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment\nadviser to the Fund.\n\n33\n\nPortfolio Managers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are\nJames Kramer, Cynthia Moy and Joanna Madden. James Kramer is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996. Cynthia Moy is a\nPrincipal of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2007. Joanna Madden is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed\nIncome Beta Solutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2003. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national\nsecurities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Some\ndistributions may be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary\n(such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your\nsalesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 34 Additional Strategies Information Principal Strategies\nGeneral . Please see each Fund's \u201cThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund Summaries\u201d\nabove for a discussion of each Fund's principal investment strategies. A Fund may invest in various types of\nsecurities and engage in various investment techniques which are not the principal focus of the Fund and\ntherefore are not described in this Prospectus. These securities, techniques and practices, together with\ntheir risks, are described in the Statement of Additional Information (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain free\nof charge by contacting shareholder services (see the back cover of this Prospectus for the address and\nphone number). The Adviser seeks to track the performance of each Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e\n., obtain a high degree of correlation with the Index). A number of factors may affect a Fund's ability to\nachieve a high degree of correlation with its Index, and there can be no guarantee that a Fund will achieve\na high degree of correlation. For example, a Fund may not be able to achieve a high degree of correlation\nwith its Index when there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved in compiling a portfolio\nof securities to follow the Index, when a security in the Index becomes temporarily illiquid, unavailable or\nless liquid, or legal restrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from investing in a security in the Index.\nThe Adviser will utilize a sampling strategy in managing the Funds. Sampling means that the Adviser uses\nquantitative analysis to select securities, including securities in the Index, outside of the Index and\nderivatives that have a similar investment profile as the relevant Index in terms of key risk factors,\nperformance attributes and other economic characteristics. These include industry weightings, market\ncapitalization, and other financial characteristics of securities. The quantity of holdings in a Fund will\nbe based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. In addition, from time to time,\nsecurities are added to or removed from each Index. The Adviser may sell securities that are represented in\nan Index, or purchase securities that are not yet represented in an Index, in anticipation of their removal\nfrom or addition to an Index. Further, the Adviser may choose to overweight securities in an Index, purchase\nor sell securities not in an Index, or utilize various combinations of other available techniques, in\nseeking to track an Index. Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy to invest at least 80%\nof its respective net assets, plus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in investments\nsuggested by its name, measured at the time of investment. A Fund will provide shareholders with at least 60\ndays' notice prior to any change in this non-fundamental 80% investment policy. The Board of Trustees of the\nTrust (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change a Fund's investment strategy, Index and other policies without shareholder\napproval, except as otherwise indicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI. The Board may also change a Fund's\ninvestment objective without shareholder approval. Non-Principal Strategies Certain Other Investments . Each\nFund may invest in structured notes (notes on which the amount of principal repayment and interest payments\nare based on the movement of one or more specified factors such as the movement of a particular security or\nindex), swaps, options and futures contracts. Swaps, options and futures contracts and structured notes may\nbe used by a Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to its Index and in managing cash flows. Temporary\nDefensive Positions . In certain situations or market conditions, a Fund may temporarily depart from its\nnormal investment policies and strategies, provided that the alternative is consistent with the Fund's\ninvestment objective and is in the best interest of the Fund. For example, a Fund may make larger than\nnormal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure to its Index if it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . Each Fund may borrow money from a bank as permitted by the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing statute, by the rules thereunder, or by the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund, but\nonly for temporary or emergency purposes. The 1940 Act presently allows a Fund to borrow from any bank\n(including pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets (not\nincluding temporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of its total assets). A Fund may also invest in reverse\nrepurchase agreements or similar financing transactions. Consistent with a rule under the 1940 Act, a Fund\nmay treat such investments as either borrowings or derivatives 35 transactions. To the extent a Fund treats\nreverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions as borrowings, such investments will also be\nincluded in the 33 1/3% limit. Under normal circumstances, any borrowings by a Fund (including investments\nin reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions treated as borrowings) will not exceed\n10% of the Fund's total assets. Lending of Securities . Each Fund may lend its portfolio securities in an\namount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets via a securities lending program through its\nsecurities lending agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d or the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to\nbrokers, dealers and other financial institutions desiring to borrow securities to complete transactions and\nfor other purposes. A securities lending program allows a Fund to receive a portion of the income generated\nby lending its securities and investing the respective collateral. A Fund will receive collateral for each\nloaned security which is at least equal to the market value of that security, marked to market each trading\nday. To the extent a Fund receives cash collateral, as of the date of this Prospectus, the Adviser expects\nto invest such cash collateral in a fund managed by the Adviser that invests in U.S. dollar-denominated,\nshort-term, high quality debt obligations, including the following: a broad range of money market\ninstruments; certificates of deposit and time deposits of U.S. and foreign banks; commercial paper and other\nhigh quality obligations of U.S. or foreign companies; asset-backed securities; mortgage-related securities;\nrepurchase agreements; and shares of money market funds. With respect to loans that are collateralized by\ncash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. A Fund is\ncompensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee\npaid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the\nborrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. In the securities lending\nprogram, the borrower generally has the right to vote the loaned securities; however, a Fund may call loans\nto vote proxies if a material issue affecting the Fund's economic interest in the investment is to be voted\nupon. Security loans may be terminated at any time by a Fund.

                    \n38\n\nBelow Investment-Grade Securities Risk . Securities rated below investment-grade and unrated securities of\ncomparable credit quality (commonly known as \u201chigh-yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) lack strong investment-grade\ncharacteristics, are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to\nmake principal and interest payments, and are subject to greater levels of credit, liquidity and market risk\nthan higher-rated securities. They can involve a substantially greater risk of default than higher-rated\nsecurities, and their values can decline significantly over short periods of time. Issuers of lower-quality\ndebt securities may have substantially greater risk of insolvency or bankruptcy than issuers of higher-\nquality debt securities. In the event the issuer of a debt security held by a Fund defaults on its payments\nor becomes insolvent or bankrupt, the Fund may not receive the return it was promised on the investment and\ncould lose its entire investment. The lower ratings of junk bonds reflect a greater possibility that actual\nor perceived adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer or in general economic conditions, or\nan unanticipated rise in interest rates, may impair the ability of the issuer to make payments of interest\nand principal. If this were to occur, the values of such securities held by a Fund may fall substantially\nand a Fund could lose some or all of the value of its investment. Lower-quality debt securities tend to be\nmore sensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or the market or economy in general, than higher quality\ndebt securities. The market for lower quality debt securities can be less liquid than for higher quality\ndebt securities, especially during periods of recession or general market decline, which could make it\ndifficult at times for a Fund to sell certain securities at prices used in calculating a Fund's net asset\nvalue. These securities may have significant volatility. Call/Prepayment Risk . Call/prepayment risk is the\nrisk that an issuer will exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation held by a Fund earlier than\nexpected or required. This may occur, for example, when there is a decline in interest rates, and an issuer\nof bonds or preferred stock redeems the bonds or stock in order to replace them with obligations on which it\nis required to pay a lower interest or dividend rate. It may also occur when there is an unanticipated\nincrease in the rate at which mortgages or other receivables underlying mortgage- or asset-backed securities\nheld by a Fund are prepaid. In any such case, a Fund may be forced to invest the prepaid amounts in lower-\nyielding investments, resulting in a decline in the Fund's income. Counterparty Risk . A Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties with which the Fund enters into derivatives\ncontracts and other transactions such as repurchase agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. A Fund's\nability to profit from these types of investments and transactions will depend on the willingness and\nability of its counterparty to perform its obligations. If a counterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate or realize any gain on the investment or transaction,\nresulting in a loss to the Fund. A Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in an\ninsolvency, bankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding involving its counterparty (including recovery of\nany collateral posted by it) and may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such\ncircumstances. If a Fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty, it may be delayed or prevented from\nrealizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or contractual provisions, including if a Fund enters into an investment\nor transaction with a financial institution and such financial institution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial difficulties, then the Fund may in certain situations be prevented or\ndelayed from exercising its rights to terminate the investment or transaction, or to realize on any\ncollateral and may result in the suspension of payment and delivery obligations of the parties under such\ninvestment or transactions or in another institution being substituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, a Fund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under applicable law\nwhereby, if required by the financial institution's authority, the financial institution's liabilities could\nbe written down, eliminated or converted into equity or an alternative instrument of ownership. A bail-in of\na financial institution may result in a reduction in value of some or all of its securities and, if a Fund\nholds such securities or has entered into a transaction with such a financial security when a bail-in\noccurs, such Fund may also be similarly impacted. Credit Risk . Credit risk is the risk that an issuer,\nguarantor or liquidity provider of a fixed-income security held by a Fund may be unable or unwilling, or may\nbe perceived (whether by market participants, ratings agencies, pricing services or otherwise) as unable or\nunwilling, to make timely principal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. It\nincludes the risk that the security will be downgraded by a credit rating agency; generally, lower credit\nquality issuers present higher credit risks. An actual or perceived decline in creditworthiness of an issuer\nof a fixed-income security held by a Fund may result in a decrease in the value of the security. It is\npossible that the ability of an issuer to meet its obligations will decline substantially during the period\nwhen a Fund owns securities of the issuer or that the issuer will default on its obligations or that the\nobligations of the issuer will be limited or restructured. 39 The credit rating assigned to any particular\ninvestment does not necessarily reflect the issuer's current financial condition and does not reflect an\nassessment of an investment's volatility or liquidity. Securities rated in the lowest category of\ninvestment-grade are considered to have speculative characteristics. If a security held by a Fund loses its\nrating or its rating is downgraded, the Fund may nonetheless continue to hold the security in the discretion\nof the Adviser. In the case of asset-backed or mortgage-related securities, changes in the actual or\nperceived ability of the obligors on the underlying assets or mortgages to make payments of interest and/or\nprincipal may affect the values of those securities. Currency Risk. Investments in issuers in different\ncountries are often denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the values of those\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar may have a positive or negative effect on the values of a Fund's\ninvestments denominated in those currencies. The values of other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may\nfluctuate in response to, among other factors, interest rate changes, intervention (or failure to intervene)\nby national governments, central banks, or supranational entities such as the International Monetary Fund,\nthe imposition of currency controls, and other political or regulatory developments. Currency values can\ndecrease significantly both in the short term and over the long term in response to these and other\ndevelopments. Continuing uncertainty as to the status of the Euro and the Economic and Monetary Union of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201cEMU\u201d) has created significant volatility in currency and financial markets generally.\nAny partial or complete dissolution of the EMU, or any continued uncertainty as to its status, could have\nsignificant adverse effects on currency and financial markets, and on the values of a Fund's portfolio\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk . The values of debt securities may increase or decrease as a result of\nthe following: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments\nor illiquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate environment may cause the value of a Fund's fixed income\nsecurities to decrease, a decline in a Fund's income and yield, an adverse impact on the liquidity of a\nFund's fixed income securities, and increased volatility of the fixed income markets. During periods when\ninterest rates are at low levels, a Fund's yield can be low, and a Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it\nmay lose money on an operating basis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of principal may have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest rates, the income received by a Fund may\ndecline. Changes in interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the values of debt securities of\nlonger durations. Returns on investments in debt securities could trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity securities. High levels of inflation and/or a significantly\nchanging interest rate environment can lead to heightened levels of volatility and reduced liquidity.\nDerivatives Risk. A derivative is a financial contract the value of which depends on, or is derived from,\nthe value of an underlying asset, interest rate, or index. Derivative transactions typically involve\nleverage and may have significant volatility. It is possible that a derivative transaction will result in a\nloss greater than the principal amount invested, and a Fund may not be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price. Risks associated with derivative instruments include potential\nchanges in value in response to interest rate changes or other market developments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential for the derivative transaction not to have the effect the\nAdviser anticipated or a different or less favorable effect than the Adviser anticipated; the failure of the\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction to perform its obligations under the transaction or to settle a\ntrade; possible mispricing or improper valuation of the derivative instrument; imperfect correlation in the\nvalue of a derivative with the asset, rate, or index underlying the derivative; the risk that a Fund may be\nrequired to post collateral or margin with its counterparty, and will not be able to recover the collateral\nor margin in the event of the counterparty's insolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will experience\nlosses on its derivatives investments and on its other portfolio investments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or entirely to hedge those portfolio investments; the risks specific to\nthe asset underlying the derivative instrument; lack of liquidity for the derivative instrument, including,\nwithout limitation, absence of a secondary trading market; the potential for reduced returns to a Fund due\nto losses on the transaction and an increase in volatility; the potential for the derivative transaction to\nhave the effect of accelerating the recognition of gain; and legal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. 40 Forward Currency Contracts Risk . In a forward currency contract,\na Fund agrees to buy in the future an amount in one currency in return for another currency, at an exchange\nrate determined at the time the contract is entered into. If currency exchange rates have moved against the\nFund's position at the time the contract is settled or closed, the Fund will lose money on the contract.\nThere is no limit on the extent to which exchange rates may move against a Fund's position. The markets for\ncertain currencies may at times become illiquid, and a Fund may be unable to enter into new forward\ncontracts or to close out existing contracts. Forward currency contracts are entered into in the over-the-\ncounter market, and a Fund's ability to profit from a contract will depend on the willingness and ability of\nits counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract. Use by a Fund of foreign currency forward\ncontracts may give rise to investment leverage. Futures Contract Risk . The risk of loss relating to the use\nof futures contracts is potentially unlimited. The ability to establish and close out positions in futures\ncontracts will be subject to the development and maintenance of a liquid market. There is no assurance that\na liquid market on an exchange will exist for any particular futures contract or at any particular time. In\nthe event no such market exists, it might not be possible to effect closing transactions, and a Fund will be\nunable to terminate the futures contract. In using futures contracts, a Fund will be reliant on the ability\nof the Adviser to predict market and price movements correctly; the skills needed to use such futures\ncontracts successfully are different from those needed for traditional portfolio management. If a Fund uses\nfutures contracts for hedging purposes, there is a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the futures contracts and movements in the securities or index underlying the futures contracts or\nmovements in the prices of the Fund's investments that are the subject of such hedge. The prices of futures\ncontracts, for a number of reasons, may not correlate perfectly with movements in the securities or index\nunderlying them. For example, participants in the futures markets are subject to margin deposit\nrequirements. Such requirements may cause investors to take actions with respect to their futures positions\nthat they would not otherwise take. The margin requirements in the futures markets may be less onerous than\nmargin requirements in the securities markets in general, and as a result those markets may attract more\nspeculators than the securities markets do. Increased participation by speculators in those markets may\ncause temporary price distortions. Due to the possibility of price distortion, even a correct forecast of\ngeneral market trends by the Adviser still may not result in a successful futures activity over a very short\ntime period. The risk of a position in a futures contract may be very large compared to the relatively low\nlevel of margin a Fund is required to deposit. A Fund will typically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with its transactions in futures contracts. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain\nto the investor relative to the size of a required margin deposit. A Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its futures transactions. In the event of an insolvency of the futures commission merchant\nor a clearing house, a Fund may not be able to recover all (or any) of the margin it has posted with the\nfutures commission merchant, or to realize the value of any increase in the price of its positions, or it\nmay experience a significant delay in doing so. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d),\ncertain foreign regulators, and many futures exchanges have established limits referred to as \u201cposition\nlimits\u201d on the maximum net long or net short positions that any person and certain affiliated entities may\nhold or control in a particular futures and options contract. In addition, federal position limits apply to\nswaps that are economically equivalent to futures contracts on certain agricultural, metals and energy\ncommodities. All positions owned or controlled by the same person or entity, even if in different accounts,\nmust be aggregated for purposes of complying with position limits. It is possible that the positions of\ndifferent clients managed by the Adviser may be aggregated for this purpose. Therefore, the trading\ndecisions of the Adviser may have to be modified and positions held by a Fund liquidated in order to avoid\nexceeding such limits. The modification of investment decisions or the elimination of open positions, if it\noccurs, may adversely affect the performance of a Fund. A violation of position limits could also lead to\nregulatory action materially adverse to a Fund's investment strategy. The Fund may also be affected by other\nregimes, including those of the European Union and United Kingdom, and trading venues that impose position\nlimits on commodity derivative contracts. In addition, exchanges may establish accountability levels\napplicable to a futures contract instead of position limits, provided that the futures contract is not\nsubject to federal position limits. An exchange may order a person who holds or controls a position in\nexcess of a position accountability level not to further increase its position, to comply with any\nprospective limit that exceeds the size of the position owned or controlled, or to reduce any open position\nthat exceeds the position accountability level if the exchange determines that such action is necessary to\nmaintain an orderly market. Position accountability levels could adversely affect a Fund's 41 ability to\nestablish and maintain positions in commodity futures contracts to which such levels apply, if the Fund were\nto trade in such contracts, and a Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective. Futures contracts\ntraded on markets outside the U.S. are not generally subject to the same level of regulation by the CFTC or\nother U.S. regulatory entities as contracts traded in the U.S., including without limitation as to the\nexecution, delivery, and clearing of transactions. U.S. regulators neither regulate the activities of a\nforeign exchange, nor have the power to compel enforcement of the rules of the foreign exchange or the laws\nof the foreign country in question. Margin and other payments made by a Fund may not be afforded the same\nprotections as are afforded those payments in the U.S., including in connection with the insolvency of an\nexecuting or clearing broker or a clearinghouse or exchange. Certain foreign futures contracts may be less\nliquid and more volatile than U.S. contracts. Swaps Risk. A swap is a two-party contract that generally\nobligates the parties to exchange payments based on a specified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve greater risks than direct investment in securities\nbecause swaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk ( e.g. , the risk of a counterparty's\ndefaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk ( i.e. , swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). Swaps may also be considered illiquid. It may not be possible for a Fund to liquidate a swap\nposition at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses. Emerging Markets Risk .\nInvestments in emerging markets are generally subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in\ndeveloped markets. This may be due to, among other things, the possibility of greater market volatility,\nlower trading volume and liquidity, greater risk of expropriation, nationalization, and social, political\nand economic instability, greater reliance on a few industries, international trade or revenue from\nparticular commodities, less developed accounting, legal and regulatory systems, increased potential for\nmarket manipulation, higher levels of inflation, deflation or currency devaluation, greater risk of market\nshutdown, and more significant governmental limitations on investment policy as compared to those typically\nfound in a developed market. There may be limited legal rights and remedies for investors in companies\ndomiciled in emerging markets. In addition, issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may\nhave less financial stability than in other countries. The securities of emerging market companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial\nmarket corrections may limit very significantly the liquidity of securities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of all companies in the country or region. A Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its positions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the\nFund's obligations. There is also the potential for unfavorable action such as embargoes and acts of war. As\na result, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility in investments in emerging market\ncountries, which may be magnified by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Settlement and asset\ncustody practices for transactions in emerging markets may differ from those in developed markets. Such\ndifferences may include possible delays in settlement and certain settlement practices, such as delivery of\nsecurities prior to receipt of payment, which increase the likelihood of a \u201cfailed settlement.\u201d Failed\nsettlements can result in losses. For these and other reasons, investments in emerging markets are often\nconsidered speculative. Extension Risk. During periods of rising interest rates, the average life of certain\ntypes of securities may be extended because of slower-than-expected principal payments. This may increase\nthe period of time during which an investment earns a below-market interest rate, increase the security's\nduration and reduce the value of the security. Extension risk may be heightened during periods of adverse\neconomic conditions generally, as payment rates decline due to higher unemployment levels and other factors.\nFinancial Sector Risk. Financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which\nmay limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, the interest\nrates and fees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause an unusually\nhigh degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain financial\nservices companies to incur large losses. Securities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the valuations of their\nassets, 42 take action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or cease\noperations. Credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can negatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be subject to severe\nprice competition. Adverse economic, business or political developments could adversely affect financial\ninstitutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk .\nThe net asset value of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of a Fund's\nsecurities holdings. The market prices of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in\na Fund's net asset value and supply and demand of Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be predicted\nwhether Fund Shares will trade below, at or above their net asset value. Price differences may be due, in\nlarge part, to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the\nsecurities of an Index trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in time. The market prices of\nFund Shares may deviate significantly from the net asset value of Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units (unlike shares of\nmany closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to,\ntheir net asset value), the Adviser believes that large discounts or premiums to the net asset value of Fund\nShares should not be sustained over long periods. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make\nit likely that Fund Shares normally will trade close to a Fund's net asset value, disruptions to creations\nand redemptions or market volatility may result in trading prices that differ significantly from such Fund's\nnet asset value. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time when the market price is at a premium to the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a time when the market price is at a discount to the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares, then the investor may sustain losses. Geographic Focus Risk . The performance of a\nfund that invests significantly in one or more countries or geographic regions will be closely tied to\nmarket, currency, economic, political, environmental, or regulatory conditions and developments in the\ncountries or regions in which the fund invests, and may be more volatile than the performance of a fund that\ndoes not invest significantly in such countries or regions. Asia . Certain Asian economies have experienced\nhigh inflation, high unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit.\nMany Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization, and there is no assurance that\nthis growth rate will be maintained. Economic events in any one Asian country may have a significant\neconomic effect on the entire Asian region, as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse\nevent in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the\ncountries in which a Fund invests. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, including corruption\nand regional conflict with neighboring countries. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social\nand labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks,\namong others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund's investments. Europe . The Economic and Monetary\nUnion of the EU requires compliance with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt\nlevels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe.\nDecreasing imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default or threat of default by an EU\nmember country on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member country may have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the economies of EU member countries and their trading partners. The European\nfinancial markets have recently experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic\ndownturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy,\nPortugal and Spain. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro. Responses to the\nfinancial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments\nand other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and\nasset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw\nfrom the EU. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) formally withdrew from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d)\n(commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d). An agreement between the UK and the EU governing their future trade\nrelationship 43 became effective January 1, 2021, but that agreement does not include an agreement on\nfinancial services, and it is unlikely that such agreement will be concluded. Moreover, the UK government\nhas started a program of financial services law reform with the ultimate aim of repealing many EU financial\nservices laws that were assimilated into UK law from January 1, 2021, and replacing them with legislation or\nrules made by the UK government or financial services regulators. Accordingly, uncertainty remains in\ncertain areas as to the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Brexit has already had a significant\nimpact on the UK, Europe, and global economies, and could continue to result in volatility and illiquidity,\nlegal, political, economic and regulatory uncertainties and lower economic growth for these economies that\ncould in turn have an adverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. Any further exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, or the abandonment of the euro, may cause additional market disruption\nglobally and introduce new legal and regulatory uncertainties. In addition, a number of countries in Europe\nhave suffered terrorist attacks and additional attacks may occur in the future. Such attacks may cause\nuncertainty in financial markets and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund\nhas exposure. Japan. The growth of Japan's economy has historically lagged that of its Asian neighbors and\nother major developed economies. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has\nbeen adversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies\nand the economic conditions of its trading partners. China has become an important trading partner with\nJapan, yet the countries' political relationship has become strained. Should political tension increase, it\ncould adversely affect the economy, especially the export sector, and destabilize the region as a whole.\nJapan also remains heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a\nnegative impact on the economy. The Japanese economy faces several other concerns, including a financial\nsystem with large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-\nownership by major corporations, a changing corporate governance structure, and large government deficits.\nThese issues may cause a slowdown of the Japanese economy. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times\nand any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan\nhas, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce the value of the yen.\nJapanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and\nunpredictably and could cause losses to investors. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a\nsignificant population decline in recent years. Japan's labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental\nstructural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to meet the\nneed for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan's economic competitiveness. Natural\ndisasters, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas\nand could negatively affect the Japanese economy and, in turn, a Fund. United Kingdom. The UK has one of the\nlargest economies in Europe, and the United States and other European countries are substantial trading\npartners of the UK. As a result, the British economy may be impacted by changes to the economic condition of\nthe United States and other European countries. The British economy relies heavily on the export of\nfinancial services to the United States and other European countries and, therefore, a prolonged slowdown in\nthe financial services sector may have a negative impact on the British economy. Continued governmental\ninvolvement or control in certain sectors may stifle competition in certain sectors or cause adverse effects\non economic growth. In the past, the UK has been a target of terrorism. Acts of terrorism in the UK or\nagainst British interests abroad may cause uncertainty in the British financial markets and adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. On January 31, 2020, the UK formally withdrew\nfrom the EU (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d). An agreement between the UK and the EU governing their future\ntrade relationship became effective January 1, 2021, but that agreement does not include an agreement on\nfinancial services, and it is unlikely that such agreement will be concluded. Moreover, the UK government\nhas started a program of financial services law reform with the ultimate aim of repealing many EU financial\nservices laws that were assimilated into UK law from January 1, 2021, and replacing them with legislation or\nrules made by the UK government or financial services regulators. Accordingly, uncertainty remains in\ncertain areas as to the future relationship between the UK and the EU. Brexit has already had a significant\nimpact on the UK, Europe, and global economies, and could continue to result in volatility and illiquidity,\nlegal, political, economic and regulatory uncertainties and lower economic growth for these economies 44\nthat could in turn have an adverse effect on the value of the Funds' investments. Any further exits from the\nEU, or the possibility of such exits, or the abandonment of the euro, may cause additional market disruption\nglobally and introduce new legal and regulatory uncertainties. Income Risk. A Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by a Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by a Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying income at lower rates. A reduction in the income earned\nby a Fund may limit the Fund's ability to achieve its objective. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk .\nEach Fund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities. Each Fund will seek to provide investment results that correspond generally\nto the performance of the Index, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. Each Fund generally will buy and will not sell a security included in the\nIndex as long as the security is part of the Index regardless of any sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the security, even though the Adviser may make a different\ninvestment decision for other actively managed accounts or portfolios that hold the security. As a result, a\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Index (in absolute terms and by comparison with other indices) and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on a Fund and its\nshareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, an Index may include, and the\ncorresponding Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not align with\nthe Index's objective and/or criteria. While the Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index (i.e.,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), a Fund's return may not match the return of the Index\nfor a number of reasons. For example, the return on the sample of securities purchased by a Fund (or the\nreturn on securities not included in the Index) may not correlate precisely with the return of the Index.\nEach Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in buying and\nselling securities. In addition, a Fund may not be fully invested at times, either as a result of cash flows\ninto or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between a Fund's return and that of\nthe Index. Changes in the composition of the Index and regulatory requirements also may impact a Fund's\nability to match the return of the Index. The Adviser may apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment\ntechniques to refine or limit the number or types of issuers included in the Index in which a Fund may\ninvest. Application of such screens or techniques may result in investment performance below that of the\nIndex and may not produce results expected by the Adviser. Index tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Pursuant to each Index methodology,\na security may be removed from an Index in the event that it does not comply with the eligibility\nrequirements of the Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced to sell securities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the Index components. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of an Index and the corresponding Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio\nto attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund's portfolio and the Index, any transaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnscheduled changes to an Index may expose the corresponding Fund to additional tracking error risk. A Fund\nmay recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect changes\nin the securities included in the corresponding Index. A Fund also may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax consequences. Industrial Sector Risk .\nIndustrial companies are affected by supply and demand both for their specific product or service and for\nindustrial sector products and services in general. Government regulation, world events, exchange rates and\neconomic conditions, technological developments and liabilities for environmental damage and general civil\nliabilities will likewise affect the performance of these companies. Aerospace and defense companies, a\ncomponent of the industrial sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because\ncompanies involved in this 45 industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and foreign government demand\nfor their products and services. Thus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by governmental defense spending policies which are typically under\npressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other) government budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have occasional sharp price movements which may result\nfrom changes in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and insurance costs. Inflation-Indexed Securities\nRisk . The principal amount of an inflation-indexed security typically increases with inflation and\ndecreases with deflation, as measured by a specified index. It is possible that, in a period of declining\ninflation rates, a Fund could receive at maturity less than the initial principal amount of an inflation-\nindexed security. Although the holders of TIPS receive no less than the par value of the security at\nmaturity, if a Fund purchases TIPS in the secondary market whose principal values have previously been\nadjusted upward and there is a period of subsequent declining inflation rates, a Fund may receive at\nmaturity less than it invested. Depending on the changes in inflation rates during the period a Fund holds\nan inflation-indexed security, a Fund may earn less on the security than on a conventional bond. The\nprincipal amounts of inflation-indexed securities are typically only adjusted periodically, and changes in\nthe values of the securities may only approximately reflect changes in inflation rates and may occur\nsubstantially after the changes in inflation rates in question occur. Interest Rate Risk . Interest rate\nrisk is the risk that the securities held by a Fund will decline in value because of increases in market\ninterest rates. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in\ninterest rates. Debt securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest\nrates, usually making them more volatile than debt securities with shorter durations. For example, the value\nof a security with a duration of five years would be expected to decrease by 5% for every 1% increase in\ninterest rates. Falling interest rates also create the potential for a decline in a Fund's income and yield.\nInterest-only and principal-only securities are especially sensitive to interest rate changes, which can\naffect not only their prices but can also change the income flows and repayment assumptions about those\ninvestments. Variable and floating rate securities also generally increase or decrease in value in response\nto changes in interest rates, although generally to a lesser degree than fixed-rate securities. A\nsubstantial increase in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on the liquidity of a security,\nespecially those with longer durations. Interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable, and are\ninfluenced by a number of factors, including government policy, monetary policy, inflation expectations,\nperceptions of risk, and supply and demand for bonds. Changes in government or central bank policy,\nincluding changes in tax policy or changes in a central bank's implementation of specific policy goals, may\nhave a substantial impact on interest rates. This could lead to heightened levels of interest rate,\nvolatility and liquidity risks for the fixed income markets generally and could have a substantial and\nimmediate effect on the values of a Fund's investments. There can be no guarantee that any particular\ngovernment or central bank policy will be continued, discontinued or changed, nor that any such policy will\nhave the desired effect on interest rates. Leveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions, reverse repurchase\nagreements, certain derivatives transactions, securities lending transactions and other investment\ntransactions such as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward commitment transactions may create investment\nleverage. If a Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund's investment\nportfolio, the value of the Fund will be potentially more volatile and all other risks will tend to be\ncompounded. This is because leverage generally creates investment risk with respect to a larger base of\nassets than a Fund would otherwise have and so magnifies the effect of any increase or decrease in the value\nof the Fund's underlying assets. The use of leverage is considered to be a speculative investment practice\nand may result in losses to a Fund. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of\nthe size of the initial investment. The use of leverage may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may\nnot be advantageous to do so to satisfy repayment, interest payment, or margin obligations or to meet asset\ncoverage requirements. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk that a Fund may not be able to dispose of\ninvestments readily at a favorable time or prices (or at all) or at prices approximating those at which a\nFund currently values them. For example, certain investments may be subject to restrictions on resale, may\ntrade in the over-the-counter market or in limited volume, or may not have an active trading market.\nIlliquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be subject to\nwide fluctuations in market value. It may be difficult for a Fund to value illiquid investments accurately.\nThe market for certain investments may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions\nindependent of any specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer. If the liquidity of a\nFund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net\nasset 46 value of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Disposal of illiquid\ninvestments may entail registration expenses and other transaction costs that are higher than those for\nliquid investments. A Fund may seek to borrow money to meet its obligations (including among other things\nredemption obligations) if it is unable to dispose of illiquid investments, resulting in borrowing expenses\nand possible leveraging of the Fund. Market Risk . Market prices of investments held by a Fund will go up or\ndown, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. A Fund's investments are subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile, and prices of investments can change substantially due to various\nfactors, including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers and general market liquidity. Even if general\neconomic conditions do not change, the value of an investment in a Fund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the Fund invests do not perform well or are adversely affected by\nevents. Further, legal, political, regulatory and tax changes also may cause fluctuations in markets and\nsecurities prices. Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism,\ntrade policy changes or disputes, the threat of or actual imposition of tariffs, natural disasters, public\nhealth issues, or other events could have a significant impact on a Fund and its investments. Due to the\ninterconnectedness of economies and financial markets throughout the world, whether or not a Fund invests in\nsecurities of issuers located in or with significant exposure to countries experiencing economic and\nfinancial difficulties, the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments may be negatively affected. A\nwidespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as COVID-19, and efforts to contain its spread, may\nresult in market volatility, inflation, reduced liquidity of certain instruments, disruption in the trading\nof certain instruments, and systemic economic weakness. The foregoing could impact a Fund and its\ninvestments and result in disruptions to the services provided to a Fund by its service providers. Non-\nDiversification Risk . Funds classified as \u201cnon-diversified\u201d may hold a smaller number of portfolio\nsecurities than many other funds. To the extent a Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. A Fund may become diversified for periods of time solely as a result of\ntracking its Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component securities). Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk . Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers entail risks not typically associated with investing in\nsecurities of U.S. issuers. Similar risks may apply to securities traded on a U.S. securities exchange that\nare issued by entities with significant exposure to non-U.S. countries. In certain countries, legal remedies\navailable to investors may be more limited than those available with regard to U.S. investments. Because\nnon-U.S. securities are typically denominated and traded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the value\nof the Fund's assets, to the extent they are non-U.S. dollar denominated, may be affected favorably or\nunfavorably by currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations, and delays, restrictions or\nprohibitions on the repatriation of non-U.S. currencies. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the exchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open,\nthere may be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for\nthe underlying security on the closed foreign market. These deviations could result in the Fund experiencing\npremiums or discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in domestic securities. Income and gains with\nrespect to investments in certain countries may be subject to withholding and other taxes. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities\nare not subject to accounting, auditing, and financial reporting standards, regulatory framework and\npractices comparable to those in the United States. The securities of some non-U.S. entities are less liquid\nand at times more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. entities, and could become subject to\nsanctions or embargoes that adversely affect a Fund's investment. Non-U.S. transaction costs, such as\nbrokerage commissions and custody costs may be higher than in the U.S. In addition, there may be a\npossibility of nationalization or expropriation of assets, imposition of currency exchange controls,\nconfiscatory taxation, and diplomatic developments that could adversely affect the values of a Fund's\ninvestments in issuers in certain non-U.S. countries. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers also are\nsubject to foreign political and economic risk not associated with U.S. investments, meaning that political\nevents (civil unrest, national elections, changes in political conditions and foreign relations, imposition\nof exchange controls and repatriation restrictions), social and economic events (labor strikes, rising\ninflation) and natural disasters occurring in a country where a Fund invests could cause the Fund's\ninvestments to experience gains or losses. In addition, the threat of or actual imposition of tariffs may\nadversely impact the price of non-U.S. securities. 47 Reinvestment Risk. Income from a Fund's portfolio may\ndecline when the Fund invests the proceeds from investment income, sales of portfolio securities or matured,\ntraded or called debt obligations. For instance, during periods of declining interest rates, an issuer of\ndebt obligations may exercise an option to redeem securities prior to maturity, forcing a Fund to reinvest\nthe proceeds in lower-yielding securities. A decline in income received by a Fund from its investments is\nlikely to have a negative effect on the yield and total return of the Fund Shares. Restricted Securities\nRisk . A Fund may hold securities that have not been registered for sale to the public under the U.S.\nfederal securities laws pursuant to an exemption from registration. These securities may be less liquid than\nsecurities registered for sale to the general public. The liquidity of a restricted security may be affected\nby a number of factors, including, among others: (i) the creditworthiness of the issuer; (ii) the frequency\nof trades and quotes for the security; (iii) the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security\nand the number of other potential purchasers; (iv) dealer undertakings to make a market in the security; (v)\nthe nature of any legal restrictions governing trading in the security; and (vi) the nature of the security\nand the nature of marketplace trades. There can be no assurance that a liquid trading market will exist at\nany time for any particular restricted security. Also, restricted securities may be difficult to value\nbecause market quotations may not be readily available, and the securities may have significant volatility.\nSettlement Risk . Markets in different countries have different clearance and settlement procedures and in\ncertain markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of\ntransactions. Delays in settlement may increase credit risk to a Fund, limit the ability of a Fund to\nreinvest the proceeds of a sale of securities, hinder the ability of a Fund to lend its portfolio\nsecurities, and potentially subject a Fund to penalties for its failure to deliver to on-purchasers of\nsecurities whose delivery to a Fund was delayed. Delays in the settlement of securities purchased by a Fund\nmay limit the ability of a Fund to sell those securities at times and prices it considers desirable, and may\nsubject a Fund to losses and costs due to its own inability to settle with subsequent purchasers of the\nsecurities from it. A Fund may be required to borrow monies it had otherwise expected to receive in\nconnection with the settlement of securities sold by it, in order to meet its obligations to others. Limits\non the ability of a Fund to purchase or sell securities due to settlement delays could increase any variance\nbetween a Fund's performance and that of its benchmark index. Sovereign Debt Obligations Risk . Investments\nin debt securities issued by governments or by government agencies and instrumentalities involve the risk\nthat the governmental entities responsible for repayment may be unable or unwilling to pay interest and\nrepay principal when due. A governmental entity's willingness or ability to pay interest and repay principal\nin a timely manner may be affected by a variety of factors, including its cash flow, the size of its\nreserves, its access to foreign exchange, the relative size of its debt service burden to its economy as a\nwhole, and political constraints. A governmental entity may default on its obligations or may require\nrenegotiation or reschedule of debt payments. Any restructuring of a sovereign debt obligation held by a\nFund will likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of the obligation. In the event of default\nof sovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to pursue legal action against the sovereign issuer or to realize\non collateral securing the debt. The sovereign debt of certain non-U.S. governments, including their sub-\ndivisions and instrumentalities, is rated below investment-grade. Sovereign debt risk may be greater for\ndebt securities issued or guaranteed by emerging and/or frontier countries. Unconstrained Sector Risk . A\nFund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within one or more economic sectors or industries, which\nmay change from time to time. When a Fund focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector,\nfinancial, economic, business, and other developments affecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not focused its assets in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector, which may increase the volatility of the Fund. Valuation Risk .\nCertain portfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be\nused to value a portfolio holding when market quotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ from what would be produced using a different\nmethodology or if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations were used. Technological\nissues or other service disruption issues involving third-party service 48 providers may cause a Fund to\nvalue its investments incorrectly. In addition, there is no assurance that a Fund could sell or close out a\nportfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that a Fund would incur\na loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by a\nFund at that time. Non-Principal Risks Each risk discussed below is a non-principal risk of a Fund to the\nextent it is not identified as a principal risk for such Fund in the preceding \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION\n- PRINCIPAL RISKS\u201d section. Authorized Participants, Market Makers and Liquidity Providers Concentration\nRisk. A Fund has a limited number of financial institutions that may act as Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d),\nwhich are responsible for the creation and redemption activity for a Fund. In addition, there may be a\nlimited number of market makers and/or liquidity providers in the marketplace. To the extent either of the\nfollowing events occur, Fund Shares may trade at a material discount to NAV and possibly face delisting: (i)\nAPs exit the business or otherwise become unable to process creation and/or redemption orders and no other\nAPs step forward to perform these services, or (ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers exit the\nbusiness or significantly reduce their business activities and no other entities step forward to perform\ntheir functions. Cash Transaction Risk . To the extent a Fund sells portfolio securities to meet some or all\nof a redemption request with cash, the Fund may incur taxable gains or losses that it might not have\nincurred had it made redemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, a Fund may pay out higher annual capital\ngain distributions than if the in-kind redemption process was used. Concentration Risk. A Fund's assets may\nbe concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to the extent that the Fund's underlying\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and other developments affecting issuers in\nthat industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not focused\nits assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a Fund will be subject to a number of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser or its affiliates may provide services to a Fund, such as\nsecurities lending agency services, custodial, administrative, bookkeeping, and accounting services,\ntransfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities brokerage services, and other services for which the\nFund would compensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise affiliated with the Adviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its affiliates, or the terms on which it enters into\ntransactions with the Adviser or its affiliates will be the most favorable available in the market generally\nor as favorable as the rates the Adviser or its affiliates make available to other clients. Because of its\nfinancial interest, the Adviser will have an incentive to enter into transactions or arrangements on behalf\nof a Fund with itself or its affiliates in circumstances where it might not have done so in the absence of\nthat interest, provided that the Adviser will comply with applicable regulatory requirements. The Adviser\nand its affiliates serve as investment adviser to other clients and may make investment decisions that may\nbe different from those that will be made by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds. For example, the Adviser\nmay provide asset allocation advice to some clients that may include a recommendation to invest in or redeem\nfrom particular issuers while not providing that same recommendation to all clients invested in the same or\nsimilar issuers. The Adviser may (subject to applicable law) be simultaneously seeking to purchase (or sell)\ninvestments for a Fund and to sell (or purchase) the same investment for accounts, funds, or structured\nproducts for which it serves as asset manager, or for other clients or affiliates. The Adviser and its\naffiliates may invest for clients in various securities that are senior, pari passu or junior to, or have\ninterests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by a Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other business activities, may acquire material nonpublic confidential\ninformation that may restrict the Adviser from purchasing securities or selling securities for itself or its\nclients (including the Funds) or otherwise using such information for the benefit of its clients or itself.\nThe foregoing does not purport to be a comprehensive list or complete explanation of all potential conflicts\nof interests which may affect a Fund. A Fund may encounter circumstances, or enter into transactions, in\nwhich conflicts of interest that are not listed or discussed above may arise. 49 Costs of Buying and Selling\nShares . Investors buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or\nother charges imposed by brokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed\namount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small\namounts of Fund Shares. In addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the difference\nbetween the price that an investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at\nwhich an investor is willing to sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask prices is\noften referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time for Fund Shares\nbased on trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if Fund Shares have more trading volume\nand market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares have little trading volume and market liquidity. Further,\nincreased market volatility may cause increased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling Fund\nShares, including bid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Fund Shares may significantly reduce investment\nresults and an investment in Fund Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Cybersecurity Risk . With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the\ndependence on computer systems to perform business and operational functions, funds (such as the Funds) and\ntheir service providers (including the Adviser) may be prone to operational and information security risks\nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or technological malfunctions. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions may have\nincreased the scale and sophistication of deliberate cybersecurity attacks, particularly those from nation-\nstates or from entities with nation-state backing. In general, cyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects. Cyber-attacks include, among others, stealing or corrupting\ndata maintained online or digitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information without authorization, and causing operational disruption.\nSuccessful cyber-attacks against, or security breakdowns of, a Fund, the Adviser, or a custodian, transfer\nagent, or other affiliated or third-party service provider may adversely affect a Fund or its shareholders.\nFor instance, cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may interfere with the processing of shareholder or\nother transactions, affect a Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the release of private shareholder\ninformation or confidential Fund information, impede trading, cause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial losses, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and\nadditional compliance costs. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may render records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and other data integral to the functioning of a Fund\ninaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. A Fund may also incur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund and its shareholders could be\nnegatively impacted as a result. While the Adviser has established business continuity plans and systems\ndesigned to minimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the use of technology, processes and controls, there\nare inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not\nbeen identified, given the evolving nature of this threat. The use of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) and\nmachine learning could exacerbate these risks or result in cyber security incidents that implicate personal\ndata. Each Fund relies on third-party service providers for many of its day-to-day operations, and will be\nsubject to the risk that the protections and protocols implemented by those service providers will be\nineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-attack. The Adviser does not control the cybersecurity plans and\nsystems put in place by third-party service providers, and such third-party service providers may have\nlimited indemnification obligations to the Adviser or the Funds. Similar types of cybersecurity risks or\ntechnical malfunctions also are present for issuers of securities in which each Fund invests, which could\nresult in material adverse consequences for such issuers, and may cause a Fund's investment in such\nsecurities to lose value. Index Construction Risk . A security included in an Index may not exhibit the\ncharacteristic or provide the specific exposure for which it was selected and consequently a Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that characteristic or exposure. Index Licensing Risk . It is\npossible that the license under which the Adviser or a Fund is permitted to replicate or otherwise use an\nIndex will be terminated or may be disputed, impaired or cease to remain in effect. In such a case, the\nAdviser may be required to replace the relevant Index with another index which it considers to be\nappropriate in light of the investment strategy of a Fund. The use of any such substitute index may have an\nadverse impact on a Fund's performance. In the event that the Adviser is unable to identify a suitable\nreplacement for the relevant Index, it may determine to terminate a Fund. Money Market Fund Investment Risk\n. An investment in a money market fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFDIC or any other government agency. Certain money market funds seek to preserve the value of their shares\nat $1.00 per share, although there can be no assurance that they will do so, and it is possible to 50 lose\nmoney by investing in such a money market fund. A major or unexpected change in interest rates or a decline\nin the credit quality of an issuer or entity providing credit support, an inactive trading market for money\nmarket instruments, or adverse market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause the share price of such a money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is possible that\nsuch a money market fund will issue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at times when the fair value of the\nmoney market fund's portfolio per share is more or less than $1.00. None of State Street Corporation, State\nStreet, State Street Global Advisors (\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (the \u201cState Street Entities\u201d)\nguarantee the value of an investment in a money market fund at $1.00 per share. Investors should have no\nexpectation of capital support to a money market fund from State Street Entities. Other money market funds\nprice and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV that will fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of\nfund assets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or less than their original purchase\nprice. Recent changes in the regulation of money market funds may affect the operations and structures of\nmoney market funds. A money market fund may be permitted or required to impose redemption fees during times\nof market stress. Portfolio Turnover Risk . A Fund may engage in frequent trading of its portfolio\nsecurities. Fund turnover generally involves a number of direct and indirect costs and expenses to a Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and transaction costs\non the sale of securities and reinvestment in other securities. The costs related to increased portfolio\nturnover have the effect of reducing a Fund's investment return, and the sale of securities by the Fund may\nresult in the realization of taxable capital gains, including short-term capital gains. A Fund may engage in\nsignificant trading of its portfolio securities in connection with Index rebalancing. Frequent or\nsignificant trading may cause a Fund to incur additional transaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does not engage in frequent or significant trading. Regulatory\nRisk. Governmental and regulatory actions may have unexpected or adverse consequences on particular markets,\nstrategies, or investments, which may adversely impact a Fund and impair how it is managed. Policy and\nlegislative changes in the United States and in other countries may affect aspects of financial regulation,\nand may in some instances contribute to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the financial\nmarkets. The impact of these changes on the markets, and the practical implications for market participants,\nmay not be fully known for some time. Securities Lending Risk. Each Fund may lend portfolio securities in an\namount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For these purposes, net assets shall exclude the\nvalue of all assets received as collateral for the loan. Such loans may be terminated at any time. Any such\nloans must be continuously secured by collateral maintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal\nto the market value of the securities loaned by a Fund, marked to market each trading day. A Fund will\nreceive the amount of all dividends, interest and other distributions on the loaned securities; however, the\nborrower has the right to vote the loaned securities. A Fund will call loans to vote proxies if a material\nissue affecting the investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to recall such securities promptly may be\nunsuccessful, especially for foreign securities or thinly traded securities. Securities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. Should the borrower of the securities fail financially, a Fund may\nexperience delays in recovering the securities or exercising its rights in the collateral. Loans are made\nonly to borrowers that are deemed by the securities lending agent to be of good financial standing. In a\nloan transaction, a Fund will also bear the risk of any decline in value of securities provided as\ncollateral or acquired with cash collateral. Each Fund will attempt to minimize this risk by limiting the\ninvestment of cash collateral to high quality instruments of short maturity either directly on behalf of the\nlending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or funds, which may include those managed by the Adviser.\nTo the extent the collateral provided or investments made with cash collateral differ from securities\nincluded in an Index, such collateral or investments may have a greater risk of loss than the securities\nincluded in the Index. In addition, a Fund will be subject to the risk that any income generated by lending\nits securities or reinvesting cash collateral is lower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower.\nThe Adviser will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when\noverseeing a Fund's securities lending activity. Trading Issues . Although Fund Shares are listed for\ntrading on the Exchange and may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the\nExchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such Fund Shares will develop or be\nmaintained. Trading in Fund Shares on the Exchange may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons\nthat, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in Fund Shares inadvisable. In addition, trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to\nExchange \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of operating companies listed on a stock exchange,\nFund 51\n\nShares may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility in the trading price\nof a Fund's shares. While each Fund expects that the ability of Authorized Participants to create and redeem\nFund Shares at net asset value should be effective in reducing any such volatility, there is no guarantee\nthat it will eliminate the volatility associated with such short sales. There can be no assurance that the\nrequirements of the Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of a Fund will continue to be met or will\nremain unchanged or that Fund Shares will trade with any volume, or at all, on any stock exchange.\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an\ninvestment advisory agreement (\u201cInvestment Advisory Agreement\u201d) between SPDR Series Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) and\nthe Adviser, and, subject to the oversight of the Board, is responsible for the investment management of\neach Fund. The Adviser provides an investment management program for each Fund and manages the investment of\neach Fund's assets. In addition, the Adviser provides administrative, compliance and general management\nservices to each Fund. The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc., which\nitself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Corporation. The Adviser is registered with the SEC\nunder the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Adviser and certain other affiliates of State\nStreet Corporation make up SSGA. SSGA is one of the world's largest institutional money managers and the\ninvestment management arm of State Street Corporation. As of December 31, 2024, the Adviser managed\napproximately $1.11 trillion in assets and SSGA managed approximately $4.72 trillion in assets. The\nAdviser's principal business address is One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. For the services\nprovided to each Fund under the Investment Advisory Agreement, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024,\neach Fund paid the Adviser the annual fees based on a percentage of each Fund's average daily net assets as\nset forth below:\n                                                           \n  SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF    0.30%  \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF   0.50%  \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF    0.35%  \n  SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury  0.35%  \n  Bond ETF                                                 \n  SPDR FTSE International Government                0.50%  \n  Inflation-Protected Bond ETF                             \n                                                           \nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all or a portion of its management fee. The Adviser has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount equal\nto any acquired fund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) for each Fund until April 30, 2026.

SSGA LTD is\nan indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc. (\u201cSSGA, Inc.\u201d) and SSGA Singapore\nis a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of SSGA, Inc.

Pursuant to the personnel-sharing arrangements, certain employees of SSGA LTD and SSGA\nSingapore, as \u201cparticipating affiliates,\u201d serve as \u201cassociated persons\u201d of the Adviser, and, in this\ncapacity, are subject to the oversight of the Adviser and its Chief Compliance Officer. These associated\npersons may, on behalf of the Adviser, provide discretionary investment management services (including\nportfolio management and trading services), research and related services to the applicable Fund(s) in\naccordance with the investment objectives, policies and limitations set forth in the prospectus and SAI.\nSSGA LTD provides such services to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF and the SPDR Bloomberg\nInternational Corporate Bond ETF. SSGA Singapore provides such services to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging\nMarkets Local Bond ETF. Unlike the Adviser, neither SSGA LTD nor SSGA Singapore is registered as an\ninvestment adviser with the SEC. Each personnel-sharing arrangement is based on no-action letters of the\nstaff of the SEC that permit SEC-registered investment advisers to rely on and use the resources of advisory\naffiliates, subject to certain conditions. Prior to March 31, 2023, SSGA LTD was a registered investment\nadviser with the SEC, and provided\n\n52\n\ninvestment sub-advisory services to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF and SPDR Bloomberg\nInternational Corporate Bond ETF.

A\ndiscussion regarding the Board's consideration of the Investment Advisory Agreement is provided in the\nFunds' Form N-CSR filing with the SEC for the period ended June 30, 2024. SSGA FM, as the investment adviser\nfor the Funds, may hire one or more sub-advisers to oversee the day-to-day investment activities of the\nFunds. The sub-advisers are subject to oversight by the Adviser. The Adviser and the Trust have received an\nexemptive order from the SEC that permits the Adviser, with the approval of the Board, including a majority\nof the Independent Trustees, of the Trust, to retain and amend existing sub-advisory agreements with\nunaffiliated investment sub-advisers for a Fund without submitting the sub-advisory agreement to a vote of\nthe Fund's shareholders. The Trust will notify shareholders in the event of any change in the identity of\nsuch sub-adviser or sub-advisers. The Adviser has ultimate responsibility for the investment performance of\nthe Funds due to its responsibility to oversee each sub-adviser and recommend their hiring, termination and\nreplacement. The Adviser is not required to disclose fees paid to any unaffiliated sub-adviser retained\npursuant to the order. Approval by a Fund's shareholders is required before any authority granted under the\nexemptive order may be exercised. Portfolio Managers.\nThe Adviser manages the Funds using a team of investment professionals. The team approach is used to create\nan environment that encourages the flow of investment ideas. The portfolio managers within each team work\ntogether in a cohesive manner to develop and enhance techniques that drive the investment process for the\nrespective investment strategy. This approach requires portfolio managers to share a variety of\nresponsibilities, including investment strategy and analysis, while retaining responsibility for the\nimplementation of the strategy within any particular portfolio. The approach also enables the team to draw\nupon the resources of other groups within SSGA. Each portfolio management team is overseen by SSGA's\ninternal governance. The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of each Fund are:\n                                                                                                            \n  Portfolio Managers                 Fund                                                                   \n  Catherine Pointon, Rodrigo Mora,   SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF                         \n  KhengSiang Ng and Imran Khan                                                                              \n  Richard Darby-Dowman, Paul Brown,  SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF                        \n  PavelKhimchuk and Peter Spano                                                                             \n  James Kramer, Joanna Madden and    SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short   \n  CynthiaMoy                         Term International Treasury Bond ETF, SPDR FTSE                        \n                                     InternationalGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF                   \n                                                                                                            \nPaul Brown is a Vice President and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Team at\nSSGA LTD, having joined the company in 2013.

Additional Purchase and Sale Information Fund Shares are listed for secondary trading on the\nExchange and individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold in the secondary market through a broker-\ndealer. The secondary markets are closed on weekends and also are generally closed on the following\nholidays: New Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Juneteenth National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and\nChristmas Day. The Exchange may close early on the business day before certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to change without notice. If you buy or sell Fund\nShares in the secondary market, you will pay the secondary market price for Fund Shares. In addition, you\nmay incur customary brokerage commissions and charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the bid\nand the offered price in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction.\nThe trading prices of Fund Shares will fluctuate continuously throughout trading hours based on market\nsupply and demand rather than the relevant Fund's net asset value, which is calculated for each Fund once\ndaily as of the close of the regular trading session on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each\nday that such exchange is open. Fund Shares will trade on the Exchange at prices that may be above ( i.e .,\nat a premium) or below ( i.e ., at a discount), to varying degrees, the calculated net asset value of Fund\nShares. The trading prices of Fund Shares may deviate significantly from the relevant Fund's net asset value\nduring periods of market volatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares can be issued and redeemed daily in\nCreation Units, the Adviser believes that large discounts and premiums to net asset value should not be\nsustained over long periods. The Exchange will disseminate, every fifteen seconds during the regular trading\nday, an indicative optimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to each Fund. The IOPV calculations are\nestimates of the value of each Fund's net asset value per Fund Share. Premiums and discounts between the\nIOPV and the market price may occur. This should not be viewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset\nvalue per Fund Share. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the published basket of portfolio\nsecurities and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit and does not necessarily\nreflect the precise composition of a Fund's actual portfolio at a particular point in time. Moreover, the\nIOPV is generally determined by using current market quotations and/or price quotations obtained from\nbroker-dealers and other market intermediaries and valuations based on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the NAV, which (i) is computed only once a day, (ii) unlike the\ncalculation of the IOPV, takes into account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be subject, in accordance with the\nrequirements of the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at different prices than those used in the calculations of\nthe IOPV. The IOPV price is based on quotes and closing prices from the securities' local market converted\ninto U.S. dollars at the current currency rates and may not reflect events that occur subsequent to the\nlocal market's close. Therefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best possible valuation of a Fund's current\nportfolio. Neither the Funds nor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for,\nthe calculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and make no warranty as to their accuracy. The Funds do not\nimpose any restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions; however, the Funds reserve the right\nto reject or limit purchases at any time as described in the SAI. When considering that no restriction or\npolicy was necessary, the Board evaluated the risks posed by market timing activities, such as whether\nfrequent purchases and redemptions would interfere with the efficient implementation of a Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause a Fund to experience increased transaction costs. The Board considered\nthat, unlike traditional mutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and redeemed only in large quantities of\nshares known as Creation Units, available only from a Fund directly, and that most trading in a Fund occurs\non the Exchange at prevailing market prices and does not involve the Fund directly. Given this structure,\nthe Board determined that it is unlikely that (a) market timing would be attempted by a Fund's shareholders\nor (b) any attempts to market time a Fund by shareholders would result in negative impact to the Fund or its\nshareholders. 57 Distributions Dividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are entitled to your\nshare of the applicable Fund's income and net realized gains on its investments. Each Fund pays out\nsubstantially all of its net earnings to its shareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d Each Fund may earn interest\nfrom debt securities and, if participating, securities lending income. Each Fund will generally realize\nshort-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets held for one year or less. Net\nshort-term capital gains will generally be treated as ordinary income when distributed to shareholders. Each\nFund will generally realize long-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets held for\nmore than one year. Net capital gains (the excess of a Fund's net long-term capital gains over its net\nshort-term capital losses) are distributed to shareholders as \u201ccapital gain distributions.\u201d Income dividend\ndistributions, if any, are generally distributed to shareholders monthly, but may vary significantly from\nperiod to period. Net capital gains for each Fund are distributed at least annually. Dividends may be\ndeclared and paid more frequently or at any other time to improve Index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). A portion of each\ndistribution may result in a return of capital. You will be notified regarding the portion of the\ndistribution which represents a return of capital. Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in\nadditional whole Fund Shares only if the broker through whom you purchased Fund Shares makes such option\navailable. Distributions which are reinvested will nevertheless be taxable to the same extent as if such\ndistributions had not been reinvested. Portfolio Holdings Disclosure The Funds' portfolio holdings\ndisclosure policy is described in the SAI. In addition, the identities and quantities of the securities held\nby each Fund are disclosed on the Funds' website. Additional Tax Information The following discussion is a\nsummary of some important U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to an investment in a\nFund. Your investment in a Fund may have other tax implications. Please consult your tax advisor about\nfederal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws applicable to you. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for additional disclosure. Taxes On Distributions. In general, your\ndistributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or\nreinvest them in a Fund. The income dividends and short-term capital gains distributions you receive from\nthe Funds will generally be taxed as ordinary income. Any distributions of a Fund's net capital gains are\ntaxable as long-term capital gain regardless of how long you have owned Fund Shares. Long-term capital gains\nare generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Distributions in excess of a Fund's\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of\nyour basis in the Fund's shares, and, in general, as capital gain thereafter. Since the Funds primarily hold\ninvestments that do not pay dividends, it is not expected that a substantial portion (if any) of the\ndividends paid by a Fund will qualify for either the dividends-received deduction for corporations or the\nfavorable income tax rates available to individuals on qualified dividend income. U.S. individuals with\nincome exceeding specified thresholds are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on all or a portion of\ntheir \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which includes taxable interest, dividends and certain capital gains\n(generally including capital gain distributions and capital gains realized upon the sale of Fund Shares).\nThis 3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of the undistributed net investment income of certain\nshareholders that are estates and trusts. Certain tax-exempt educational institutions will be subject to a\n1.4% tax on net investment income. For these purposes, certain dividends and capital gain distributions, and\ncertain gains from the disposition of Fund Shares (among other categories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net investment income. 58 Distributions paid in January, but\ndeclared by a Fund in October, November or December of the previous year, payable to shareholders of record\nin such a month, may be taxable to you in the calendar year in which they were declared. The Funds will\ninform you of the amount of your ordinary income dividends and capital gain distributions shortly after the\nclose of each calendar year. A distribution will reduce a Fund's net asset value per Fund Share and may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the\ndistribution may constitute a return of capital. Original Issue Discount . Investments by a Fund in zero\ncoupon or other discount securities will result in income to the Fund equal to a portion of the excess face\nvalue of the securities over their issue price (the \u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or \u201cOID\u201d) each year that the\nsecurities are held, even though the Fund may receive no cash interest payments or may receive cash interest\npayments that are less than the income recognized for tax purposes. In other circumstances, whether pursuant\nto the terms of a security or as a result of other factors outside the control of a Fund, a Fund may\nrecognize income without receiving a commensurate amount of cash. A Fund's share of such income is included\nin determining the amount that the Fund must distribute to maintain its eligibility for treatment as a\nregulated investment company and to avoid the payment of federal tax, including the nondeductible 4% excise\ntax. Because any income required to be recognized as a result of the OID and/or market discount rules\n(discussed below) may not be matched by a corresponding cash payment, the Fund may be required to borrow\nmoney or dispose of securities to be able to make distributions to its shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company and eliminate taxes at the Fund level. Inflation-Indexed Bonds.\nSpecial rules apply if a Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest on inflation-\nindexed bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The\namount of any positive inflation adjustment for a taxable year, which results from an increase in the\ninflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. The amount of a Fund's OID in a taxable\nyear with respect to a bond will increase the Fund's taxable income for such year without a corresponding\nreceipt of cash until the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy\nits distribution requirements for such year. The amount of any negative inflation adjustments, which result\nfrom a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in a Fund's income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year; any remaining negative adjustments will be either treated as\nordinary loss or, in certain circumstances, carried forward to reduce the amount of interest income taken\ninto account with respect to the bond in future taxable years. Market Discount. Any market discount\nrecognized on a market discount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond\nacquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or below adjusted issue price if the bond\nwas issued with original issue discount. Absent an election by a Fund to include the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, the gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary\nincome rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the market discount rules is not matched by a corresponding cash receipt by the\nFund, the Fund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to enable the Fund to make\ndistributions to its shareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company and\neliminate taxes at the Fund level, potentially resulting in additional taxable gain or loss to the Fund.\nDerivatives and Other Complex Securities. A Fund may invest in complex securities. These investments may be\nsubject to numerous special and complex rules. These rules could affect whether gains and losses recognized\nby a Fund are treated as ordinary income or capital gain, accelerate the recognition of income to a Fund\nand/or defer a Fund's ability to recognize losses. In turn, these rules may affect the amount, timing or\ncharacter of the income distributed to you by a Fund. You should consult your personal tax advisor regarding\nthe application of these rules. Foreign Currency Transactions. A Fund's transactions in foreign currencies,\nforeign currency denominated debt obligations and certain foreign currency options, futures contracts and\nforward contracts (and similar instruments) may give rise to ordinary income or loss to the extent such\nincome or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned. Foreign Income\nTaxes. Investment income received by a Fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to foreign\nincome taxes withheld at the source. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign\ncountries which may entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of such taxes or exemption from taxes on such income.\nIt is 59 impossible to determine the effective rate of foreign tax for a Fund in advance since the amount of\nthe assets to be invested within various countries is not known. If more than 50% of the total assets of a\nFund at the close of its taxable year consist of certain foreign stocks or securities, the Fund may elect to\n\u201cpass through\u201d to you certain foreign income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. If a Fund\nin which you hold Fund Shares makes such an election, you will be considered to have received as an\nadditional dividend your share of such foreign taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax\ndeduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating\nyour federal income tax. No deduction for such taxes will be permitted to individuals in computing their\nalternative minimum tax liability. If a Fund does not so elect, the Fund will be entitled to claim a\ndeduction for certain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund. Under certain circumstances, if a Fund receives a\nrefund of foreign taxes paid in respect of a prior year, the value of Fund Shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed through to shareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign taxes for\nthe current year could be reduced. Index Concentration . In order to qualify for the favorable tax treatment\ngenerally available to regulated investment companies, a Fund must satisfy certain diversification\nrequirements. In particular, a Fund generally may not acquire a security if, as a result of the acquisition,\nmore than 50% of the value of the Fund's assets would be invested in (a) issuers in which the Fund has, in\neach case, invested more than 5% of the Fund's assets and (b) issuers more than 10% of whose outstanding\nvoting securities are owned by the Fund. Given the concentration of certain indexes tracked by the Funds in\na relatively small number of securities, it may not be possible for such Funds to fully implement a sampling\nmethodology while satisfying these diversification requirements. A Fund's efforts to satisfy the\ndiversification requirements may affect a Fund's execution of its investment strategy and may cause a Fund's\nreturn to deviate from that of the Index, and a Fund's efforts to track the Index may cause it inadvertently\nto fail to satisfy the diversification requirements. If a Fund were to fail to qualify as a RIC, it would be\ntaxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation, and distributions to its shareholders would not be\ndeductible by the Fund in computing its taxable income. Taxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any capital\ngain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund Shares is generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if\nFund Shares have been held for more than one year and as short-term capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have\nbeen held for one year or less, except that any capital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held for six months\nor less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with\nrespect to such Fund Shares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units. A person who exchanges\nsecurities for Creation Units generally will recognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss will be equal to the\ndifference between the market value of the Creation Units at the time and the exchanger's aggregate basis in\nthe securities surrendered plus any cash paid for the Creation Units. A person who exchanges Creation Units\nfor securities will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the exchanger's basis\nin the Creation Units and the aggregate market value of the securities and the amount of cash received. The\nIRS, however, may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the basis that there has been no\nsignificant change in economic position. Persons exchanging securities should consult their own tax advisor\nwith respect to whether wash sale rules apply and when a loss might be deductible. Under current federal tax\nlaws, any capital gain or loss realized upon a redemption (or creation) of Creation Units is generally\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have\nbeen held for more than one year and as a short-term capital gain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for one year or less. If you create or redeem Creation Units, you\nwill be sent a confirmation statement showing how many Fund Shares you purchased or sold and at what price.\nThe Trust on behalf of each Fund has the right to reject an order for Creation Units if the purchaser (or a\ngroup of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding\nshares of the applicable Fund and if, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the applicable Fund would have a\nbasis in the securities different from the market value of the securities on the date of deposit. The Trust\nalso has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of\nthe 80% determination. If the Trust 60 does issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a group of purchasers)\nthat would, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the\napplicable Fund, the purchaser (or group of purchasers) will not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If a Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear additional costs and\nrecognize more capital gains than it would if it redeems Creation Units in-kind. Non-U.S. Investors.\nOrdinary income dividends paid by a Fund to shareholders who are non-resident aliens or foreign entities\nwill generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than distributions reported by the Fund as\ninterest-related dividends and short-term capital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty rate applies or\nunless such income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. In general, a Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of its net income derived from U.S. source interest and a Fund may\nreport short-term capital gain dividends to the extent its net short-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains on the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that are, in each\ncase, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. will generally be\nsubject to U.S. federal net income taxation at regular income tax rates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of a Fund's shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning special tax rules that may apply to their investment. Unless certain non-U.S. entities that hold\nFund Shares comply with IRS requirements that will generally require them to report information regarding\nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts with, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to\ndistributions payable to such entities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the withholding described\nin this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the applicable foreign government comply with the terms of such agreement.\nBackup Withholding. A Fund will be required in certain cases to withhold (as \u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on\namounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund either an incorrect tax identification\nnumber or no number at all, (2) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report\npayments of interest or dividends, (3) has failed to certify to the Fund that such shareholder is not\nsubject to backup withholding, or (4) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will not be applied\nto payments that have been subject to the 30% withholding tax on shareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States. Other Tax Issues. A Fund may be subject to tax in certain states\nwhere the Fund does business (or is treated as doing business as a result of its investments). Furthermore,\nin those states which have income tax laws, the tax treatment of the Funds and of Fund shareholders with\nrespect to distributions by the Funds may differ from federal tax treatment. The foregoing discussion\nsummarizes some of the consequences under current federal income tax law of an investment in the Funds. It\nis not a substitute for personal tax advice. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax\nconsequences of an investment in the Funds under all applicable tax laws. General Information The Trust was\norganized as a Massachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998. If shareholders of any Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled to one vote for each Fund Share they own. Annual meetings of\nshareholders will not be held except as required by the 1940 Act and other applicable law. See the SAI for\nmore information concerning the Trust's form of organization. Management and Organization Each Fund is a\nseparate series of the Trust, which is an open-end registered management investment company. From time to\ntime, a Fund may advertise yield and total return figures. Yield is a historical measure of dividend income,\nand total return is a measure of past dividend income (assuming that it has been reinvested) plus capital\nappreciation. Neither yield nor total return should be used to predict the future performance of a Fund.\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel to the Trust, including the Funds. Ernst & Young LLP serves as\nthe independent registered public accounting firm and will audit the Funds' financial statements annually.\n61 Financial Highlights These financial highlight tables are intended to help you understand each Fund's\nfinancial performance for the past five fiscal years ended December 31. Certain information reflects the\nperformance results for a single Fund Share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an\ninvestor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in each Fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends\nand distributions). This information has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the Trust's independent\nregistered public accounting firm, whose report, along with each Fund's financial highlights and financial\nstatements, are included in each Fund's Form N-CSR filing, which is available upon request. Any references\nto Notes in these financial highlight tables refer to the \u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d section of each\nFund's financial statements, and the financial information included

The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998 and consists of multiple investment series, including the SPDR\nBloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg\nInternational Treasury Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE\nInternational Government Inflation-Protected Bond ETF (each, a \u201c Fund \u201d and, collectively, the \u201c Funds \u201d ).\nThe table below provides the establishment date for each Fund.\n                                                                        \n  Fund Name                                         Establishment Date  \n  SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF    May 29, 2008        \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF   November 17, 2009   \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF    May 31, 2007        \n  SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury  November 28, 2007   \n  BondETF                                                               \n  SPDR FTSE International Government                August 22, 2007     \n  Inflation-ProtectedBond ETF                                           \n                                                                        \nThe offering of each Fund's shares ( \u201c Shares \u201d ) is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended\n(the \u201c Securities Act \u201d ). The investment objective of each Fund is to provide investment results that,\nbefore fees and expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of a specified market\nindex (each an \u201c Index \u201d and together the \u201c Indexes \u201d ). SSGA Funds Management, Inc. serves as the\ninvestment adviser for each Fund ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ). Each Fund offers and issues Shares at\ntheir net asset value (sometimes referred to herein as \u201c NAV \u201d ) only in aggregations of a specified number\nof Shares (each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ). Each Fund generally offers and issues Shares in exchange for (i) a\nbasket of securities designated by the Fund ( \u201c Deposit Securities \u201d ) together with the deposit of a\nspecified cash payment ( \u201c Cash Component \u201d ) or (ii) a cash payment equal in value to the Deposit\nSecurities ( \u201c Deposit Cash \u201d ) together with the Cash Component. The primary consideration accepted by a\nFund (i.e., Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash) is set forth under \u201c Purchase and Redemption of Creation\nUnits \u201d later in this SAI. The Trust reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of a \u201c cash in\nlieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of Deposit Cash (subject to applicable\nlegal requirements). The Shares have been approved for listing and secondary trading on a national\nsecurities exchange (the \u201c Exchange \u201d ). The Shares will trade on the Exchange at market prices. These\nprices may differ from the Shares' net asset values. The Shares are also redeemable only in Creation Unit\naggregations, and generally in exchange for either (i) portfolio securities and a specified cash payment or\n(ii) cash (subject to applicable legal requirements). Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of Deposit\nSecurities subject to various conditions including a requirement to maintain on deposit with the Trust cash\nat least equal to a specified percentage of the market value of the missing Deposit Securities as set forth\nin the Participant Agreement (as defined below). See \u201c Purchase and Redemption of Creation Units. \u201d The\nTrust may impose a transaction fee for each creation or redemption. In all cases, such fees will be limited\nin accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( \u201c SEC \u201d ) applicable to\nmanagement investment companies offering redeemable securities. In addition to the fixed creation or\nredemption transaction fee, an additional transaction fee of up to three times the fixed creation or\nredemption transaction fee and/or an additional variable charge may apply. Investment Policies Each Fund may\ninvest in the following types of investments, consistent with its investment strategies and objective.\nPlease see the Funds' Prospectus for additional information regarding its principal investment strategies.\nDIVERSIFICATION STATUS The SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg International\nTreasury Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International\nGovernment Inflation-Protected Bond ETF are each classified as a \u201c non-diversified \u201d investment company, and\nthe SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF is classified as a \u201c diversified \u201d investment company,\nunder the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, a\n\n3\n\ndiversified investment company, as to 75% of its total assets, may not purchase securities of any issuer\n(other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agents or instrumentalities or\nsecurities of other investment companies) if, as a result, more than 5% of its total assets would be\ninvested in the securities of such issuer, or more than 10% of the issuer's outstanding voting securities\nwould be held by the investment company. A \u201c non-diversified \u201d classification means that a Fund is not\nlimited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities\nof a single issuer. This means that a non-diversified Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the\nsecurities of a single issuer than a diversified fund. The securities of a particular issuer may constitute\na greater portion of an Index of a Fund and, therefore, the securities may constitute a greater portion of\nthe Fund's portfolio. This may have an adverse effect on the Fund's performance or subject the Fund's Shares\nto greater price volatility than more diversified investment companies. Each Fund (whether diversified or\nnon-diversified for purposes of the 1940 Act) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and\notherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a \u201c regulated investment company \u201d ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for\npurposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve\nthe Fund of any liability for federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to\nshareholders. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may severely\nlimit the investment flexibility of a Fund and may make it less likely that the Fund will meet its\ninvestment objective. ASSET-BACKED AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES Asset-backed securities are\nsecurities backed by installment contracts, credit-card receivables or other assets. Commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities are securities backed by commercial real estate properties. Both asset-backed and\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities represent interests in \u201c pools \u201d of assets in which payments of both\ninterest and principal on the securities are made on a regular basis. The payments are, in effect, \u201c passed\nthrough \u201d to the holder of the securities (net of any fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of the\nsecurities). The average life of asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities varies with the\nmaturities of the underlying instruments and, as a result of prepayments, can often be less than the\noriginal maturity of the assets underlying the securities. For this and other reasons, an asset-backed and\ncommercial mortgage-backed security's stated maturity may be shortened, and the security's total return may\nbe difficult to predict precisely. BONDS A bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a company,\ngovernmental unit or, in some cases, a non-U.S. entity. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to\npay interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to repay principal (the bond's face value) periodically\nor on a specified maturity date; provided, however, a zero coupon bond pays no interest to its holder during\nits life. The value of a zero coupon bond to a Fund consists of the difference between such bond's face\nvalue at the time of maturity and the price for which it was acquired, which may be an amount significantly\nless than its face value (sometimes referred to as a \u201c deep discount \u201d price). An issuer may have the right\nto redeem or \u201c call \u201d a bond before maturity, in which case the investor may have to reinvest the proceeds\nat lower market rates. Most bonds bear interest income at a \u201c coupon \u201d rate that is fixed for the life of\nthe bond. The value of a fixed rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when\nmarket interest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed rate bond's yield (income as a percent of the bond's\ncurrent value) may differ from its coupon rate as its value rises or falls. Fixed rate bonds generally are\nalso subject to inflation risk, which is the risk that the value of the bond or income from the bond will be\nworth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. This could mean that, as inflation\nincreases, the \u201c real \u201d value of the assets of a Fund holding fixed rate bonds can decline, as can the value\nof the Fund's distributions. Other types of bonds bear income at an interest rate that is adjusted\nperiodically. Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of \u201c floating-rate \u201d or \u201c variable-rate\n\u201d bonds fluctuates much less in response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed rate\nbonds. A Fund may treat some of these bonds as having a shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the\nweighted average maturity of its investment portfolio. Bonds may be senior or subordinated obligations.\nSenior obligations generally have the first claim on a corporation's earnings and assets and, in the event\nof liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured (backed only by the\nissuer's general creditworthiness) or secured (also backed by specified collateral). The investment return\nof corporate bonds reflects interest on the bond and changes in the market value of the bond. The market\nvalue of a corporate bond may be affected by the credit rating of the corporation, the corporation's\nperformance and perceptions of the corporation in the market place. There is a risk that the issuers of the\nsecurities may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time called\nfor by such a security.\n\n4\n\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER Commercial paper consists of short-term, promissory notes issued by banks, corporations and\nother entities to finance short-term credit needs. These securities generally are discounted but sometimes\nmay be interest bearing. CONCENTRATION Each Fund will concentrate its investments in securities of issuers\nin the same industry as may be necessary to approximate the composition of the Fund's underlying Index. The\nsecurities of issuers in particular industries may dominate the benchmark Index of a Fund and consequently a\nFund's investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a Fund's performance or subject its Shares to greater\nprice volatility than that experienced by less concentrated investment companies. The Trust's general policy\nis to exclude securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities when measuring\nindustry concentration. In pursuing its objective, each Fund may hold the securities of a single issuer in\nan amount exceeding 10% of the market value of the outstanding securities of the issuer, subject to\nrestrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. In particular, as a Fund's size grows and its assets\nincrease, it will be more likely to hold more than 10% of the securities of a single issuer if the issuer\nhas a relatively small public float as compared to other components in its benchmark Index. CONVERTIBLE\nSECURITIES Convertible securities are bonds, debentures, notes, preferred stock or other securities that may\nbe converted or exchanged (by the holder or by the issuer) into shares of the underlying common stock (or\ncash or securities of equivalent value) at a stated exchange ratio. A convertible security may also be\ncalled for redemption or conversion by the issuer after a particular date and under certain circumstances\n(including a specified price) established upon issue. If a convertible security held by a Fund is called for\nredemption or conversion, the Fund could be required to tender it for redemption, convert it into the\nunderlying common stock, or sell it to a third party. Convertible securities generally have less potential\nfor gain or loss than common stock. Convertible securities generally provide yields higher than the\nunderlying common stock, but generally lower than comparable non-convertible securities. Because of this\nhigher yield, convertible securities generally sell at a price above their \u201c conversion value, \u201d which is\nthe current market value of the stock to be received upon conversion. The difference between this conversion\nvalue and the price of convertible securities will vary over time depending on changes in the value of the\nunderlying common stock and interest rates. When the underlying common stock declines in value, convertible\nsecurities will tend not to decline to the same extent because of the interest or dividend payments and the\nrepayment of principal at maturity for certain types of convertible securities. However, securities that are\nconvertible other than at the option of the holder generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same\nextent as securities convertible at the option of the holder. When the underlying common stock rises in\nvalue, the value of convertible securities may also be expected to increase. At the same time, however, the\ndifference between the market value of convertible securities and their conversion value will narrow, which\nmeans that the value of convertible securities will generally not increase to the same extent as the value\nof the underlying common stock. Because convertible securities may also be interest-rate sensitive, their\nvalue may increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Convertible securities are\nalso subject to credit risk, and are often lower-quality securities. EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS Each Fund may\ninvest in other exchange-traded funds ( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) (including ETFs managed by the Adviser). ETFs may be\nstructured as investment companies that are registered under the 1940 Act, typically as open-end funds or\nunit investment trusts. These ETFs are generally based on specific domestic and foreign market securities\nindices. An \u201c index-based ETF \u201d seeks to provide investment results that match the performance of an index\nby holding in its portfolio either the contents of the index or a representative sample of the securities in\nthe index. An \u201c actively-managed ETF \u201d invests in securities based on an adviser's investment strategy. An \u201c\nenhanced ETF \u201d seeks to provide investment results that match a positive or negative multiple of the\nperformance of an underlying index. In seeking to provide such results, an ETF and, in particular, an\nenhanced ETF, may engage in short sales of securities included in the underlying index and may invest in\nderivatives instruments, such as equity index swaps, futures contracts, and options on securities, futures\ncontracts, and stock indices. Alternatively, ETFs may be structured as grantor trusts or other forms of\npooled investment vehicles that are not registered or regulated under the 1940 Act. These ETFs typically\nhold commodities, precious metals, currency or other non-securities investments. ETFs, like mutual funds,\nhave expenses associated with their operation, such as advisory and custody fees. When a Fund invests in an\nETF, in addition to directly bearing expenses associated with its own operations, including the brokerage\ncosts associated with the purchase and sale of shares of the ETF, the Fund will bear a pro rata\n\n5\n\nportion of the ETF's expenses. In addition, it may be more costly to own an ETF than to directly own the\nsecurities or other investments held by the ETF because of ETF expenses. The risks of owning shares of an\nETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities or other investments held by the ETF,\nalthough lack of liquidity in the market for the shares of an ETF could result in the ETF's value being more\nvolatile than the underlying securities or other investments. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Each Fund may\nconduct foreign currency transactions on a spot (i.e., cash) or forward basis (i.e., by entering into\nforward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies). Although foreign exchange dealers generally do\nnot charge a fee for such conversions, they do realize a profit based on the difference between the prices\nat which they are buying and selling various currencies. Thus, a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency\nat one rate, while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the counterparty desire to resell that currency\nto the dealer. Forward contracts are customized transactions that generally require a specific amount of a\ncurrency to be delivered at a specific exchange rate on a specific date or range of dates in the future,\nalthough the Funds may also enter into non-deliverable currency forward contracts ( \u201c NDFs \u201d ) that\ncontractually require the netting of the parties' liabilities. Forwards, including NDFs, can have\nsubstantial price volatility. While foreign currency transactions on a spot and forward basis are exempt\nfrom the definition of \u201c swap \u201d under the Commodity Exchange Act ( \u201c CEA \u201d ), NDFs are not, and, thus, are\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( \u201c CFTC \u201d ). Forward contracts are\ngenerally traded in an interbank market directly between currency traders (usually large commercial banks)\nand their customers. The parties to a forward contract may agree to offset or terminate the contract before\nits maturity, or may hold the contract to maturity and complete the contemplated currency exchange. In the\nevent that the parties to a forward contract agree to offset or terminate the contract before its maturity,\nthe contract is no longer exempt from the definition of \u201c swap \u201d under the CEA and shall be treated as a\nswap. At the discretion of the Adviser, the Funds may enter into forward currency exchange contracts for\nhedging purposes to help reduce the risks and volatility caused by changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates, or to gain exposure to certain currencies in an effort to track the composition of the applicable\nIndex. When used for hedging purposes, they tend to limit any potential gain that may be realized if the\nvalue of a Fund's foreign holdings increases because of currency fluctuations. FUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS\nAND SWAP AGREEMENTS Each Fund may invest in derivatives, including exchange-traded futures on indices,\nexchange-traded futures on Treasuries or Eurodollars, U.S. exchange-traded or OTC put and call options\ncontracts and exchange-traded or OTC swap transactions (including NDFs, interest rate swaps, total return\nswaps, excess return swaps, and credit default swaps). Futures and Options on Futures: Futures contracts\ngenerally provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified commodity or\nsecurity at a specified future time and at a specified price. Index futures contracts are settled daily with\na payment by one party to the other of a cash amount based on the difference between the level of the index\nspecified in the contract from one day to the next. A futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant\nto which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the\nvalue of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the index\ncontract originally was written. Although the value of an index might be a function of the value of certain\nspecified securities, physical delivery of these securities is not always made. A public market exists in\nfutures contracts covering a number of indexes, as well as financial instruments, including, without\nlimitation: U.S. Treasury bonds; U.S. Treasury notes; GNMA Certificates; three-month U.S. Treasury bills;\n90-day commercial paper; bank certificates of deposit; Eurodollar certificates of deposit; the Australian\nDollar; the Canadian Dollar; the British Pound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss Franc; the Mexican Peso; and\ncertain multinational currencies, such as the Euro. It is expected that other futures contracts will be\ndeveloped and traded in the future. Futures contracts are standardized as to maturity date and underlying\ninstrument and are traded on futures exchanges. The Funds may purchase and write (sell) call and put options\non futures. Options on futures give the holder the right, in return for the premium paid, to assume a long\nposition (call) or short position (put) in a futures contract at a specified exercise price upon expiration\nof, or at any time during the period of, the option. Upon exercise of a call option, the holder acquires a\nlong position in the futures contract and the writer is assigned the opposite short position. In the case of\na put option, the opposite is true. A Fund is required to make a good faith margin deposit in cash or U.S.\ngovernment securities (or other eligible collateral) with a broker or custodian to initiate and maintain\nopen positions in futures contracts. A margin deposit is intended to assure completion of the contract\n(delivery or acceptance of the underlying commodity or payment of the cash settlement\n\n6\n\namount) if it is not terminated prior to the specified delivery date. Brokers may establish deposit\nrequirements which are higher than the exchange minimums. Futures contracts are customarily purchased and\nsold on margin deposits which may range upward from less than 5% of the value of the contract being traded.\nAfter a futures contract position is opened, the value of the contract is marked to market daily. If the\nfutures contract price changes to the extent that the margin on deposit does not satisfy price changes,\nadditional payments will be required. Conversely, change in the contract value may reduce the required\nmargin, resulting in a repayment of excess margin to the contract holder. Variation margin payments are made\nto and from the futures broker for as long as the contract remains open. In such case, a Fund would expect\nto earn interest income on its margin deposits. Although some futures contracts call for making or taking\ndelivery of the underlying commodity, generally these obligations are closed out prior to delivery by\noffsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts (involving the same exchange, underlying\ncommodity, security or index and delivery month). If an offsetting purchase price is less than the original\nsale price, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if it is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss.\nConversely, if an offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price, the Fund realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is less, the Fund realizes a capital loss. The transaction costs also must be\nincluded in these calculations. Options: A Fund may purchase and sell put and call options. Such options may\nrelate to particular securities and may or may not be listed on a national securities exchange and issued by\nthe Options Clearing Corporation. Options trading is a highly specialized activity that entails greater than\nordinary investment risk. Options on particular securities may be more volatile than the underlying\nsecurities, and therefore, on a percentage basis, an investment in options may be subject to greater\nfluctuation than an investment in the underlying securities themselves. Short Sales \u201c Against the Box \u201d :\nThe Funds may engage in short sales \u201c against the box. \u201d In a short sale against the box, a Fund agrees to\nsell at a future date a security that it either contemporaneously owns or has the right to acquire at no\nextra cost. If the price of the security has declined at the time the Fund is required to deliver the\nsecurity, the Fund will benefit from the difference in the price. If the price of the security has\nincreased, the Fund will be required to pay the difference. Swap Transactions: Each Fund may enter into swap\ntransactions, including interest rate swap, credit default swap, NDF, and total return swap transactions.\nSwap transactions are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the\nother party based on the change in market value or level of a specified rate, index or asset. In return, the\nother party agrees to make payments to the first party based on the return of a different specified rate,\nindex or asset. Swap transactions will usually be done on a net basis, i.e., where the two parties make net\npayments with a Fund receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. The\nnet amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund's obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis and an amount of cash or equivalents having an aggregate value at least equal to\nthe accrued excess is maintained by the Fund. Swaps may be used in conjunction with other instruments to\noffset interest rate, currency or other underlying risks. For example, interest rate swaps may be offset\nwith \u201c caps, \u201d \u201c floors \u201d or \u201c collars. \u201d A \u201c cap \u201d is essentially a call option which places a limit on the\namount of floating rate interest that must be paid on a certain principal amount. A \u201c floor \u201d is essentially\na put option which places a limit on the minimum amount that would be paid on a certain principal amount. A\n\u201c collar \u201d is essentially a combination of a long cap and a short floor where the limits are set at\ndifferent levels. The use of swap transactions by a Fund entails certain risks, which may be different from,\nor possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the securities and other\ninvestments that are the referenced asset for the swap agreement. Swaps are highly specialized instruments\nthat require investment techniques, risk analyses, and tax planning different from those associated with\nstocks, bonds, and other traditional investments. The use of a swap requires an understanding not only of\nthe referenced asset, reference rate, or index, but also of the swap itself, without the benefit of\nobserving the performance of the swap under all the possible market conditions. Because some swap\ntransactions have a leverage component, adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying asset,\nreference rate, or index can result in a loss substantially greater than the amount invested in the swap\nitself. Certain swaps have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. Bilateral OTC transactions differ from exchange-traded or cleared derivatives transactions in\nseveral respects. Bilateral OTC transactions are transacted directly with dealers and not with a clearing\ncorporation. Without the availability of a clearing corporation, bilateral OTC transaction pricing is\nnormally done by reference to information from market makers and/or available index data, which information\nis carefully monitored by the Adviser and verified in appropriate cases. As bilateral OTC transactions are\nentered into directly with a dealer, there is a risk of nonperformance by the dealer as a result of its\ninsolvency or otherwise. Under regulations adopted by the CFTC and federal banking regulators ( \u201c Margin\nRules \u201d ), a Fund is required to post collateral (known as variation margin) to cover the mark-to-market\nexposure in respect of its uncleared swaps. The Margin Rules also mandate that collateral in the form of\ninitial margin be posted to cover\n\n7\n\npotential future exposure attributable to uncleared swap transactions. In the event a Fund is required to\npost collateral in the form of initial margin or variation margin in respect of its uncleared swap\ntransactions, all such collateral will be posted with a third party custodian pursuant to a triparty custody\nagreement between the Fund, its dealer counterparty and an unaffiliated custodian. The requirement to\nexecute certain OTC derivatives contracts on exchanges or electronic trading platforms called swap execution\nfacilities ( \u201c SEFs \u201d ) may offer certain advantages over traditional bilateral OTC trading, such as ease of\nexecution, price transparency, increased liquidity and/or favorable pricing. However, SEF trading may make\nit more difficult and costly for a Fund to enter into highly tailored or customized transactions and may\nresult in additional costs and risks. Market participants such as the Funds that execute derivatives\ncontracts through a SEF, whether directly or through a broker intermediary, are required to submit to the\njurisdiction of the SEF and comply with SEF and CFTC rules and regulations which impose, among other things\ndisclosure and recordkeeping obligations. In addition, a Fund will generally incur SEF or broker\nintermediary fees when it trades on a SEF. A Fund may also be required to indemnify the SEF or broker\nintermediary for any losses or costs that may result from the Fund's transactions on the SEF. Total Return\nSwaps: A Fund may enter into total return swap transactions for investment purposes. Total return swaps are\ntransactions in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in market value of the\nunderlying assets, which may include a specified security, basket of securities or security indexes during\nthe specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate of the\ntotal return from other underlying assets. Total return swaps may be used to obtain exposure to a security\nor market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or market, including in cases in which\nthere may be disadvantages associated with direct ownership of a particular security. In a typical total\nreturn equity swap, payments made by a Fund or the counterparty are based on the total return of a\nparticular reference asset or assets (such as an equity security, a combination of such securities, or an\nindex). That is, one party agrees to pay another party the return on a stock, basket of stocks, or stock\nindex in return for a specified interest rate. By entering into an equity index swap, for example, the index\nreceiver can gain exposure to stocks making up the index of securities without actually purchasing those\nstocks. Total return swaps involve not only the risk associated with the investment in the underlying\nsecurities, but also the risk of the counterparty not fulfilling its obligations under the agreement. Credit\nDefault Swaps: A Fund may enter into credit default swap transactions for investment purposes. A credit\ndefault swap transaction may have as reference obligations one or more securities that are not currently\nheld by the Fund. A Fund may be either the protection buyer or protection seller in the transaction. Credit\ndefault swaps may also be structured based on the debt of a basket of issuers, rather than a single issuer,\nand may be customized with respect to the default event that triggers purchase or other factors. As a\nprotection seller, a Fund would generally receive an upfront payment or a fixed rate of income throughout\nthe term of the swap, which typically is between six months and three years, provided that there is no\ncredit event. If a credit event occurs, generally the protection seller must pay the protection buyer the\nfull face amount of the reference obligations that may have little or no value. If a Fund were a protection\nbuyer and no credit event occurred during the term of the swap, the Fund would recover nothing if the swap\nwere held through its termination date. However, if a credit event occurred, the protection buyer may elect\nto receive the full notional value of the swap in exchange for an equal face amount of the reference\nobligation that may have little or no value. Where a Fund is the protection buyer, credit default swaps\ninvolve the risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its payment obligations to the Fund in the event of a\ndefault. The purchase of credit default swaps involves costs, which will reduce a Fund's return. Currency\nSwaps: A Fund may enter into currency swap transactions for investment purposes. Currency swaps are similar\nto interest rate swaps, except that they involve multiple currencies. A Fund may enter into a currency swap\nwhen it has exposure to one currency and desires exposure to a different currency. Typically, the interest\nrates that determine the currency swap payments are fixed, although occasionally one or both parties may pay\na floating rate of interest. Unlike an interest rate swap, however, the principal amounts are exchanged at\nthe beginning of the contract and returned at the end of the contract. In addition to paying and receiving\namounts at the beginning and end of the transaction, both sides will have to pay in full on a periodic basis\nbased upon the currency they have borrowed. Change in foreign exchange rates and changes in interest rates,\nas described above, may negatively affect currency swaps. Interest Rate Swaps: A Fund may enter into an\ninterest rate swap in an effort to protect against declines in the value of fixed income securities held by\nthe Fund. In such an instance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed rate (multiplied by a notional amount)\nwhile a counterparty agrees to pay a floating rate (multiplied by the same notional amount). If interest\nrates rise, resulting in a diminution in the value of the Fund's portfolio, the Fund would receive payments\nunder the swap that would offset, in whole or in part, such diminution in value.\n\n8\n\nOptions on Swaps: An option on a swap agreement, or a \u201c swaption, \u201d is a contract that gives a counterparty\nthe right (but not the obligation) to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten, extend, cancel or\notherwise modify an existing swap agreement, at some designated future time on specified terms. In return,\nthe purchaser pays a \u201c premium \u201d to the seller of the contract. The seller of the contract receives the\npremium and bears the risk of unfavorable changes on the underlying swap. A Fund may write (sell) and\npurchase put and call swaptions. A Fund may also enter into swaptions on either an asset-based or liability-\nbased basis, depending on whether the Fund is hedging its assets or its liabilities. A Fund may write (sell)\nand purchase put and call swaptions to the same extent it may make use of standard options on securities or\nother instruments. A Fund may enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a\nparticular investment or portion of its holdings, as a duration management technique, to protect against an\nincrease in the price of securities the Fund anticipates purchasing at a later date, or for any other\npurposes, such as for speculation to increase returns. Swaptions are generally subject to the same risks\ninvolved in a Fund's use of options. Depending on the terms of the particular option agreement, a Fund will\ngenerally incur a greater degree of risk when it writes a swaption than it will incur when it purchases a\nswaption. When a Fund purchases a swaption, it risks losing only the amount of the premium it has paid\nshould it decide to let the option expire unexercised. However, when a Fund writes a swaption, upon exercise\nof the option the Fund will become obligated according to the terms of the underlying agreement. Government\nRegulation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201c Dodd-Frank Act \u201d ) that was\nsigned into law on July 21, 2010 created a new statutory framework that comprehensively regulated the over-\nthe-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) derivatives markets for the first time. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTC\nderivatives markets were traditionally traded on a bilateral basis (so-called \u201c bilateral OTC transactions \u201d\n). Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain OTC derivatives transactions are now required to be centrally cleared\nand traded on SEFs. On October 28, 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 18f-4 (the \u201c Derivatives Rule \u201d ) under the\n1940 Act which replaced prior SEC and staff guidance with an updated, comprehensive framework for registered\nfunds' use of derivatives. The Derivatives Rule permits a Fund to enter into derivatives transactions and\ncertain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under\nSection 18 of the 1940 Act. The Derivatives Rule requires the Funds to trade derivatives and certain other\ninstruments that create future payment or delivery obligations subject to a value-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d )\nleverage limit, develop and implement a derivatives risk management program and new testing requirements,\nand comply with new requirements related to board and SEC reporting. These requirements apply unless a Fund\nqualifies as a \u201c limited derivatives user, \u201d as defined in the Derivatives Rule. Complying with the\nDerivatives Rule may increase the cost of a Fund's investments and cost of doing business, which could\nadversely affect investors. Other new regulations could adversely affect the value, availability and\nperformance of certain derivative instruments, may make them more costly, and may limit or restrict their\nuse by the Funds. Regulation Under the Commodity Exchange Act: Each Fund intends to use commodity interests,\nsuch as futures, swaps and options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the CEA. A Fund may use\nexchange-traded futures and options on futures, together with positions in cash and money market\ninstruments, to simulate full investment in its underlying Index. Exchange-traded futures and options on\nfutures contracts may not be currently available for an Index. Under such circumstances, the Adviser may\nseek to utilize other instruments that it believes to be correlated to the applicable Index components or a\nsubset of the components. An exclusion from the definition of the term \u201c commodity pool operator \u201d has been\nclaimed with respect to each series of the Trust in accordance with Rule 4.5 such that registration or\nregulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA is not necessary. Restrictions on Trading in Commodity\nInterests: Each Fund reserves the right to engage in transactions involving futures, options thereon and\nswaps to the extent allowed by the CFTC regulations in effect from time to time and in accordance with a\nFund's policies. Certain additional risk factors related to derivatives are discussed below: Derivatives\nRisk: Under recently adopted rules by the CFTC, transactions in some types of interest rate swaps and index\ncredit default swaps on North American and European indices are required to be cleared. In addition, the\nCFTC may promulgate additional regulations that require clearing of other classes of swaps. In a cleared\nderivatives transaction (which includes futures, options on futures, and cleared swaps transactions), a\nFund's counterparty is a clearing house (such as CME, ICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet), rather than a bank\nor broker. Since each Fund is not a member of a clearing house and only members of a clearing house can\nparticipate directly in the clearing house, a Fund holds cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers, who are futures commission merchants that are members of the clearing houses and who have the\nappropriate regulatory\n\n9\n\napprovals to engage in cleared derivatives transactions. A Fund makes and receives payments owed under\ncleared derivatives transactions (including margin payments) through its accounts at clearing members.\nClearing members guarantee performance of their clients' obligations to the clearing house. In contrast to\nbilateral OTC transactions, clearing members generally can require termination of existing cleared\nderivatives transactions at any time and increases in margin above the margin that it required at the\nbeginning of a transaction. Clearing houses also have broad rights to increase margin requirements for\nexisting transactions and to terminate transactions in accordance with their rules. Any such increase or\ntermination could interfere with the ability of a Fund to pursue its investment strategy. Also, a Fund is\nsubject to execution risk if it enters into a derivatives transaction that is required to be cleared (or\nthat the Advisor expects to be cleared), and no clearing member is willing or able to clear the transaction\non the Fund's behalf. While the documentation in place between a Fund and its clearing members generally\nprovides that the clearing members will accept for clearing all transactions submitted for clearing that are\nwithin credit limits specified by the clearing members in advance, the Fund could be subject to this\nexecution risk if the Fund submits for clearing transactions that exceed such credit limits, if the clearing\nhouse does not accept the transactions for clearing, or if the clearing members do not comply with their\nagreement to clear such transactions. In that case, the transaction might have to be terminated, and the\nFund could lose some or all of the benefit of any increase in the value of the transaction after the time of\nthe transaction. In addition, new regulations could, among other things, restrict a Fund's ability to engage\nin, or increase the cost to the Fund of, derivatives transactions, for example, by making some types of\nderivatives no longer available to the Fund or increasing margin or capital requirements. If a Fund is not\nable to enter into a particular derivatives transaction, the Fund's investment performance and risk profile\ncould be adversely affected as a result. Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk with respect to OTC\nderivatives may be affected by new regulations promulgated by the CFTC and SEC affecting the derivatives\nmarket. As described under \u201c Derivatives Risk \u201d above, all futures and options on futures and some swap\ntransactions are required to be cleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives transaction is subject to the\ncredit risk of the clearing house and the clearing member through which it holds its cleared derivatives\nposition, rather than the credit risk of its original counterparty to the derivative transaction. Clearing\nmembers are required to segregate all funds received from customers with respect to cleared derivatives\ntransactions from the clearing member's proprietary assets. However, all funds and other property received\nby a clearing broker from its customers are generally held by the clearing broker on a commingled basis in\nan omnibus account, and the clearing broker may also invest those funds in certain instruments permitted\nunder the applicable regulations. Also, the clearing member transfers to the clearing house the amount of\nmargin required by the clearing house for cleared derivatives transactions, which amounts are generally held\nin the relevant omnibus account at the clearing house for all customers of the clearing member. For\ncommodities futures positions, the clearing house may use all of the collateral held in the clearing\nmember's omnibus account to meet a loss in that account, without regard to which customer in fact supplied\nthat collateral. Accordingly, in addition to bearing the credit risk of its clearing member, each customer\nto a futures transaction also bears \u201c fellow customer \u201d risk from other customers of the clearing member.\nHowever, with respect to cleared swaps positions, recent regulations promulgated by the CFTC require that\nthe clearing member notify the clearing house of the amount of initial margin provided by the clearing\nmember to the clearing house that is attributable to each customer. Because margin in respect of cleared\nswaps must be earmarked for specific clearing member customers, the clearing house may not use the\ncollateral of one customer to cover the obligations of another customer. However, if the clearing member\ndoes not provide accurate reporting, a Fund is subject to the risk that a clearing house will use the Fund's\nassets held in an omnibus account at the clearing house to satisfy payment obligations of a defaulting\ncustomer of the clearing member to the clearing house. In addition, clearing members may generally choose to\nprovide to the clearing house the net amount of variation margin required for cleared swaps for all of its\ncustomers in the aggregate, rather than the gross amount for each customer. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS A Fund may\ntake advantage of opportunities in the area of options and futures contracts, options on futures contracts,\nwarrants, swaps and any other investments which are not presently contemplated for use by the Fund or which\nare not currently available but which may be developed, to the extent such opportunities are both consistent\nwith the Fund's investment objective and legally permissible for the Fund. Before entering into such\ntransactions or making any such investment, a Fund will provide appropriate disclosure.\n\n10\n\nHIGH YIELD SECURITIES Investment in high yield securities (commonly known as \u201c junk \u201d bonds) generally\nprovides greater income and increased opportunity for capital appreciation than investments in higher\nquality securities, but they also typically entail greater price volatility and credit risk. These high\nyield securities are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability\nto meet principal and interest payments. Analysis of the creditworthiness of issuers of debt securities that\nare high yield may be more complex than for issuers of higher quality debt securities. In addition, high\nyield securities are often issued by smaller, less creditworthy companies or by highly leveraged (indebted)\nfirms, but can also be issued by governments. Such issuers are generally less able than more financially\nstable issuers to make scheduled payments of interest and principal. The risks posed by securities issued\nunder such circumstances are substantial. Investing in high yield debt securities involves risks that are\ngreater than the risks of investing in higher quality debt securities. These risks include: (i) changes in\ncredit status, including weaker overall credit conditions of issuers and risks of default; (ii) industry,\nmarket and economic risk; and (iii) greater price variability and credit risks of certain high yield\nsecurities such as zero coupon and payment-in-kind securities. While these risks provide the opportunity for\nmaximizing return over time, they may result in greater volatility of the value of a Fund than a fund that\ninvests in higher-rated securities. Furthermore, the value of high yield securities may be more susceptible\nto real or perceived adverse economic, company or industry conditions than is the case for higher quality\nsecurities. The market values of certain of these lower-rated and unrated debt securities tend to reflect\nindividual issuer developments to a greater extent than do higher-rated securities which react primarily to\nfluctuations in the general level of interest rates, and tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions\nthan are higher-rated securities. Adverse market, credit or economic conditions could make it difficult at\ncertain times to sell certain high yield securities held by a Fund. The secondary market on which high yield\nsecurities are traded may be less liquid than the market for higher grade securities. Less liquidity in the\nsecondary trading market could adversely affect the price at which a Fund could sell a high yield security,\nand could adversely affect the daily net asset value per share of a Fund. When secondary markets for high\nyield securities are less liquid than the market for higher grade securities, it may be more difficult to\nvalue the securities because there is less reliable, objective data available. The use of credit ratings as\na principal method of selecting high yield securities can involve certain risks. For example, credit ratings\nevaluate the safety of principal and interest payments, not the market value risk of high yield securities.\nAlso, credit rating agencies may fail to change credit ratings in a timely fashion to reflect events since\nthe security was last rated. ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS Each Fund may invest in illiquid investments. A Fund may\nnot acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment means any investment that a Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less\nwithout the sale or disposition significantly changing the market value of the investment. If illiquid\ninvestments exceed 15% of a Fund's net assets, certain remedial actions will be taken as required by Rule\n22e-4 under the 1940 Act and the Funds' policies and procedures. INFLATION-PROTECTED OBLIGATIONS Each Fund\nmay invest in inflation-protected public obligations, commonly known as \u201c TIPS, \u201d of the U.S. Treasury, as\nwell as TIPS of major governments and emerging market countries, excluding the United States. TIPS are a\ntype of security issued by a government that are designed to provide inflation protection to investors. TIPS\nare income-generating instruments whose interest and principal payments are adjusted for inflation\u2014a\nsustained increase in prices that erodes the purchasing power of money. The inflation adjustment, which is\ntypically applied monthly to the principal of the bond, follows a designated inflation index, such as the\nConsumer Price Index. A fixed coupon rate is applied to the inflation-adjusted principal so that as\ninflation rises or falls, both the principal value and the interest payments will increase or decrease. This\ncan provide investors with a hedge against inflation, as it helps preserve the purchasing power of an\ninvestment. Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation-protected bonds typically have lower\nyields than conventional fixed-rate bonds.\n\n11\n\nINVESTMENT COMPANIES Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies, including\naffiliated funds and money market funds, subject to applicable limitations under Section 12(d)(1) of the\n1940 Act. Pursuant to Section 12(d)(1), a Fund may invest in the securities of another investment company\n(the \u201c acquired company \u201d ) provided that the Fund, immediately after such purchase or acquisition, does not\nown in the aggregate: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company; (ii)\nsecurities issued by the acquired company having an aggregate value in excess of 5% of the value of the\ntotal assets of the Fund; or (iii) securities issued by the acquired company and all other investment\ncompanies (other than Treasury stock of the Fund) having an aggregate value in excess of 10% of the value of\nthe total assets of the Fund. To the extent allowed by law, regulation, and/or a Fund's investment\nrestrictions, a Fund may invest its assets in securities of investment companies, including affiliated funds\nand/or money market funds, in excess of the limits discussed above. If a Fund invests in and, thus, is a\nshareholder of, another investment company, the Fund's shareholders will indirectly bear the Fund's\nproportionate share of the fees and expenses paid by such other investment company, including advisory fees,\nin addition to both the management fees payable directly by the Fund to the Fund's own investment adviser\nand the other expenses that the Fund bears directly in connection with the Fund's own operations. LENDING\nPORTFOLIO SECURITIES Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain creditworthy borrowers in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. markets in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets. The borrowers provide\ncollateral that is marked to market daily in an amount at least equal to the current market value of the\nsecurities loaned. A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the securities loaned. A Fund receives\nthe value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned securities. A Fund cannot\nvote proxies for securities on loan, but may recall loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the\nFund's economic interest in the investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to recall such securities promptly\nmay be unsuccessful, especially for foreign securities or thinly traded securities. Distributions received\non loaned securities in lieu of dividend payments (i.e., substitute payments) would not be considered\nqualified dividend income. With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be\nentitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. A Fund is compensated by the difference\nbetween the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the\ncase of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a\npercentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain\nhigh quality short-term instruments either directly on behalf of the lending Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or funds, which may include those managed by the Adviser. A Fund could lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or any investments made with cash\ncollateral. Certain non-cash collateral or investments made with cash collateral may have a greater risk of\nloss than other non-cash collateral or investments. A Fund may pay a portion of the interest or fees earned\nfrom securities lending to a borrower as described above, and to one or more securities lending agents\napproved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201c Board \u201d ) who administer the lending program for the\nFunds in accordance with guidelines approved by the Board. In such capacity, the lending agent provides the\nfollowing services to the Funds in connection with the Funds' securities lending activities: (i) locating\nborrowers among an approved list of prospective borrowers; (ii) causing the delivery of loaned securities\nfrom a Fund to borrowers; (iii) monitoring the value of loaned securities, the value of collateral received,\nand other lending parameters; (iv) seeking additional collateral, as necessary, from borrowers; (v)\nreceiving and holding collateral from borrowers, and facilitating the investment and reinvestment of all or\nsubstantially all cash collateral in an investment vehicle designated by the Funds; (vi) returning\ncollateral to borrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute dividend, interest, and other distribution payments\nto the Funds from borrowers; (viii) negotiating the terms of each loan of securities, including but not\nlimited to the amount of any loan premium, and monitoring the terms of securities loan agreements with\nprospective borrowers for consistency with the requirements of the Funds' Securities Lending Authorization\nAgreement; (ix) selecting securities, including amounts (percentages), to be loaned; (x) recordkeeping and\naccounting servicing; and (xi) arranging for return of loaned securities to the Fund in accordance with the\nterms of the Securities Lending Authorization Agreement. State Street Bank and Trust Company ( \u201c State\nStreet \u201d ), an affiliate of the Trust, has been approved by the Board to serve as securities lending agent\nfor the Funds and the Trust has entered into an agreement with State Street for such services. Among other\nmatters, the Trust has agreed to indemnify State Street for certain liabilities. State Street has received\nan order of exemption from the SEC under Sections 17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the 1940 Act to serve as the\nlending agent for affiliated investment companies such as the Trust and to invest the cash collateral\nreceived from loan transactions to be invested in an affiliated cash collateral fund.\n\n12\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses\nresulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process especially so in certain international\nmarkets such as Taiwan), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), risk of loss of collateral, credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject\nto the risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a\npossible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund's securities as\nagreed, the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction\ncosts incurred in purchasing replacement securities. Although State Street has agreed to provide a Fund with\nindemnification in the event of a borrower default, a Fund is still exposed to the risk of losses in the\nevent a borrower does not return a Fund's securities as agreed. For example, delays in recovery of lent\nsecurities may cause a Fund to lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable price. LEVERAGING\nWhile the Funds do not anticipate doing so, a Fund may borrow money in an amount greater than 5% of the\nvalue of the Fund's total assets. However, under normal circumstances, a Fund will not borrow money from a\nbank in an amount greater than 10% of the value of the Fund's total assets. Borrowing for investment\npurposes is one form of leverage. Leveraging investments, by purchasing securities with borrowed money, is a\nspeculative technique that increases investment risk, but also increases investment opportunity. Because\nsubstantially all of a Fund's assets will fluctuate in value, whereas the interest obligations on borrowings\nmay be fixed, the NAV of a Fund will increase more when such Fund's portfolio assets increase in value and\ndecrease more when the Fund's portfolio assets decrease in value than would otherwise be the case. Moreover,\ninterest costs on borrowings may fluctuate with changing market rates of interest and may partially offset\nor exceed the returns on the borrowed funds. OTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS Each Fund may invest in short-term\ninstruments, including money market instruments, (including money market funds advised by the Adviser), cash\nand cash equivalents, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term investments that may include but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by the Adviser); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c CDs \u201d ), bankers' acceptances, fixed time deposits and other\nobligations of U.S. and foreign banks (including foreign branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial\npaper rated at the date of purchase \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by Moody's Investors Service ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ) or \u201c A-1 \u201d by\nS&P Global Ratings ( \u201c S&P \u201d ), or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by the Adviser; (v) non-\nconvertible corporate debt securities (e.g., bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of\npurchase of not more than 397 days and that present minimal credit risk; and (vi) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of foreign banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of the Adviser, are\nof comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks which may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or a forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable\ndeposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers'\nacceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international\ntransactions. Money market instruments also include shares of money market funds. The SEC and other\ngovernment agencies continue to review the regulation of money market funds. The SEC has adopted changes to\nthe rules that govern money market funds over the years, most recently in July 2023. Legislative\ndevelopments may also affect money market funds. These changes and developments may affect the investment\nstrategies, performance, yield, operating expenses and continued viability of a money market fund. PRIVATE\nPLACEMENTS AND RESTRICTED SECURITIES Each Fund may invest in securities that are purchased in private\nplacements and, accordingly, are subject to restrictions on resale as a matter of contract or under federal\nsecurities laws. While such private placements may offer attractive opportunities for investment not\notherwise available on the open market, the securities so purchased are often \u201c restricted securities, \u201d\ni.e., securities which cannot be sold to the public without registration under the Securities Act or the\navailability of an exemption from registration (such as Rules 144 or 144A), or which are not readily\nmarketable because they are subject to other legal or contractual delays in or restrictions on resale.\nGenerally speaking, restricted securities may be\n\n13\n\nsold only to qualified institutional buyers, or in a privately negotiated transaction to a limited number of\npurchasers, or in limited quantities after they have been held for a specified period of time and other\nconditions are met pursuant to an exemption from registration, or in a public offering for which a\nregistration statement is in effect under the Securities Act. Because there may be relatively few potential\npurchasers for such investments, especially under adverse market or economic conditions or in the event of\nadverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer, a Fund could find it more difficult to sell such\nsecurities when the Adviser believes it advisable to do so or may be able to sell such securities only at\nprices lower than if such securities were more widely held. Market quotations for such securities are\ngenerally less readily available than for publicly traded securities. The absence of a trading market can\nmake it difficult to ascertain a market value for such securities for purposes of computing a Fund's net\nasset value, and the judgment of the Adviser may at times play a greater role in valuing these securities\nthan in the case of publicly traded securities. Disposing of such securities, which may be illiquid\ninvestments, can involve time-consuming negotiation and legal expenses, and it may be difficult or\nimpossible for a Fund to sell them promptly at an acceptable price. A Fund may have to bear the extra\nexpense of registering such securities for resale and the risk of substantial delay in effecting such\nregistration. A Fund may be deemed to be an \u201c underwriter \u201d for purposes of the Securities Act when selling\nrestricted securities to the public, and in such event the Fund may be liable to purchasers of such\nsecurities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer, or the prospectus forming a part of it, is\nmaterially inaccurate or misleading. RATINGS An investment grade rating means the security or issuer is\nrated investment grade by Moody's, S&P, Fitch Ratings, Inc. ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ), Morningstar DBRS, or another\ncredit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization by the SEC, or is\nunrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by the Adviser. Subsequent to purchase by a Fund, a rated\nsecurity may cease to be rated or its investment grade rating may be reduced below an investment grade\nrating. Bonds rated lower than Baa3 by Moody's or BBB- by S&P or Fitch are below investment grade quality\nand are obligations of issuers that are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's\ncapacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of the obligation and, therefore, carry\ngreater investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and increased market\nprice volatility. Such securities ( \u201c lower rated securities \u201d ) are commonly referred to as \u201c junk \u201d bonds\nand are subject to a substantial degree of credit risk. Lower rated securities are often issued by smaller,\nless creditworthy companies or by highly leveraged (indebted) firms, which are generally less able than more\nfinancially stable firms to make scheduled payments of interest and principal. The risks posed by securities\nissued under such circumstances are substantial. Bonds rated below investment-grade tend to be less\nmarketable than higher-quality bonds because the market for them is less broad. The market for unrated bonds\nis even narrower. See \u201c HIGH YIELD SECURITIES \u201d above for more information relating to the risks associated\nwith investing in lower rated securities, or Appendix A for more information on the ratings of debt\ninstruments. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS Each Fund may invest in repurchase agreements with commercial banks,\nbrokers or dealers to generate income from its excess cash balances and to invest securities lending cash\ncollateral. A repurchase agreement is an agreement under which a Fund acquires a financial instrument (e.g.,\na security issued by the U.S. government or an agency thereof, a banker's acceptance or a certificate of\ndeposit) from a seller, subject to resale to the seller at an agreed upon price and date (normally, the next\nBusiness Day\u2014as defined below). A repurchase agreement may be considered a loan collateralized by\nsecurities. The resale price reflects an agreed upon interest rate effective for the period the instrument\nis held by a Fund and is unrelated to the interest rate on the underlying instrument. In these repurchase\nagreement transactions, the securities acquired by a Fund (including accrued interest earned thereon) must\nhave a total value in excess of the value of the repurchase agreement and are held by the Custodian until\nrepurchased. No more than an aggregate of 15% of a Fund's net assets will be invested in illiquid\ninvestments, including repurchase agreements having maturities longer than seven days and securities subject\nto legal or contractual restrictions on resale, or for which there are no readily available market\nquotations. The use of repurchase agreements involves certain risks. For example, if the other party to the\nagreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying security at a time when the value of the\nsecurity has declined, a Fund may incur a loss upon disposition of the security. If the other party to the\nagreement becomes insolvent and subject to liquidation or\n\n14\n\nreorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other laws, a court may determine that the underlying\nsecurity is collateral for a loan by a Fund not within the control of the Fund and, therefore, the Fund may\nnot be able to substantiate its interest in the underlying security and may be deemed an unsecured creditor\nof the other party to the agreement. REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS Each Fund may enter into reverse\nrepurchase agreements, which involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities\nat an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. The securities\npurchased with the funds obtained from the agreement and securities collateralizing the agreement will have\nmaturity dates no later than the repayment date. Generally the effect of such transactions is that a Fund\ncan recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases a Fund is able to keep some of the interest income\nassociated with those securities. Such transactions are only advantageous if a Fund has an opportunity to\nearn a greater rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions than the interest cost of\nobtaining the same amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to\nor greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available and a Fund intends to use the\nreverse repurchase technique only when the Adviser believes it will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of\nreverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any interim increase or decrease in the value of a Fund's\nassets. A Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements if it either meets the relevant asset coverage\nrequirements of Section 18 of the 1940 Act for senior securities representing indebtedness, or elects to\ntreat such arrangements as derivatives transactions under the Derivatives Rule. Each Fund does not expect to\nengage, under normal circumstances, in reverse repurchase agreements with respect to more than 10% of its\ntotal assets. SOVEREIGN DEBT OBLIGATIONS Sovereign debt obligations are issued or guaranteed by foreign\ngovernments or their agencies. Sovereign debt may be in the form of conventional securities or other types\nof debt instruments such as loans or loan participations. Governmental entities responsible for repayment of\nthe debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal and pay interest when due, and may require\nrenegotiation or reschedule of debt payments. In addition, prospects for repayment of principal and payment\nof interest may depend on political as well as economic factors. Although some sovereign debt, such as Brady\nBonds, is collateralized by U.S. Government securities, repayment of principal and payment of interest is\nnot guaranteed by the U.S. Government. U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS U.S. Government obligations are a type of\nbond. U.S. Government obligations include securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by\nthe U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities. One type of U.S. Government obligation, U.S.\nTreasury obligations, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury and differ only in their\ninterest rates, maturities, and times of issuance. U.S. Treasury bills have initial maturities of one-year\nor less; U.S. Treasury notes have initial maturities of one to ten years; and U.S. Treasury bonds generally\nhave initial maturities of greater than ten years. Other U.S. Government obligations are issued or\nguaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. Government including, but not limited to, Federal\nNational Mortgage Association ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ), the Government National Mortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie\nMae \u201d ), the Small Business Administration, the Federal Farm Credit Administration, the Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Corporation ( \u201c Freddie Mac \u201d ), the Federal Home Loan Banks ( \u201c FHLB \u201d ), Banks for Cooperatives\n(including the Central Bank for Cooperatives), the Federal Land Banks, the Federal Intermediate Credit\nBanks, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Commodity Credit\nCorporation, the Federal Financing Bank, the Student Loan Marketing Association, the National Credit Union\nAdministration and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac). Some obligations issued or\nguaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and instrumentalities, including, for example, Ginnie Mae pass-\nthrough certificates, are supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. Other obligations\nissued by or guaranteed by federal agencies, such as those securities issued by Fannie Mae, are supported by\nthe discretionary authority of the U.S. Government to purchase certain obligations of the federal agency,\nwhile other obligations issued by or guaranteed by federal agencies, such as those of the Federal Home Loan\nBanks, are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury. While the U.S. Government\nprovides financial support to such U.S. Government-sponsored federal agencies, no assurance can be given\nthat the U.S. Government will always do so, since the U.S. Government is not so obligated by law.\n\n15\n\nIn September 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, placing the\ntwo federal instrumentalities in conservatorship. Under the terms of the takeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed\nto acquire $1 billion of senior preferred stock of each instrumentality and obtained warrants for the\npurchase of common stock of each instrumentality. Under these Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements ( \u201c\nSPAs \u201d ), the U.S. Treasury has pledged to provide a limited amount of capital per instrumentality as\nneeded, including the contribution of cash capital to the instrumentalities in the event their liabilities\nexceed their assets. In May 2009, the U.S. Treasury increased its maximum commitment to each instrumentality\nunder the SPAs from $100 billion to $200 billion per instrumentality. In December 2009, the U.S. Treasury\namended the SPAs to provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with some additional flexibility to meet the\nrequirement to reduce their mortgage portfolios. Also in December 2009, the U.S. Treasury further amended\nthe SPAs to allow the cap on the U.S. Treasury's funding commitment to increase as necessary to accommodate\nany cumulative reduction in Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's net worth through the end of 2012. On August 17,\n2012, the U.S. Treasury announced that it was again amending the SPAs to terminate the requirement that\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac each pay a 10% dividend annually on all amounts received under the funding\ncommitment. Instead, they were required to transfer to the U.S. Treasury on a quarterly basis all profits\nearned during a quarter that exceeded a capital reserve amount of $3 billion. On September 30, 2019, the\nU.S. Treasury announced amendments to the SPAs permitting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to maintain capital\nreserves of $25 billion and $20 billion, respectively. It is believed that the amendment puts Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac in a better position to service their debt because the companies no longer have to borrow from\nthe U.S. Treasury to make fixed dividend payments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the subject of several\ncontinuing class action lawsuits and investigations by federal regulators over certain accounting,\ndisclosure or corporate governance matters, which (along with any resulting financial restatements) may\nadversely affect the guaranteeing entities. Importantly, the future of the entities is in serious question\nas the U.S. government reportedly is considering multiple options, ranging from nationalization,\nprivatization, consolidation, or abolishment of the entities. VARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES Variable\nrate securities are instruments issued or guaranteed by entities such as (1) U.S. Government, or an agency\nor instrumentality thereof, (2) states, municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies,\nauthorities and instrumentalities or states and multi-state agencies or authorities, (3) corporations, (4)\nfinancial institutions, (5) insurance companies or (6) trusts that have a rate of interest subject to\nadjustment at regular intervals but less frequently than annually. A variable rate security provides for the\nautomatic establishment of a new interest rate on set dates. Variable rate obligations whose interest is\nreadjusted no less frequently than annually will be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining\nuntil the next readjustment of the interest rate. A Fund may also purchase floating rate securities. A\nfloating rate security provides for the automatic adjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified\ninterest rate changes. Interest rates on these securities are ordinarily tied to, and are a percentage of, a\nwidely recognized interest rate, such as the yield on 90-day U.S. Treasury bills or the prime rate of a\nspecified bank. These rates may change as often as twice daily. Generally, changes in interest rates will\nhave a smaller effect on the market value of variable and fixed rate floating rate securities than on the\nmarket value of comparable fixed rate fixed income obligations. Thus, investing in variable and fixed rate\nfloating rate securities generally allows less opportunity for capital appreciation and depreciation than\ninvesting in comparable fixed rate fixed income securities. VARIABLE RATE DEMAND OBLIGATIONS Variable rate\ndemand obligations ( \u201c VRDOs \u201d ) are short-term tax-exempt fixed income instruments whose yield is reset on\na periodic basis. VRDO securities tend to be issued with long maturities of up to 30 or 40 years; however,\nthey are considered short-term instruments because they include a put feature which coincides with the\nperiodic yield reset. For example, a VRDO whose yield resets weekly will have a put feature that is\nexercisable upon seven days' notice. VRDOs are put back to a bank or other entity that serves as a liquidity\nprovider, who then tries to resell the VRDOs or, if unable to resell, holds them in its own inventory. VRDOs\nare generally supported by either a Letter of Credit or a Stand-by Bond Purchase Agreement to provide credit\nenhancement.\n\n16\n\nWHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES Each Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued basis. Delivery of and payment for\nthese securities may take place as long as a month or more after the date of the purchase commitment. The\nvalue of these securities is subject to market fluctuation during this period, and no income accrues to a\nFund until settlement takes place. When entering into a when-issued transaction, a Fund will rely on the\nother party to consummate the transaction; if the other party fails to do so, a Fund may be disadvantaged.\nSecurities purchased on a when-issued basis and held by a Fund are subject to changes in market value based\nupon actual or perceived changes in the level of interest rates. Generally, the value of such securities\nwill fluctuate inversely to changes in interest rates \u2014 i.e., they will appreciate in value when interest\nrates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise. Therefore, if a Fund purchases securities on a\n\u201c when-issued \u201d basis, there may be a greater possibility of fluctuation in the Fund's NAV. Special\nConsiderations and Risks A discussion of the risks associated with an investment in each Fund is contained\nin the Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the Prospectus.\nGENERAL Investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of a Fund's portfolio\nsecurities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the\nportfolio securities, the value of securities generally and other factors. An investment in a Fund should\nalso be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in securities, including the risk\nthat the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of the securities\nmarkets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and\nthus in the value of Shares). Securities are susceptible to general market fluctuations and to volatile\nincreases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors including expectations regarding\ngovernment, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or\ncontraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises. Securities of issuers traded on\nexchanges may be suspended on certain exchanges by the issuers themselves, by an exchange or by government\nauthorities. The likelihood of such suspensions may be higher for securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than in countries with more developed markets. Trading suspensions may be applied\nfrom time to time to the securities of individual issuers for reasons specific to that issuer, or may be\napplied broadly by exchanges or governmental authorities in response to market events. Suspensions may last\nfor significant periods of time, during which trading in the securities and instruments that reference the\nsecurities, such as participatory notes (or \u201c P-notes \u201d ) or other derivative instruments, may be halted.\nThe principal trading market for some of the securities in an Index may be in the over-the-counter market.\nThe existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend on whether dealers will make a\nmarket in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or maintained or that any\nsuch market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a Fund's\nShares will be adversely affected if trading markets for a Fund's portfolio securities are limited or absent\nor if bid/ask spreads are wide. CHINA BOND RISK Certain Funds may invest in renminbi ( \u201c RMB \u201d ) denominated\nfixed income securities of Chinese issuers ( \u201c China bonds \u201d ). To the extent a Fund's underlying Index\nincludes China bonds, the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective is dependent on its continued\naccess to such bonds. The Funds may invest in China bonds (i) through direct access to the China Interbank\nBond Market ( \u201c CIBM \u201d ), (ii) through certain foreign institutional investors that have obtained a license\nfrom the Chinese regulators, and (iii) through Bond Connect, a program that provides foreign investors with\naccess to China's onshore bond market. CIBM Direct Access Program Risks: The CIBM is an OTC market\nestablished in 1997, and accounts for more than 95% of outstanding bond values of the total trading volume\nin the People's Republic of China (the \u201c PRC \u201d ). On CIBM, domestic institutional investors and certain\nforeign institutional investors can trade, on a one-to-one quote-driven basis, sovereign bonds, government\nbonds, corporate bonds, bond repo, bond lending, bills issued by the People's Bank of China\n\n17\n\n( \u201c PBOC \u201d ) and other financial debt instruments. Pursuant to the Announcement (2016) No. 3 issued by the\nPBOC on February 24, 2016, eligible foreign institutional investors can conduct trading on the CIBM under a\nprogram established by the PBOC ( \u201c CIBM Direct Access Program \u201d ) subject to other rules and regulations as\npromulgated by the PRC authorities. There is no trading quota limitation. CIBM is regulated and supervised\nby the PBOC. The PBOC is responsible for, among others, promulgating the applicable CIBM listing, trading\nand operating rules, and supervising the market operators of CIBM. Bonds and bond-related derivatives are\ntraded in the CIBM primarily through (i) independent bilateral negotiation on a transaction by transaction\nbasis or (ii) through the \u201c click-and-deal \u201d trading model, whereby a party offers a quote in the market\nthat can then be accepted by a counterparty (thus, \u201c clicking \u201d the \u201c deal \u201d ). A \u201c click-and-deal \u201d quote\nmay also be automatically matched with a price limit order. In addition, recently an \u201c anonymous click \u201d\ntrading model has been implemented for certain bonds and bond-related derivatives whereby anonymous quotes\noffered in the market are automatically matched with counterparties based on timing and price. Once a\ntransaction is agreed upon, the parties will, in accordance with the terms of the transaction, promptly send\ninstructions for the delivery of bonds and funds. Parties are required to have sufficient bonds and funds\nfor delivery on the agreed upon delivery date. China Central Depository & Clearing Co., Ltd ( \u201c CCDC \u201d ) or\nShanghai Clearing House ( \u201c SHCH \u201d ) will deliver bonds according to the instructions sent by the parties.\nFunds clearing banks will handle the transfer and settlement of the payments of the bonds on behalf of the\nparties. The China Foreign Exchange Trading System is the unified trading platform for CIBM. A Fund's\ninvestments in China bonds through the CIBM Direct Access Program will be subject to a number of additional\nrisks and restrictions that may affect the Fund's investments and returns. Certain of these risks are\ndiscussed below. The CIBM Direct Access Program is relatively new. Laws, rules, regulations, policies,\nnotices, circulars or guidelines relating to the CIBM Direct Access Program as published or applied by the\nPBOC and other PRC authorities are relatively untested and are subject to change from time to time. There\ncan be no assurance that the CIBM Direct Access Program will not be restricted, suspended or abolished. If\nsuch event occurs, a Fund's ability to invest in the CIBM through the CIBM Direct Access Program will be\nadversely affected, and if the Fund is unable to adequately access the CIBM through other means, the Fund's\nability to achieve its investment objective will be adversely affected. Under the prevailing PRC\nregulations, eligible foreign institutional investors who wish to invest directly in CIBM through the CIBM\nDirect Access Program may do so through an onshore settlement agent, who would be responsible for making the\nrelevant filings and account opening with the relevant authorities. The Funds are therefore subject to the\nrisk of default or errors on the part of such agent. QFI Investment Risk: In May 2020. the Renminbi\nQualified Foreign Institutional Investor ( \u201c RQFII \u201d ) and Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor ( \u201c QFII\n\u201d ) regimes were combined resulting in a unified set of rules applicable to all RQFIIs and QFIIs by the\nChinese regulators (collectively referred to as \u201c Qualified Foreign Investor \u201d or \u201c QFI \u201d ) Investment\ncompanies, such as the Funds, are not currently within the types of entities that are eligible for QFI\nlicense. Rather, each Fund may utilize the Adviser's QFI license granted under QFI regulations to invest in\nChina bonds. It is possible that the Adviser's QFI status could be suspended or revoked. Pursuant to PRC and\nQFI regulations, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( \u201c SAFE \u201d ) and the China Securities\nRegulatory Commission ( \u201c CSRC \u201d ) are vested with the power to impose regulatory sanctions if the Adviser,\nin its capacity as QFI, or the PRC custodian violates any provision of the QFI regulations. Any such\nviolations could result in the revocation of the Adviser's QFI license or other regulatory sanctions and may\nadversely affect the ability of a Fund to invest in China bonds. The Adviser is also subject to regulation\nby certain Hong Kong regulatory authorities, including the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.\nRegulatory matters arising from such regulation could also adversely affect the Adviser's QFI license and\nability to provide advisory services, generally. There can be no assurance that the Adviser will continue to\nmaintain its QFI status. In the event the Adviser is unable to maintain its QFI status, it may be necessary\nfor the Fund to limit or suspend creations of Creation Units. In such event it is possible that the trading\nprice of the Fund's Shares on its Exchange will be at a significant premium to the NAV (which may also\nincrease tracking error of the Fund). In extreme circumstances, a Fund may incur significant loss due to\nlimited investment capabilities, or may not be able fully to implement or pursue its investment objectives\nor strategies, due to QFI investment restrictions, illiquidity of the PRC securities markets, and delay or\ndisruption in execution of trades or in settlement of trades. The regulations which regulate investments by\nQFIs in the PRC and the repatriation of capital from QFI investments are relatively new. The application and\ninterpretation of such investment regulations are therefore relatively untested and there is no certainty as\nto how they will be applied as the PRC authorities and regulators have been given wide discretion in\n\n18\n\nsuch investment regulations and there is no precedent or certainty as to how such discretion may be\nexercised now or in the future. Existing QFI regulations may change over time and new QFI regulations may be\npromulgated in the future and no assurance can be given that any such changes will not adversely affect a\nFund or its ability to achieve its investment objective. Bond Connect Risks: The \u201c Mutual Bond Market Access\nbetween Mainland China and Hong Kong \u201d ( \u201c Bond Connect \u201d ) program is a new initiative established by PBOC,\nChina Foreign Exchange Trade System & National Interbank Funding Centre ( \u201c CFETS \u201d ), CCDC, SHCH, and Hong\nKong Exchanges and Clearing Limited ( \u201c HKEx \u201d ) and Central Moneymarkets Unit ( \u201c CMU \u201d ) of the Hong Kong\nMonetary Authority ( \u201c HKMA \u201d ) to facilitate investor's investments between the Mainland China and Hong\nKong bond markets through connection between the Mainland China and Hong Kong financial institutions. Under\nthe prevailing PRC regulations, eligible foreign investors are allowed to invest in the bonds available on\nthe CIBM through the northbound trading of Bond Connect ( \u201c Northbound Trading Link \u201d ). There is currently\nno investment quota for the Northbound Trading Link. The Northbound Trading Link refers to the trading\nplatform that is located outside of Mainland China and is connected to CFETS for eligible foreign investors\nto submit their trade requests for bonds circulated in the CIBM through Bond Connect. HKEx and CFETS work\ntogether with offshore electronic bond trading platforms to provide electronic trading services and\nplatforms to allow direct trading between eligible foreign investors and approved onshore dealers in\nMainland China through CFETS. Under the Northbound Trading Link, eligible foreign investors are required to\nappoint the CFETS or other institutions recognized by the PBOC as registration agents to apply for\nregistration with the PBOC. Pursuant to the prevailing regulations in Mainland China, the CMU, the offshore\ncustody agent recognized by the HKMA, opens omnibus nominee accounts with the onshore custody agent\nrecognized by the PBOC (i.e., the CCDC and SHCH). All bonds traded by eligible foreign investors will be\nregistered in the name of the CMU, which will hold such bonds as a nominee owner. Bond Connect is relatively\nnew. Laws, rules, regulations, policies, notices, circulars or guidelines relating to Bond Connect as\npublished or applied by any of the Bond Connect Authorities (as defined below) are relatively untested and\nare subject to change. \u201c Bond Connect Authorities \u201d refers to the exchanges, trading systems, settlement\nsystems, governmental, regulatory or tax bodies which provide services and/or regulate Bond Connect and\nactivities relating to Bond Connect, including, without limitation, the PBOC, the HKMA, the HKEx, the CFETS,\nthe CMU, the CCDC and the SHCH and any other regulator, agency or authority with jurisdiction, authority or\nresponsibility in respect of Bond Connect. There can be no assurance that Bond Connect will not be\nrestricted, suspended or abolished. If such event occurs, a Fund's ability to invest in the CIBM through\nBond Connect may be adversely affected, and if the Fund is unable to adequately access the CIBM through\nother means, the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective may be adversely affected. Under the\nprevailing Bond Connect regulations, eligible foreign investors who wish to participate in Bond Connect may\ndo so through an offshore custody agent, registration agent or other third parties (as the case may be), who\nwould be responsible for making the relevant filings and account opening with the relevant authorities. A\nFund is therefore subject to the risk of default or errors on the part of such agents. Trading through Bond\nConnect is performed through newly developed trading platforms and operational systems. There is no\nassurance that such systems will function properly (in particular, under extreme market conditions) or will\ncontinue to be adapted to changes and developments in the market. In the event that the relevant systems\nfail to function properly, trading through Bond Connect may be disrupted. A Fund's ability to trade through\nBond Connect (and hence to pursue its investment strategy) may therefore be adversely affected. In addition,\nwhere a Fund invests in the CIBM through Bond Connect, it may be subject to risks of delays inherent in the\norder placing and/or settlement. The CMU is the \u201c nominee holder \u201d of the bonds acquired by a Fund through\nBond Connect. While Bond Connect Authorities have expressly stated that investors will enjoy the rights and\ninterests of the bonds acquired through Bond Connect similar to investors in bond interests acquired through\nmore traditional means in accordance with applicable laws, the exercise and the enforcement of beneficial\nownership rights in such bonds in the Chinese courts has yet to be tested. As a result, for example, though\nthe HKMA has stated otherwise in its Frequently Asked Questions relating to Bond Connect, it is possible\nthat in the event that the nominee holder becomes insolvent, such bonds may be deemed to form part of the\npool of assets of the nominee holder available for distribution to its creditors thereby subjugating the\nrights of a Fund.\n\n19\n\nChinese Credit Rating Risks: China bonds will generally be rated by Chinese ratings agencies (and not by\nU.S. nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations ( \u201c NRSROs \u201d )). The rating criteria and\nmethodology used by Chinese rating agencies may be different from those adopted by NRSROs and international\ncredit rating agencies. Therefore, such rating systems may not provide an equivalent standard for comparison\nwith securities rated by NRSROs and international credit rating agencies. Market Risks: A Fund investing in\nthe CIBM will be subject to liquidity and volatility risks. Market volatility and potential lack of\nliquidity due to possible low trading volume of certain bonds in the CIBM may result in prices of certain\nbonds traded in the CIBM fluctuating significantly. The bid and offer spreads of the prices of such bonds\nmay be large, and a Fund may therefore incur significant trading and realization costs and may even suffer\nlosses when selling such investments. To the extent that a Fund transacts in the CIBM, the Fund may also be\nexposed to risks associated with settlement procedures and default of counterparties. The counterparty which\nhas entered into a transaction with a Fund may default in its obligation to settle the transaction by\nfailure to deliver relevant securities or to make payment. General PRC-Related Risks Economic, Political and\nSocial Risks of the PRC: The economy of China, which has been in a state of transition from a planned\neconomy to a more market-oriented economy, differs from the economies of most developed countries in many\nrespects, including the level of government involvement, its state of development, its growth rate, control\nof foreign exchange, protection of intellectual property rights and allocation of resources. Although the\nmajority of productive assets in China are still owned by the PRC government at various levels, in recent\nyears, the PRC government has implemented economic reform measures emphasizing utilization of market forces\nin the development of the economy of China and a high level of management autonomy. The economy of China has\nexperienced significant growth in the past several decades, but growth has been uneven both geographically\nand among various sectors of the economy, and no assurance can be given that such growth will continue.\nEconomic growth has also been accompanied by periods of high inflation. The PRC government has implemented\nvarious measures from time to time to control inflation and restrain the rate of economic growth. There can,\nhowever, be no assurance that the PRC government will continue to pursue such economic policies or, if it\ndoes, that those policies will continue to be successful. Any such adjustment and modification of those\neconomic policies may have an adverse impact on the securities markets in the PRC as well as the portfolio\nsecurities of a Fund. Further, the PRC government may from time to time adopt corrective measures to control\nthe growth of the PRC economy, which may also have an adverse impact on the capital growth and performance\nof a Fund. Political changes, social instability and adverse diplomatic developments in the PRC could result\nin the imposition of additional government restrictions, including expropriation of assets, confiscatory\ntaxes, limits on repatriation, or nationalization of some or all of the property held by the underlying\nissuers of a Fund's portfolio securities. PRC Laws and Regulations Risk: The regulatory and legal framework\nfor capital markets and companies in the PRC may not be as well developed as those of developed countries.\nPRC laws and regulations affecting securities markets are relatively new and evolving, and because of the\nlimited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their non-binding nature, interpretation\nand enforcement of these regulations involve significant uncertainties. In addition, as the PRC legal system\ndevelops, no assurance can be given that changes in such laws and regulations or new laws, regulations or\npractices relating to transactions in Chinese securities will be promulgated, or that their interpretation\nor enforcement will not have a material adverse effect on a Fund's portfolio securities. In addition, the\neffect of future developments in the PRC legal system is unpredictable, such as changes to the existing\nregulatory environment and government scrutiny in certain areas, uncertain interpretation and implementation\nof existing laws or enforcement thereof, or the preemption of local regulations by national laws. For\ninstance, China has tightened regulatory requirements with respect to privacy, data protection and\ninformation security, and has promulgated new regulations and policy to regulate certain industries in the\npast year, which may in turn impact the business operation of the underlying issuers of a Fund's portfolio\nsecurities. The rapid evolving legal system of China may have a material adverse effect on a Fund's\nportfolio securities. PRC Tax Risk: Uncertainties in PRC tax rules governing taxation of income and gains\nfrom investments in China bonds could result in unexpected tax liabilities for a Fund. A Fund's investments\nin China bonds may cause the Fund to become subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by the PRC. The\nMinistry of Finance of the PRC and the State Administration of Taxation of the PRC issued Caishui No. 108 on\nNovember 7, 2018, which states that bond interests derived from investment in the China bond market\n(including through CIBM, a QFI license or Bond Connect) by foreign investors will be temporarily exempt from\nwithholding income tax and value added tax. According to the Announcement on\n\n20\n\nContinuation of Corporate Income Tax and Value-added Tax Policies for Overseas Institutions Investing in the\nDomestic Bond Market (Announcement [2021] No. 34), which was jointly made by the Ministry of Finance and the\nState Administration of Taxation on November 22, 2021, the temporary exemption applies to the withholding\ntax and value-added tax on bond interest derived from investment in the China bond market by foreign\ninstitutional investors and will continue until December 31, 2025. If, in the future, China begins applying\ntax rules regarding the taxation of investment in China bonds by foreign investors, and/or begins collecting\nwithholding and other taxes on interest derived by such investment, a Fund's return might be adversely\naffected. Political Tension Risk: Recently there have been heightened tensions in international economic\nrelations and rising political tensions. In particular, political tensions between the United States and\nChina have escalated due to a series of trade, international treaty, tax, and sanctions actions taken by the\nUnited States against China, among other things, imposition of tariffs on a substantial quantity of Chinese\nimports; the imposition of sanctions on an expanded number of Chinese companies for their support of China's\nmilitary industrial complex or alleged human rights violations; enhanced reviews by CFIUS of foreign direct\ninvestments in the United States by Chinese companies; the detention by US Customs and Border Protection of\nproducts made in Xinjiang involving alleged human rights violations; and the enhancement of extensive export\ncontrols on the semiconductor industry, as well as countersanctions or countermeasures from the PRC\ngovernment that have been triggered or expected to be triggered. Rising political tensions could reduce\nlevels of trade, investments and other economic activities between the two major economies, and any\nescalation thereof may have a negative impact on the general, economic, political, and social conditions in\nChina and, in turn, adversely impact a Fund's portfolio securities. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK An investment\nin a Fund may be subject to a number of actual or potential conflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser\nor its affiliates may provide services to a Fund, such as securities lending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for which the Fund would compensate the Adviser and/or such\naffiliates. A Fund may invest in other pooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise\naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no assurance that the rates at which a Fund pays fees or expenses to\nthe Adviser or its affiliates, or the terms on which it enters into transactions with the Adviser or its\naffiliates, will be the most favorable available in the market generally or as favorable as the rates the\nAdviser makes available to other clients. Because of its financial interest, the Adviser may have an\nincentive to enter into transactions or arrangements on behalf of a Fund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so in the absence of that interest. CONTINUOUS OFFERING The\nmethod by which Creation Units of Shares are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable\nsecurities laws. Because new Creation Units of Shares are issued and sold by the Trust on an ongoing basis,\nat any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as such term is used in the Securities Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result\nin their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them statutory\nunderwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act. For\nexample, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units\nafter placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent Shares, and sells such Shares\ndirectly to customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new Shares with an active\nselling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for Shares. A determination of whether one\nis an underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act must take into account all the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the examples\nmentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a\ncategorization as an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions in Shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of\nShares, are generally required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in\nSection 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus-delivery obligation with respect to Shares of a\n\n21\n\nFund are reminded that under Securities Act Rule 153, a prospectus-delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2)\nof the Securities Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Exchange is satisfied by\nthe fact that a Fund's Prospectus is available at the Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery\nmechanism provided in Rule 153 is only available with respect to transactions on an exchange. SSGA or its\naffiliates (the \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d ) may purchase Creation Units through a broker-dealer to \u201c seed \u201d\n(in whole or in part) Funds as they are launched, or may purchase shares from broker-dealers or other\ninvestors that have previously provided \u201c seed \u201d for a Fund when it was launched or otherwise in secondary\nmarket transactions, and because the Selling Shareholder may be deemed an affiliate of such Funds, the\nShares are being registered to permit the resale of these shares from time to time after purchase. The Funds\nwill not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these Shares. The\nSelling Shareholder intends to sell all or a portion of the Shares owned by it and offered hereby from time\nto time directly or through one or more broker-dealers, and may also hedge such positions. The Shares may be\nsold on any national securities exchange on which the Shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, in\nthe over-the-counter market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at\nprevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at\nnegotiated prices. These sales may be effected in transactions, which may involve cross or block\ntransactions. The Selling Shareholder may also loan or pledge Shares to broker-dealers that in turn may sell\nsuch Shares, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The Selling Shareholder may also enter into options\nor other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more\nderivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of\nShares, which Shares such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell. The Selling Shareholder\nand any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of Shares may be deemed to be \u201c\nunderwriters \u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act in connection with such sales.\nIn such event, any commissions paid to any such broker-dealer or agent and any profit on the resale of the\nShares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.\nThe Selling Shareholder who may be deemed an \u201c underwriter \u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the\nSecurities Act will be subject to the applicable prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act.\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK Counterparty risk with respect to derivatives has been and may continue to be affected by\nnew rules and regulations affecting the derivatives market. Some derivatives transactions are required to be\ncentrally cleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives transaction is subject to the credit risk of the\nclearing house and the clearing member through which it holds its cleared position, rather than the credit\nrisk of its original counterparty to the derivatives transaction. Credit risk of market participants with\nrespect to derivatives that are centrally cleared is concentrated in a few clearing houses, and it is not\nclear how an insolvency proceeding of a clearing house would be conducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by a Fund, and what impact an insolvency of a clearing house would\nhave on the financial system more generally. FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS There can be no assurance that\na liquid secondary market will exist for any particular futures contract or option at any specific time.\nThus, it may not be possible to close a futures or options position. In the event of adverse price\nmovements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin.\nIn such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily\nmargin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be required\nto make delivery of the instruments underlying futures contracts it has sold. Each Fund will minimize the\nrisk that it will be unable to close out a futures or options contract by only entering into futures and\noptions for which there appears to be a liquid secondary market. The risk of loss in trading futures\ncontracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (e.g., selling uncovered index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts, when available, in this\nmanner. The risk of a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin\ndeposits\n\n22\n\nrequired. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor relative to the size of a required margin deposit. A Fund, however,\nmay utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed to limit its risk exposure to that which is\ncomparable to what it would have incurred through direct investment in securities. Utilization of futures\ntransactions by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its benchmark Index if\nthe index underlying the futures contracts differs from the benchmark Index or if the futures contracts do\nnot track the benchmark Index as expected. There is also the risk of loss by a Fund of margin deposits in\nthe event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option.\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices\nduring a single trading day. The \u201c daily price fluctuation limit \u201d or \u201c daily limit \u201d establishes the\nmaximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day's\nsettlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type\nof contract, generally no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. The daily limit\ngoverns only price movement during a particular trading day and therefore does not limit potential losses,\nbecause the limit may prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions. Futures contract prices have\noccasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading,\nthereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting some futures traders to\nsubstantial losses. RISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap\ncounterparty will default on its obligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual\nremedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction, but such remedies may be subject to\nbankruptcy and insolvency laws which could affect the Fund's rights as a creditor. The use of interest-rate\nand index swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different\nfrom those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. The use of a swap requires an\nunderstanding not only of the referenced asset, reference rate, or index, but also of the swap itself,\nwithout the benefit of observing the performance of the swap under all possible market conditions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets or principal.\nThe absence of a regulated execution facility or contract market and lack of liquidity for swap transactions\nhas led, in some instances, to difficulties in trading and valuation, especially in the event of market\ndisruptions. Under recently adopted rules and regulations, transactions in some types of swaps are required\nto be centrally cleared. In a cleared derivatives transaction, a Fund's counterparty to the transaction is a\ncentral derivatives clearing organization, or clearing house, rather than a bank or broker. Because the\nFunds are not members of a clearing house, and only members of a clearing house can participate directly in\nthe clearing house, each Fund holds cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. In cleared\nderivatives transactions, a Fund will make payments (including margin payments) to and receive payments from\na clearing house through its accounts at clearing members. Clearing members guarantee performance of their\nclients' obligations to the clearing house. Centrally cleared derivative arrangements may be less favorable\nto a Fund than bilateral (non-cleared) arrangements. For example, a Fund may be required to provide greater\namounts of margin for cleared derivatives transactions than for bilateral derivatives transactions. Also, in\ncontrast to bilateral derivatives transactions, in some cases following a period of notice to a Fund, a\nclearing member generally can require termination of existing cleared derivatives transactions at any time\nor an increase in margin requirements above the margin that the clearing member required at the beginning of\na transaction. Clearing houses also have broad rights to increase margin requirements for existing\ntransactions or to terminate transactions at any time in accordance with their rules. A Fund is subject to\nrisk if it enters into a derivatives transaction that is required to be cleared (or which SSGA FM expects to\nbe cleared), and no clearing member is willing or able to clear the transaction on the Fund's behalf. In\nthat case, the transaction might have to be terminated, and the Fund could lose some or all of the benefit\nof the transaction, including loss of an increase in the value of the transaction and loss of hedging\nprotection. In addition, the documentation governing the relationship between a Fund and clearing members is\ndrafted by the clearing members and generally is less favorable to the Fund than typical bilateral\nderivatives documentation. These clearing rules and other new rules and regulations could, among other\nthings, restrict a Fund's ability to engage in, or increase the cost to the Fund of, derivatives\ntransactions, for example, by making some types of derivatives no longer available to the Fund, increasing\nmargin or capital requirements, or otherwise limiting liquidity or increasing transaction costs. These\nregulations, as applicable to swaps, are relatively new and evolving, so their potential impact on a Fund\nand the financial system are not yet known.\n\n23\n\nBecause they are two party contracts that may be subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and\ntermination and because they may have terms of greater than seven days, swap agreements may be considered to\nbe illiquid and subject to a Fund's limitation on investments in illiquid investments. To the extent that a\nswap is not liquid, it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses. Like most other investments, swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the market value of the instrument will change in a way detrimental\nto a Fund's interest. If a Fund uses a swap as a hedge against, or as a substitute for, a portfolio\ninvestment, the Fund will be exposed to the risk that the swap will have or will develop imperfect or no\ncorrelation with the portfolio investment. This could cause substantial losses for the Fund. While hedging\nstrategies involving swap instruments can reduce the risk of loss, they can also reduce the opportunity for\ngain or even result in losses by offsetting favorable price movements in other Fund investments. Many swaps\nare complex and often valued subjectively. EUROPE \u2013 RECENT EVENTS A number of countries in Europe, including\nGreece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal, have substantial government debt levels. The concern over these\ndebt levels has led to volatility in the European financial markets, which has adversely affected the\nexchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect every country in Europe. For some\ncountries, the ability to repay sovereign debt is in question, and default is possible, which could affect\ntheir ability to borrow in the future. Several countries have agreed to multi-year bailout loans from the\nEuropean Central Bank, the IMF, and other institutions. A default or debt restructuring by any European\ncountry can adversely impact holders of that country's debt and can affect exposures to other European Union\n( \u201c EU \u201d ) countries and their financial companies as well. These financial difficulties may continue,\nworsen or spread within or outside Europe. Responses to the financial problems by European governments,\ncentral banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not work, may result in social\nunrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences.\nUncertainties regarding the viability of the EU have impacted and may continue to impact markets in the\nUnited States and around the world. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom ( \u201c UK \u201d ) formally withdrew\nfrom the European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d ) (commonly known as \u201c Brexit \u201d ). An agreement between the UK and the EU\ngoverning their future trade relationship became effective January 1, 2021, but that agreement does not\ninclude an agreement on financial services, and it is unlikely that such agreement will be concluded.\nMoreover, the UK government has started a program of financial services law reform with the ultimate aim of\nrepealing many EU financial services laws that were assimilated into UK law from January 1, 2021, and\nreplacing them with legislation or rules made by the UK government or financial services regulators.\nAccordingly, uncertainty remains in certain areas as to the future relationship between the UK and the EU.\nBrexit has already had a significant impact on the UK, Europe, and global economies, and could continue to\nresult in volatility and illiquidity, legal, political, economic and regulatory uncertainties and lower\neconomic growth for these economies that could in turn have an adverse effect on the value of a Fund's\ninvestments. Any further exits from the EU, or the possibility of such exits, or the abandonment of the\neuro, may cause additional market disruption globally and introduce new legal and regulatory uncertainties.\nMARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING FROM INFECTIOUS ILLNESS A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as\nCOVID-19, may lead to governments and businesses world-wide taking aggressive measures, including closing\nborders, restricting international and domestic travel, and the imposition of prolonged quarantines of large\npopulations. As occurred in the wake of COVID-19, the spread of such an illness may result in the disruption\nof and delays in the delivery of healthcare services and processes, the cancellation of organized events and\neducational institutions, the disruption of production and supply chains, a decline in consumer demand for\ncertain goods and services, and general concern and uncertainty, all of which may contribute to increased\nvolatility in global markets. COVID-19, and other epidemics and pandemics that may arise in the future,\ncould adversely affect the economies of many nations, the global economy, individual companies, sectors and\nindustries, and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen at the present time. In addition, the impact\nof infectious diseases in developing or emerging market countries may be greater due to limited health care\nresources. Political, economic and social stresses caused by infectious illness also may exacerbate other\npre-existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries. The duration of such an illness and\nits effects cannot be determined at this time, but the effects could be present for an extended period of\ntime.\n\n24\n\nRUSSIA SANCTIONS RISK Sanctions threatened or imposed by a number of jurisdictions, including the United\nStates, the European Union and the United Kingdom, and other intergovernmental actions that have been or may\nbe undertaken in the future, against Russia, Russian entities or Russian individuals, may result in the\ndevaluation of Russian currency, a downgrade in the country's credit rating, an immediate freeze of Russian\nassets, a decline in the value and liquidity of Russian securities, property or interests, and/or other\nadverse consequences to the Russian economy or a Fund. The scope and scale of sanctions in place at a\nparticular time may be expanded or otherwise modified in a way that have negative effects on a Fund.\nSanctions, or the threat of new or modified sanctions, could impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell,\nhold, receive, deliver or otherwise transact in certain affected securities or other investment instruments.\nSanctions could also result in Russia taking counter measures or other actions in response, which may\nfurther impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities. These sanctions, and the resulting disruption\nof the Russian economy, may cause volatility in other regional and global markets and may negatively impact\nthe performance of various sectors and industries, as well as companies in other countries, which could have\na negative effect on the performance of a Fund, even if a Fund does not have direct exposure to securities\nof Russian issuers. As a collective result of the imposition of sanctions, Russian government\ncountermeasures and the impact that they have had on the trading markets for Russian securities, certain\nFunds have used, and may in the future use, fair valuation procedures approved by the Fund's Board to value\ncertain Russian securities, which could result in such securities being deemed to have a zero value. A\nreduction in liquidity of certain Fund holdings as a result of sanctions and related actions may cause a\nFund to experience increased premiums or discounts to its NAV and/or wider bid-ask spreads. Additionally, if\nit becomes impracticable or unlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by,\nsanctions, or if deemed appropriate by the Fund's investment adviser, the Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits\nof the affected securities in connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit,\nwhich may also increase the Fund's transaction costs. TAX RISKS As with any investment, you should consider\nhow your investment in Shares of a Fund will be taxed. The tax information in the Prospectus and this SAI is\nprovided as general information. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of\nan investment in Shares of a Fund. Unless your investment in Shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or\ntax-advantaged retirement account, such as an individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the\npossible tax consequences when a Fund makes distributions or you sell Shares. Investment Restrictions The\nTrust has adopted the following investment restrictions as fundamental policies with respect to each Fund.\nThese restrictions cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of a Fund's\noutstanding voting securities. For purposes of the 1940 Act, a majority of the outstanding voting securities\nof a Fund means the vote, at an annual or a special meeting of the security holders of the Trust, of the\nlesser of (1) 67% or more of the voting securities of the Fund present at such meeting, if the holders of\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (2)\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Except with the approval of a majority of\nthe outstanding voting securities, each Fund may not: 1. Concentrate its investments in securities of\nissuers in the same industry, except as may be necessary to approximate the composition of the Fund's\nunderlying Index; (1) 2. Make loans to another person except as permitted by the 1940 Act or other governing\nstatute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund; 3.\nIssue senior securities or borrow money except as permitted by the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund; 4. Invest\ndirectly in real estate unless the real estate is acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other\ninstruments. This restriction shall not preclude the Fund from investing in companies that deal in real\nestate or in instruments that are backed or secured by real estate;\n\n(1) The SEC Staff considers concentration to involve more than 25% of a fund's assets to be invested in an\nindustry or group of industries.\n\n25\n\n5. Act as an underwriter of another issuer's securities, except to the extent the Fund may be deemed to be\nan underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with the Fund's purchase and sale of\nportfolio securities; or 6. Invest in commodities except as permitted by the 1940 Act or other governing\nstatute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund. In\naddition to the investment restrictions adopted as fundamental policies as set forth above, each Fund\nobserves the following restrictions, which may be changed by the Board without a shareholder vote. Each Fund\nwill not: 1. Invest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising management or control,\nprovided that the Trust may vote the investment securities owned by the Fund in accordance with its views;\nor 2. With respect to each Fund, under normal circumstances, invest less than 80% of its total assets in\nsecurities that comprise its relevant Index. Securities that have economic characteristics substantially\nidentical to the economic characteristics of the securities that comprise the Index are included within this\n80% investment policy. 3. With respect to the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE\nInternational Government Inflation-Protected Bond ETF, under normal circumstances, invest less than 80% of\nits net assets, plus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in debt securities. Prior to any\nchange in a Fund's 80% investment policy, the Fund will provide shareholders with 60 days written notice. 4.\nWith respect to the SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF, invest, under normal circumstances,\nless than 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in corporate bonds.\nPrior to any change in this 80% investment policy, the Fund will provide shareholders with 60 days written\nnotice. 5. With respect to the SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR Bloomberg Short Term\nInternational Treasury Bond ETF, under normal circumstances, invest less than 80% of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in government bonds. Prior to any change in the Fund's 80%\ninvestment policy, the Fund will provide shareholders with 60 days written notice. The Funds define the\nforegoing terms in accordance with the definition of such terms per the applicable Index. If a percentage\nlimitation is adhered to at the time of investment or contract, a later increase or decrease in percentage\nresulting from any change in value or total or net assets will not result in a violation of such\nrestriction, except that the percentage limitations with respect to the borrowing of money will be observed\ncontinuously. With respect to the limitation on borrowing, in the event that a subsequent change in net\nassets or other circumstances cause a Fund to exceed its limitation, the Fund will take steps to bring the\naggregate amount of borrowing back within the limitations within three days thereafter (not including\nSundays and holidays). The 1940 Act currently permits each Fund to loan up to 33 1/3% of its total assets.\nWith respect to borrowing, the 1940 Act presently allows each Fund to: (1) borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets, (2) borrow\nmoney for temporary purposes in an amount not exceeding 5% of the value of the Fund's total assets at the\ntime of the loan, and (3) enter into reverse repurchase agreements. However, under normal circumstances any\nborrowings by a Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. The 1940 Act generally prohibits funds\nfrom issuing senior securities, although it does not treat certain transactions as senior securities, such\nas certain borrowings, with appropriate asset coverage. With respect to investments in commodities, the 1940\nAct presently permits the Funds to invest in commodities in accordance with investment policies contained in\nits prospectus and SAI. Any such investment shall also comply with the CEA and the rules and regulations\nthereunder. The 1940 Act does not directly restrict an investment company's ability to invest in real\nestate, but does require that every investment company have the fundamental investment policy governing such\ninvestments. The Funds will not purchase or sell real estate, except that a Fund may invest in companies\nthat deal in real estate (including REITs) or in instruments that are backed or secured by real estate.\nExchange Listing and Trading A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an\ninvestment in a Fund is contained in the Prospectus under \u201c PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION \u201d and \u201c ADDITIONAL\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with,\nsuch sections of the Prospectus.\n\n26\n\nThe Shares of each Fund are approved for listing and trading on the Exchange, subject to notice of issuance.\nShares trade on the Exchange at prices that may differ to some degree from their net asset value. There can\nbe no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of Shares of a Fund\nwill continue to be met. The Exchange may consider the suspension of trading in, and may initiate delisting\nproceedings of, the Shares of a Fund under any of the following circumstances: (i) if the Exchange becomes\naware that the Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the 1940 Act; (ii) if\nthe Fund no longer complies with the applicable listing requirements set forth in the Exchange's rules;\n(iii) if, following the initial twelve-month period after commencement of trading on the Exchange of the\nFund, there are fewer than 50 beneficial holders of the Fund; or (iv) if such other event shall occur or\ncondition exists which, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes further dealings on the Exchange inadvisable.\nThe Exchange will remove the Shares from listing and trading upon termination of a Fund. The Trust reserves\nthe right to adjust the Share price of a Fund in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would\nhave no effect on the net assets of the Fund or an investor's equity interest in the Fund. As in the case of\nother publicly traded securities, brokers' commissions on transactions will be based on negotiated\ncommission rates at customary levels. The base and trading currencies of each Fund is the U.S. dollar. The\nbase currency is the currency in which a Fund's net asset value per Share is calculated and the trading\ncurrency is the currency in which Shares of a Fund are listed and traded on the Exchange. Management of the\nTrust The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in the\nProspectus entitled \u201c MANAGEMENT. \u201d BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES The management and affairs of the Trust and its\nseries, including the Funds described in this SAI, are overseen by the Trustees. The Board has approved\ncontracts, as described in this SAI, under which certain companies provide essential management services to\nthe Trust. Like most mutual funds, the day-to-day business of the Trust, including the management of risk,\nis performed by third party service providers, such as the Adviser, Distributor, Administrator, and Sub-\nAdministrator. The Trustees are responsible for overseeing the Trust's service providers and, thus, have\noversight responsibility with respect to risk management performed by those service providers. Risk\nmanagement seeks to identify and address risks, i.e ., events or circumstances that could have material\nadverse effects on the business, operations, shareholder services, investment performance or reputation of\nthe Funds. The Funds and their service providers employ a variety of processes, procedures and controls to\nidentify various of those possible events or circumstances, to lessen the probability of their occurrence\nand/or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur. Each service provider is\nresponsible for one or more discrete aspects of the Trust's business and, consequently, for managing the\nrisks associated with that business. The Board has emphasized to the Funds' service providers the importance\nof maintaining vigorous risk management. The Trustees' role in risk oversight begins before the inception of\na Fund, at which time the Fund's Adviser presents the Board with information concerning the investment\nobjectives, strategies and risks of the Fund, as well as proposed investment limitations for the Fund.\nAdditionally, the Fund's Adviser provides the Board with an overview of, among other things, their\ninvestment philosophies, brokerage practices and compliance infrastructures. Thereafter, the Board continues\nits oversight function as various personnel, including the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer, as well as\npersonnel of the Adviser and other service providers, such as the Fund's independent accountants, make\nperiodic reports to the Audit Committee or to the Board with respect to various aspects of risk management.\nThe Board and the Audit Committee oversee efforts by management and service providers to manage risks to\nwhich a Fund may be exposed. The Board is responsible for overseeing the nature, extent and quality of the\nservices provided to the Funds by the Adviser and receives information about those services at its regular\nmeetings. In addition, on an annual basis, in connection with its consideration of whether to renew the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, the Board\n\n27\n\nmeets with the Adviser to review such services. Among other things, the Board regularly considers the\nAdviser's adherence to each Fund's investment restrictions and compliance with various Fund policies and\nprocedures and with applicable securities regulations. The Board also reviews information about each Fund's\ninvestments. The Trust's Chief Compliance Officer reports regularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance issues. At least annually, the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer provides the Board with a report\nreviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Trust's policies and procedures and those of its service\nproviders, including the Adviser. The report addresses the operation of the policies and procedures of the\nTrust and each service provider since the date of the last report; any material changes to the policies and\nprocedures since the date of the last report; any recommendations for material changes to the policies and\nprocedures; and any material compliance matters since the date of the last report. The Board receives\nreports from the Funds' service providers regarding operational risks and risks related to the valuation and\nliquidity of portfolio securities. Regular reports are made to the Board concerning investments for which\nmarket quotations are not readily available. Annually, the independent registered public accounting firm\nreviews with the Audit Committee its audit of each Fund's financial statements, focusing on major areas of\nrisk encountered by the Fund and noting any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Fund's\ninternal controls. Additionally, in connection with its oversight function, the Board oversees Fund\nmanagement's implementation of disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports with the SEC are recorded,\nprocessed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods. The Board also oversees the Trust's\ninternal controls over financial reporting, which comprise policies and procedures designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Trust's financial reporting and the preparation of the\nTrust's financial statements. From their review of these reports and discussions with the Adviser, the Chief\nCompliance Officer, the independent registered public accounting firm and other service providers, the Board\nand the Audit Committee learn in detail about the material risks of the Funds, thereby facilitating a\ndialogue about how management and service providers identify and mitigate those risks. The Board recognizes\nthat not all risks that may affect a Fund can be identified and/or quantified, that it may not be practical\nor cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks\n(such as investment-related risks) to achieve a Fund's goals, and that the processes, procedures and\ncontrols employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, reports received\nby the Trustees as to risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant information. Most of\nthe Funds' investment management and business affairs are carried out by or through a Fund's Adviser and\nother service providers, each of which has an independent interest in risk management but whose policies and\nthe methods by which one or more risk management functions are carried out may differ from the Funds' and\neach other's in the setting of priorities, the resources available or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Board's ability to monitor and manage risk, as\na practical matter, is subject to limitations. TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS There are eight members of the Board of\nTrustees, seven of whom are not interested persons of the Trust, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act ( \u201c\nIndependent Trustees \u201d ). Carl Verboncoeur, an Independent Trustee, serves as Chairman of the Board. The\nBoard has determined its leadership structure is appropriate given the specific characteristics and\ncircumstances of the Trust. The Board made this determination in consideration of, among other things, the\nfact that the Independent Trustees constitute a super-majority (87.5%) of the Board, the fact that the\nchairperson of each Committee of the Board is an Independent Trustee, the amount of assets under management\nin the Trust, and the number of funds overseen by the Board. The Board also believes that its leadership\nstructure facilitates the orderly and efficient flow of information to the Independent Trustees from fund\nmanagement. The Board of Trustees has two standing committees: the Audit Committee and Trustee Committee.\nThe Audit Committee and Trustee Committee are each chaired by an Independent Trustee and composed of all of\nthe Independent Trustees. Set forth below are the names, year of birth, position with the Trust, length of\nterm of office, and the principal occupations during the last five years and other directorships held of\neach of the persons currently serving as a Trustee or Officer of the Trust.\n\n28\n\nTRUSTEES\n                                                                                                            \n  Name,                              Term ofOffice                                Number  OtherDirectorsh\u2026  \n  Addressand Year  Position(s)With\u2026  andLength ofTime  PrincipalOccupa\u2026   ofPortfoliosin  byTrusteeDuring   \n  of Birth                           Served            PastFive Years    FundComplexOve\u2026  PastFive Years    \n                                                                                Trustee\u2020                    \n                   INDEPENDENT                                                                              \n                   TRUSTEES                                                                                 \n  CARL G.                                                                                                   \n  VERBONCOEURc/o                                                                                            \n  SPDR Series      IndependentTrus\u2026  Term:UnlimitedS\u2026  Self-employedco\u2026              144  None.             \n  TrustOne Iron                      April2010         since 2009.                                          \n  StreetBoston,                                                                                             \n  MA 022101952                                                                                              \n  DWIGHT D.

The portfolio managers listed above\ndid not beneficially own any interests of any Fund as of December 31, 2024. Conflicts of Interest. A\nportfolio manager that has responsibility for managing more than one account may be subject to potential\nconflicts of interest because he or she is responsible for other accounts in addition to the Funds. Those\nconflicts could include preferential treatment of one account over others in terms of: (a) the portfolio\nmanager's execution of different investment strategies for various accounts; or (b) the allocation of\nresources or of investment opportunities. Portfolio managers may manage numerous accounts for multiple\nclients. These accounts may include registered investment companies, other types of pooled accounts (e.g.,\ncollective investment funds), and separate accounts (i.e., accounts managed on behalf of individuals or\npublic or private institutions). Portfolio managers make investment decisions for each account based on the\ninvestment objectives and policies and other relevant investment considerations applicable to that\nportfolio. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of a portfolio manager's responsibility\nfor multiple accounts with similar investment guidelines. Under these circumstances, a potential investment\nmay be suitable for more than one of the portfolio manager's accounts, but the quantity of the investment\navailable for purchase is less than the aggregate amount the accounts would ideally allocate to the\nopportunity. Similar conflicts may arise when multiple\n\n38\n\naccounts seek to dispose of the same investment. The portfolio managers may also manage accounts whose\nobjectives and policies differ from that of the Funds. These differences may be such that under certain\ncircumstances, trading activity appropriate for one account managed by the portfolio manager may have\nadverse consequences for another account managed by the portfolio manager. For example, an account may sell\na significant position in a security, which could cause the market price of that security to decrease, while\na Fund maintained its position in that security. A potential conflict may arise when the portfolio managers\nare responsible for accounts that have different advisory fees\u2014 the difference in fees could create an\nincentive for the portfolio manager to favor one account over another, for example, in terms of access to\ninvestment opportunities. This conflict may be heightened if an account is subject to a performance-based\nfee, as applicable. Another potential conflict may arise when the portfolio manager has a personal\ninvestment in one or more accounts that participate in transactions with other accounts. His or her personal\ninvestment(s) may create an incentive for the portfolio manager to favor one account over another. The\nAdviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to address these potential material\nconflicts. For instance, portfolio managers are normally responsible for all accounts within a certain\ninvestment discipline and do not, absent special circumstances, differentiate among the various accounts\nwhen allocating resources. Additionally, the Adviser and its advisory affiliates have processes and\nprocedures for allocating investment opportunities among portfolios that are designed to provide a fair and\nequitable allocation. With respect to conflicts arising from personal investments, all employees, including\nportfolio managers, must comply with personal trading controls established by each of the Adviser's and\nTrust's Code of Ethics. Compensation. SSGA's culture is complemented and reinforced by a total rewards\nstrategy that is based on a pay for performance philosophy which seeks to offer a competitive pay mix of\nbase salary, benefits, cash incentives and deferred compensation. Salary is based on a number of factors,\nincluding external benchmarking data and market trends, and performance both at the business and individual\nlevel. SSGA's Global Human Resources department regularly participates in compensation surveys in order to\nprovide SSGA with market-based compensation information that helps support individual pay decisions.\nAdditionally, subject to State Street and SSGA business results, an incentive pool is allocated to SSGA to\nreward its employees. The size of the incentive pool for most business units is based on the firm's overall\nprofitability and other factors, including performance against risk-related goals. For most SSGA investment\nteams, SSGA recognizes and rewards performance by linking annual incentive decisions for investment teams to\nthe firm's or business unit's profitability and business unit investment performance over a multi-year\nperiod. Incentive pool funding for most active investment teams is driven in part by the post-tax investment\nperformance of fund(s) managed by the team versus the return levels of the benchmark index(es) of the\nfund(s) on a one-, three- and, in some cases, five-year basis. For most active investment teams, a material\nportion of incentive compensation for senior staff is deferred over a four-year period into the SSGA Long-\nTerm Incentive ( \u201c SSGA LTI \u201d ) program. For these teams, The SSGA LTI program indexes the performance of\nthese deferred awards against the post-tax investment performance of fund(s) managed by the team. This is\nintended to align our investment team's compensation with client interests, both through annual incentive\ncompensation awards and through the long-term value of deferred awards in the SSGA LTI program. For the\nindex equity investment team, incentive pool funding is driven in part by the post-tax 1 and 3-year tracking\nerror of the funds managed by the team against the benchmark indexes of the funds. The discretionary\nallocation of the incentive pool to the business units within SSGA is influenced by market-based\ncompensation data, as well as the overall performance of each business unit. Individual compensation\ndecisions are made by the employee's manager, in conjunction with the senior management of the employee's\nbusiness unit. These decisions are based on the overall performance of the employee and, as mentioned above,\non the performance of the firm and business unit. Depending on the job level, a portion of the annual\nincentive may be awarded in deferred compensation, which may include cash and/or Deferred Stock Awards\n(State Street stock), which typically vest over a four-year period. This helps to retain staff and further\naligns SSGA employees' interests with SSGA clients' and shareholders' long-term interests. SSGA recognizes\nand rewards outstanding performance by: \u2022 Promoting employee ownership to connect employees directly to the\ncompany's success. \u2022 Using rewards to reinforce mission, vision, values and business strategy. \u2022 Seeking to\nrecognize and preserve the firm's unique culture and team orientation. \u2022 Providing all employees the\nopportunity to share in the success of SSGA.\n\n39\n\nTHE ADMINISTRATOR, SUB-ADMINISTRATOR, CUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT Administrator: SSGA FM serves as the\nadministrator to each series of the Trust, pursuant to an Administration Agreement dated June 1, 2015 (the \u201c\nSSGA Administration Agreement \u201d ).

That income, as well as fees and/or compensation paid by these Funds (in dollars) pursuant\nto the Master Amended and Restated Securities Lending Authorization Agreement among SPDR Series Trust, SPDR\nIndex Shares Funds and SSGA Active Trust, each on behalf of its respective series, and State Street (the \u201c\nSecurities Lending Authorization Agreement \u201d ) were as follows:\n                                                                                                            \n                                        Fees                                                                \n                                      and/or                                                                \n                                   compensa\u2026                                                                \n                                     paid by                                         Aggregat\u2026              \n            Grossinc\u2026              the Funds                                             bythe         Net  \n                bythe                    for                                         Fundfors\u2026  incomefro\u2026  \n            Fundfrom\u2026              securiti\u2026                                         relateds\u2026              \n                                     lending                                                                \n                                   activiti\u2026                                                                \n                                   andrelat\u2026                                                                \n                                    services                                                                \n                         Feespaid                                                                           \n                           forany                                                                           \n                       cashcolla\u2026                                                                           \n            Feespaid\u2026     apooled  Admini-s\u2026  Indemnifi\u2026                                                    \n            StateStr\u2026  cashcolla\u2026  notinclu\u2026         ina  Rebate(p\u2026  Otherfees\u2026                             \n            arevenue\u2026         are  arevenue\u2026  revenuesp\u2026  toborrow\u2026  arevenues\u2026                             \n                       notinclud\u2026                                                                           \n                               in                                                                           \n                         arevenue                                                                           \n                            split                                                                           \n  SPDRBlo\u2026                                                                                                  \n  LocalBo\u2026   $122,611      $3,627       $667          $0         $0     $97,759  $0   $102,053     $20,558  \n  ETF                                                                                                       \n  SPDRBlo\u2026     $4,450        $151         $0          $0         $0      $3,447  $0     $3,598        $852  \n  ETF                                                                                                       \n  SPDRBlo\u2026         $0          $0         $0          $0         $0          $0  $0         $0          $0  \n  BondETF                                                                                                   \n  SPDRBlo\u2026                                                                                                  \n  TermInt\u2026         $0          $0         $0          $0         $0          $0  $0         $0          $0  \n  BondETF                                                                                                   \n  SPDR                                                                                                      \n  FTSEInt\u2026         $0          $0         $0          $0         $0          $0  $0         $0          $0  \n  otected\u2026                                                                                                  \n  ETF                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, State Street, acting as agent of the Funds, provided the\nfollowing services to the Funds in connection with the Funds' securities lending activities: (i) locating\nborrowers among an approved list of prospective borrowers; (ii) causing the delivery of loaned securities\nfrom a Fund to borrowers; (iii) monitoring the value of loaned securities, the value of collateral received,\nand other lending parameters; (iv) seeking additional collateral, as necessary, from borrowers; (v)\nreceiving and holding collateral from borrowers, and facilitating the investment and reinvestment of all or\nsubstantially all cash collateral in an investment vehicle designated by the Funds; (vi) returning\ncollateral to borrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute dividend, interest, and other distribution payments\nto the Funds from borrowers; (viii) negotiating the terms of each loan of securities, including but not\nlimited to the amount of any loan premium, and monitoring the terms of securities loan agreements with\nprospective borrowers for consistency with the requirements of the Funds' Securities Lending Authorization\nAgreement; (ix) selecting securities, including amounts (percentages), to be loaned; (x) recordkeeping and\naccounting services; and (xi) arranging for return of loaned securities to a Fund in accordance with the\nterms of the Securities Lending Authorization Agreement.\n\n41\n\nTHE DISTRIBUTOR State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC serves as the principal underwriter and\nDistributor of Shares. Its principal address is One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. Investor\ninformation can be obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257. The Distributor has entered into a distribution\nagreement ( \u201c Distribution Agreement \u201d ) with the Trust pursuant to which it distributes Shares of each\nFund. The Distribution Agreement will continue for two years from its effective date and is renewable\nannually thereafter. Shares will be continuously offered for sale by the Trust through the Distributor only\nin Creation Units, as described in the Prospectus and below under \u201c PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION\nUNITS. \u201d Shares in less than Creation Units are not distributed by the Distributor. The Distributor will\ndeliver the Prospectus to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both orders placed\nwith it and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it. The Distributor is a broker-dealer registered under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201c Exchange Act \u201d ) and a member of the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority ( \u201c FINRA \u201d ). The Distributor has no role in determining the investment\npolicies of the Trust or which securities are to be purchased or sold by the Trust. An affiliate of the\nDistributor may assist Authorized Participants (as defined below) in assembling shares to purchase Creation\nUnits or upon redemption, for which it may receive commissions or other fees from such Authorized\nParticipants. An affiliate of the Distributor also receives compensation from State Street for providing on-\nline creation and redemption functionality to Authorized Participants through its Fund Connect application.\nThe Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or Distributor, may directly or indirectly make\ncash payments to certain broker-dealers for participating in activities that are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives and other professionals more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the\nSPDR funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems.\nIn addition, as of the date of this SAI, the Adviser and/or Distributor had arrangements whereby they may\nmake payments, other than for the educational programs and marketing activities described above, to Pershing\nLLC ( \u201c Pershing \u201d ), RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( \u201c RBC \u201d ), LPL Financial, LLC ( \u201c LPL \u201d ), and Morgan\nStanley Wealth Management, LLC. These amounts, which may be significant, are paid by the Adviser and/or\nDistributor from their own resources and not from Fund assets. Pursuant to these arrangements, Pershing, RBC\nand LPL have agreed to offer certain SPDR funds to their customers and not to charge certain of their\ncustomers any commissions when those customers purchase or sell shares of certain SPDR funds. Payments to a\nbroker-dealer or intermediary may create potential conflicts of interest between the broker dealer or\nintermediary and its clients. In addition, the Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or\nDistributor, as well as an index provider that is not affiliated with the Adviser or Distributor, may\nreimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to other persons in consideration of services,\nprovision of data, or other activities that they believe may benefit the SPDR business or facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds. The Distribution Agreement provides that it may be terminated at any time, without\nthe payment of any penalty, as to a Fund: (i) by vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees or (ii) by\nvote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, on at\nleast 60 days' written notice to the Distributor. The Distribution Agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays' notice by the Distributor and will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined\nin the 1940 Act). The continuation of the Distribution Agreement and any other related agreements is subject\nto annual approval of the Board, including by a majority of the Independent Trustees, as described above.\nThe allocation among the Trust's series of fees and expenses payable under the Distribution Agreement will\nbe made pro rata in accordance with the daily net assets of the respective series. The Distributor may also\nenter into agreements with securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers \u201d ) who will solicit purchases of\nCreation Unit aggregations of Shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Participating Parties (as defined\nin the \u201c Book Entry Only System \u201d section below) and/or DTC Participants (as defined below). Pursuant to the\nDistribution Agreement, the Trust has agreed to indemnify the Distributor, and may indemnify Soliciting\nDealers and Authorized Participants (as described below) entering into agreements with the Distributor, for\ncertain liabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the federal securities laws, unless such\nloss or liability results from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Distribution Agreement or other\nagreement, as applicable.\n\n42\n\nBrokerage Transactions All portfolio transactions are placed on behalf of the Funds by the Adviser.\nPurchases and sales of securities on a securities exchange are affected through brokers who charge a\ncommission for their services. Ordinarily commissions are not charged on over-the-counter orders (e.g.,\nfixed income securities) because the Funds pay a spread which is included in the cost of the security and\nrepresents the difference between the dealer's quoted price at which it is willing to sell the security and\nthe dealer's quoted price at which it is willing to buy the security. When a Fund executes an over-the-\ncounter order with an electronic communications network or an alternative trading system, a commission is\ncharged by such electronic communications networks and alternative trading systems as they execute such\norders on an agency basis. Securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting\nfees. In placing a portfolio transaction, the Adviser seeks to achieve best execution. The Adviser's duty to\nseek best execution requires the Adviser to take reasonable steps to obtain for the client as favorable an\noverall result as possible for Fund portfolio transactions under the circumstances, taking into account\nvarious factors that are relevant to the particular transaction. The Adviser refers to and selects from the\nlist of approved trading counterparties maintained by the Adviser's Credit Risk Management team. In\nselecting a trading counterparty for a particular trade, the Adviser seeks to weigh relevant factors\nincluding, but not limited to the following: \u2022 Prompt and reliable execution; \u2022 The competitiveness of\ncommission rates and spreads, if applicable; \u2022 The financial strength, stability and/or reputation of the\ntrading counterparty; \u2022 The willingness and ability of the executing trading counterparty to execute\ntransactions (and commit capital) of size in liquid and illiquid markets without disrupting the market for\nthe security; \u2022 Local laws, regulations or restrictions; \u2022 The ability of the trading counterparty to\nmaintain confidentiality; \u2022 The availability and capability of execution venues, including electronic\ncommunications networks for trading and execution management systems made available to Adviser; \u2022 Market\nshare; \u2022 Liquidity; \u2022 Price; \u2022 Execution related costs; \u2022 History of execution of orders; \u2022 Likelihood of\nexecution and settlement; \u2022 Order size and nature; \u2022 Clearance and settlement capabilities, especially in\nhigh volatility market environments; \u2022 Availability of lendable securities; \u2022 Sophistication of the trading\ncounterparty's trading capabilities and infrastructure/facilities; \u2022 The operational efficiency with which\ntransactions are processed and cleared, taking into account the order size and complexity; \u2022 Speed and\nresponsiveness to the Adviser; \u2022 Access to secondary markets; \u2022 Counterparty exposure; and \u2022 Depending upon\nthe circumstances, the Adviser may take other relevant factors into account if the Adviser believes that\nthese are important in taking all sufficient steps to obtain the best possible result for execution of the\norder. In selecting a trading counterparty, the price of the transaction and costs related to the execution\nof the transaction typically merit a high relative importance, depending on the circumstances. The Adviser\ndoes not necessarily select a trading counterparty based upon price and costs but may take other relevant\nfactors into account if it believes that these are important in taking reasonable steps to obtain the best\npossible result for a Fund under the circumstances.\n\n43\n\nConsequently, the Adviser may cause a client to pay a trading counterparty more than another trading\ncounterparty might have charged for the same transaction in recognition of the value and quality of the\nbrokerage services provided. The following matters may influence the relative importance that the Adviser\nplaces upon the relevant factors: (i) The nature and characteristics of the order or transaction. For\nexample, size of order, market impact of order, limits, or other instructions relating to the order; (ii)\nThe characteristics of the financial instrument(s) or other assets which are the subject of that order. For\nexample, whether the order pertains to an equity, fixed income, derivative or convertible instrument; (iii)\nThe characteristics of the execution venues to which that order can be directed, if relevant. For example,\navailability and capabilities of electronic trading systems; (iv) Whether the transaction is a \u2018delivery\nversus payment' or \u2018over-the-counter' transaction. The creditworthiness of the trading counterparty, the\namount of existing exposure to a trading counterparty and trading counterparty settlement capabilities may\nbe given a higher relative importance in the case of \u2018over-the-counter' transactions; and/or (v) Any other\ncircumstances that the Adviser believes are relevant at the time. The process by which trading\ncounterparties are selected to effect transactions is designed to exclude consideration of the sales efforts\nconducted by broker-dealers in relation to the Funds. The Adviser does not currently use the Funds' assets\nin connection with third-party soft dollar arrangements. While the Adviser does not currently use \u201c soft \u201d\nor commission dollars paid by the Funds for the purchase of third-party research, the Adviser reserves the\nright to do so in the future. The Funds did not pay any brokerage commissions for the past three fiscal\nyears. Securities of \u201c Regular Broker-Dealers \u201d : Each Fund is required to identify any securities of its \u201c\nregular brokers and dealers \u201d (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act) which it may hold at the close of\nits most recent fiscal year. \u201c Regular brokers or dealers \u201d of the Trust are the ten brokers or dealers\nthat, during the most recent fiscal year: (i) received the greatest dollar amounts of brokerage commissions\nfrom the Trust's portfolio transactions; (ii) engaged as principal in the largest dollar amounts of\nportfolio transactions of the Trust; or (iii) sold the largest dollar amounts of the Trust's shares. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, the Funds did not have any holdings in securities of Regular Broker-Dealers. Portfolio\nTurnover: Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as within a year. The Funds may experience\nhigher portfolio turnover when migrating to a different benchmark index. High turnover rates are likely to\nresult in comparatively greater brokerage expenses or transaction costs. The overall reasonableness of\nbrokerage commissions and transaction costs is evaluated by the Adviser based upon its knowledge of\navailable information as to the general level of commissions and transaction costs paid by other\ninstitutional investors for comparable services. Book Entry Only System The following information\nsupplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c ADDITIONAL\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d The Depository Trust Company ( \u201c DTC \u201d ) acts as securities depositary for\nthe Shares. Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee,\nCede & Co., and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. Except in the limited circumstance provided below,\ncertificates will not be issued for Shares. DTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was created to hold\nsecurities of its participants (the \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of\nsecurities transactions among the DTC Participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes\nin accounts of the DTC Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities\ncertificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC. More\nspecifically, DTC is owned by a number of its DTC Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d\n) and FINRA. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust\ncompanies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or\nindirectly (the \u201c Indirect Participants \u201d ).\n\n44\n\nBeneficial ownership of Shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in Shares\n(owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as \u201c Beneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants)\nand on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are\nnot DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written\nconfirmation relating to their purchase of Shares. Conveyance of all notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the\nTrust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee to be charged to\nthe Trust a listing of the Shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust, either directly or\nthrough a third party service, shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial\nOwners holding Shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust, either directly or\nthrough a third party service, shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement\nor other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably\nrequest, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,\ndirectly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC\nParticipant and/or third party service a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses\nattendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Share\ndistributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the registered holder of all Shares. DTC\nor its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants' accounts\nwith payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in Shares of a Fund as shown\non the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial\nOwners of Shares held through such DTC Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary\npractices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or\nregistered in a \u201c street name, \u201d and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants. The Trust has no\nresponsibility or liability for any aspects of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or\npayments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such Shares, or for maintaining, supervising\nor reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the\nrelationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may determine to\ndiscontinue providing its service with respect to Shares at any time by giving reasonable notice to the\nTrust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action either to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at\na comparable cost or, if such a replacement is unavailable, to issue and deliver printed certificates\nrepresenting ownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes other arrangements with respect thereto\nsatisfactory to the Exchange.

Purchase and Redemption of Creation Units Each Fund issues and redeems its Shares on a\ncontinuous basis, at net asset value, only in a large specified number of Shares called a \u201c Creation Unit. \u201d\nThe value of each Fund is determined once each business day as described under \u201c Determination of Net Asset\nValue. \u201d The Creation Unit size for a Fund may change. Authorized Participants (as defined below) will be\nnotified of such change. The principal consideration for creations and redemptions for each Fund is in-kind,\nalthough this may be revised at any time without notice. PURCHASE (CREATION) The Trust issues and sells\nShares of each Fund only: in Creation Units on a continuous basis through the Principal Underwriter, without\na sales load (but subject to transaction fees), at their NAV per share next determined after receipt of an\norder, on any Business Day (as defined below), in proper form pursuant to the terms of the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement ( \u201c Participant Agreement \u201d ). A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to a Fund is,\ngenerally, any day on which the NYSE is open for business, with the exception of Veterans Day and Columbus\nDay.\n\n47\n\nFUND DEPOSIT The consideration for purchase of a Creation Unit of a Fund generally consists of either (i)\nthe Deposit Securities and the Cash Component (defined below), computed as described below or (ii) the cash\nvalue of the Deposit Securities and the \u201c Cash Component, \u201d computed as described below. When accepting\npurchases of Creation Units for cash, a Fund may incur additional costs associated with the acquisition of\nDeposit Securities that would otherwise be provided by an in-kind purchaser. Together, the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the Cash Component constitute the \u201c Fund Deposit, \u201d which\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of a Fund. The \u201c Cash\nComponent, \u201d which may include a Dividend Equivalent Payment, is an amount equal to the difference between\nthe net asset value of the Shares (per Creation Unit) and the market value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable. The \u201c Dividend Equivalent Payment \u201d enables a Fund to make a complete\ndistribution of dividends on the day preceding the next dividend payment date, and is an amount equal, on a\nper Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on all the portfolio securities of the Fund ( \u201c Dividend\nSecurities \u201d ) with ex-dividend dates within the accumulation period for such distribution (the \u201c\nAccumulation Period \u201d ), net of expenses and liabilities for such period, as if all of the Dividend\nSecurities had been held by the Fund for the entire Accumulation Period. The Accumulation Period begins on\nthe ex-dividend date for each Fund and ends on the day preceding the next ex-dividend date. If the Cash\nComponent is a positive number (i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the market value of the\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash Component shall be such positive amount. If the\nCash Component is a negative number (i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit is less than the market\nvalue of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the Cash Component. The Cash\nComponent serves the function of compensating for any differences between the net asset value per Creation\nUnit and the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of the Cash\nComponent excludes any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial\nownership of the Deposit Securities, if applicable, which shall be the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below). The Custodian, through NSCC, makes available on each Business Day, prior to\nthe opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time), the list of the names and the\nrequired number of shares of each Deposit Security or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, to\nbe included in the current standard Fund Deposit (based on information at the end of the previous Business\nDay) for a Fund. Such standard Fund Deposit is subject to any applicable adjustments as described below, in\norder to effect purchases of Creation Units of a Fund until such time as the next-announced composition of\nthe Deposit Securities or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, is made available. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit Securities or the amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable,\nrequired for a Fund Deposit for each Fund may be changed from time to time with a view to the investment\nobjective of the Fund. Information regarding the Fund Deposit necessary for the purchase of a Creation Unit\nis made available to Authorized Participants and other market participants seeking to transact in Creation\nUnit aggregations. The Trust intends to require the substitution of an amount of cash (i.e., a \u201c cash in\nlieu \u201d amount) to replace any Deposit Security that is a TBA transaction. The amount of cash contributed\nwill be equivalent to the price of the TBA transaction listed as a Deposit Security. As noted above, the\nTrust reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Cash to replace any Deposit\nSecurity, which shall be added to the Cash Component, including, without limitation, in situations where the\nDeposit Security: (i) may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery, (ii) may not be eligible for\ntransfer through the systems of DTC for corporate securities and municipal securities or the Federal Reserve\nSystem for U.S. Treasury securities; (iii) may not be eligible for trading by an Authorized Participant (as\ndefined below) or the investor for which it is acting; (iv) would be restricted under the securities laws or\nwhere the delivery of the Deposit Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of\nthe Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant becoming restricted under the securities laws, or (v) in\ncertain other situations (collectively, \u201c non-standard orders \u201d ). The Trust also reserves the right to: (i)\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of Deposit Cash; and (ii) include or remove\nDeposit Securities from the basket in anticipation of portfolio changes. The adjustments described above\nwill reflect changes, known to the Adviser on the date of announcement to be in effect by the time of\ndelivery of the Fund Deposit, in the composition of the subject Index being tracked by the relevant Fund or\nresulting from certain corporate actions.\n\n48\n\nPROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS To be eligible to place orders with the Principal Underwriter, as\nfacilitated via the Transfer Agent, to purchase a Creation Unit of a Fund, an entity must be (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party \u201d , i.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the\nContinuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a clearing agency that is\nregistered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see \u201c Book Entry Only System \u201d ), and (except with\nrespect to the SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International\nTreasury Bond ETF) must have the ability to clear through the Federal Reserve System. In addition, each\nParticipating Party or DTC Participant (each, an \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ) must execute a Participant\nAgreement that has been agreed to by the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer Agent, and that has been\naccepted by the Trust, with respect to purchases and redemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized\nParticipant will agree, pursuant to the terms of a Participant Agreement, on behalf of itself or any\ninvestor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that it will pay to the Trust, an\namount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component together with the creation transaction fee (described\nbelow) and any other applicable fees, taxes and additional variable charge. All orders to purchase Shares\ndirectly from a Fund, including non-standard orders, must be placed for one or more Creation Units and in\nthe manner and by the time set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or the applicable order form. The date\non which an order to purchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem Creation Units, as set forth below) is\nreceived and accepted is referred to as the \u201c Order Placement Date. \u201d An Authorized Participant may require\nan investor to make certain representations or enter into agreements with respect to the order (e.g., to\nprovide for payments of cash, when required). Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not\nhave executed a Participant Agreement and that, therefore, orders to purchase Shares directly from a Fund in\nCreation Units have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant that has\nexecuted a Participant Agreement. In such cases there may be additional charges to such investor. At any\ngiven time, there may be only a limited number of broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement\nand only a small number of such Authorized Participants may have international capabilities. On days when\nthe Exchange or the bond markets close earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to create Creation\nUnits to be placed earlier in the day. In addition, if a market or markets on which a Fund's investments are\nprimarily traded is closed, the Fund will also generally not accept orders on such day(s). Orders must be\ntransmitted by an Authorized Participant by telephone or other transmission method acceptable to the\nDistributor pursuant to procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement and in accordance with the\napplicable order form. Those placing orders through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time\nto permit proper submission of the purchase order by the cut-off time. Economic or market disruptions or\nchanges, or telephone or other communication failure may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or an\nAuthorized Participant. Fund Deposits must be delivered by an Authorized Participant through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government securities), or through DTC (for corporate securities and\nmunicipal securities), through a subcustody agent (for foreign securities) and/or through such other\narrangements allowed by the Trust or its agents. With respect to foreign Deposit Securities, the Custodian\nshall cause the subcustodian of a Fund to maintain an account into which the Authorized Participant shall\ndeliver, on behalf of itself or the party on whose behalf it is acting, such Deposit Securities. Foreign\nDeposit Securities must be delivered to an account maintained at the applicable local subcustodian. The Fund\nDeposit transfer must be ordered by the Authorized Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the\ndelivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, to the account of a\nFund or its agents by no later than the Settlement Date. The \u201c Settlement Date \u201d with respect to a creation\norder for a Fund is generally the first Business Day ( \u201c T+1 \u201d ) after the Order Placement Date. All\nquestions as to the number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable, and the\nvalidity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities or\ncash, as applicable, will be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The\namount of cash represented by the Cash Component must be transferred directly to the Custodian through the\nFederal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by the Custodian no later\nthan the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable,\nare not received in a timely manner by the Settlement Date, the creation order may be cancelled. Upon\nwritten notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a\nFund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery of Creation\nUnits so created generally will occur no later than the first Business Day following the day on which the\npurchase order is deemed received by the Distributor.\n\n49\n\nThe order shall be deemed to be received on the Business Day on which the order is placed provided that the\norder is placed in proper form prior to the applicable cut-off time and the federal funds in the appropriate\namount are deposited by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions), with the\nCustodian on the Settlement Date. If the order is not placed in proper form as required, or federal funds in\nthe appropriate amount are not received by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions)\non the Settlement Date, then the order may be deemed to be rejected and the Authorized Participant shall be\nliable to the Fund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom. A creation request is considered to be in \u201c\nproper form \u201d if all procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement, order form and this SAI are properly\nfollowed. Shortened settlement cycles are expected to be available, through which creation transactions can\nbe settled on the trade date in accordance with instructions provided by the Trust and/or Distributor.\nISSUANCE OF A CREATION UNIT Except as provided herein, Creation Units will not be issued until the transfer\nof good title to the Trust of the Deposit Securities or payment of Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the\npayment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the subcustodian has confirmed to the Custodian that\nthe required Deposit Securities (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the\nrelevant subcustodian or subcustodians, the Principal Underwriter and the Adviser shall be notified of such\ndelivery, and the Trust will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Units. In instances where the\nTrust accepts Deposit Securities for the purchase of a Creation Unit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in\nadvance of receipt by the Trust of all or a portion of the applicable Deposit Securities as described below.\nIn these circumstances, the initial deposit will have a value greater than the net asset value of the Shares\non the date the order is placed in proper form since in addition to available Deposit Securities, cash must\nbe deposited in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii) an additional amount of cash\nequal to a percentage of the market value as set forth in the Participant Agreement, of the undelivered\nDeposit Securities (the \u201c Additional Cash Deposit \u201d ), which shall be maintained in a general non-interest\nbearing collateral account. An additional amount of cash shall be required to be deposited with the Trust,\npending delivery of the missing Deposit Securities to the extent necessary to maintain the Additional Cash\nDeposit with the Trust in an amount at least equal to the applicable percentage, as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement, of the daily marked to market value of the missing Deposit Securities. The Trust may\nuse such Additional Cash Deposit to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time. Authorized Participants\nwill be liable to the Trust for all costs, expenses, dividends, income and taxes associated with missing\nDeposit Securities, including the costs incurred by the Trust in connection with any such purchases. These\ncosts will be deemed to include the amount by which the actual purchase price of the Deposit Securities\nexceeds the market value of such Deposit Securities on the day the purchase order was deemed received by the\nPrincipal Underwriter plus the brokerage and related transaction costs associated with such purchases. The\nTrust will return any unused portion of the Additional Cash Deposit once all of the missing Deposit\nSecurities have been properly received by the Custodian or purchased by the Trust and deposited into the\nTrust. In addition, a transaction fee as set forth below under \u201c Creation Transaction Fees \u201d will be charged\nin all cases and an additional variable charge may also be applied. The delivery of Creation Units so\ncreated generally will occur no later than the Settlement Date. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF CREATION UNITS The\nTrust reserves the right to reject an order for Creation Units transmitted in respect of a Fund at its\ndiscretion, including, without limitation, if (a) the order is not in proper form or the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not consist of the securities that the Custodian specified; (b) the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, delivered by the Authorized Participant are not as disseminated through the\nfacilities of the NSCC for that date by the Custodian; (c) the investor(s), upon obtaining the Shares\nordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding Shares of the Fund; (d) the acceptance of the\nFund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the acceptance or receipt of the order for a\nCreation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel to the Trust, be unlawful; or (f) in the event that\ncircumstances outside the control of the Trust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent, the Distributor and/or\nthe Adviser make it for all practical purposes not feasible to process orders for Creation Units. Examples\nof such circumstances include acts of God or public service or utility problems such as fires, floods,\nextreme weather conditions and power outages resulting in telephone, telecopy and computer failures; market\nconditions or activities causing trading halts; systems failures involving computer or other information\nsystems affecting the Trust, the Principal Underwriter, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent, DTC, NSCC,\nFederal Reserve System, or any other participant in the creation process, and other extraordinary events.\nThe Trust or its agents shall communicate to the Authorized Participant its rejection of an order. The\nTrust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and the Principal Underwriter are under no duty, however, to give\nnotification of any defects or\n\n50\n\nirregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall either of them incur any liability for the failure\nto give any such notification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and the Principal Underwriter\nshall not be liable for the rejection of any purchase order for Creation Units. Given the importance of the\nongoing issuance of Creation Units to maintaining a market price that is at or close to the underlying net\nasset value of a Fund, the Trust does not intend to suspend acceptance of orders for Creation Units. All\nquestions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form,\neligibility and acceptance for deposit of any securities to be delivered shall be determined by the Trust,\nand the Trust's determination shall be final and binding. REDEMPTION Shares may be redeemed only in Creation\nUnits at their net asset value next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by a\nFund through the Transfer Agent and only on a Business Day. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF A FUND, THE TRUST\nWILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN AMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors must accumulate enough Shares in the\nsecondary market to constitute a Creation Unit in order to have such Shares redeemed by the Trust. There can\nbe no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the public trading market at any time\nto permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number of Shares to constitute a redeemable Creation Unit. With\nrespect to each Fund, the Custodian, through the NSCC, makes available prior to the opening of business on\nthe Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m. Eastern time) on each Business Day, the list of the names and share\nquantities of securities designated by the Fund that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or\ncorrection) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day ( \u201c Redemption\nSecurities \u201d ). Redemption Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Redemption Securities or the Cash Redemption Amount (defined below) may\nbe changed from time to time with a view to the investment objective of a Fund. Redemption proceeds for a\nCreation Unit are paid either in-kind or in cash, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Trust. With\nrespect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit will consist of Redemption\nSecurities plus cash in an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the Fund Shares\nbeing redeemed, as next determined after a receipt of a request in proper form, and the value of the\nRedemption Securities (the \u201c Cash Redemption Amount \u201d ), less a fixed redemption transaction fee and any\napplicable additional variable charge as set forth below. In the event that the Redemption Securities have a\nvalue greater than the net asset value of the Fund Shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the\ndifferential is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, at the Trust's discretion, an Authorized Participant may receive the\ncorresponding cash value of the securities in lieu of the in-kind securities value representing one or more\nRedemption Securities. PROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS After the Trust has deemed an order for\nredemption received, the Trust will initiate procedures to transfer the requisite Redemption Securities and\nthe Cash Redemption Amount to the Authorized Participant by the Settlement Date. The \u201c Settlement Date \u201d\nwith respect to a redemption order for a Fund is generally T+1, the second Business Day ( \u201c T+2 \u201d ) or the\nthird Business Day ( \u201c T+3 \u201d ) after the Order Placement Date. With respect to in-kind redemptions of a\nFund, the calculation of the value of the Redemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be\ndelivered upon redemption will be made by the Custodian according to the procedures set forth under \u201c\nDetermination of Net Asset Value \u201d , computed on the Business Day on which a redemption order is deemed\nreceived by the Trust. Therefore, if a redemption order in proper form is submitted to the Principal\nUnderwriter by a DTC Participant by the specified time on the Order Placement Date, and the requisite number\nof Shares of a Fund are delivered to the Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per\napplicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, then the value of the Redemption Securities and the Cash\nRedemption Amount to be delivered will be determined by the Custodian on such Order Placement Date. If the\nrequisite number of Shares of the Fund are not delivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per\napplicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, the Fund will not release the underlying securities for\ndelivery unless collateral is posted in such percentage amount of missing Shares as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement (marked to market daily). With respect to in-kind redemptions of a Fund, in connection\nwith taking delivery of shares of Redemption Securities upon redemption of Creation Units, an Authorized\nParticipant must maintain appropriate custody arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other\ncustody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the Redemption Securities are\n\n51\n\ncustomarily traded (or such other arrangements as allowed by the Trust or its agents), to which account such\nRedemption Securities will be delivered. Deliveries of redemption proceeds generally will be made within\nT+1, T+2 or T+3. The order form specifies the date at which the delivery of redemption proceeds for a\nspecific Fund is generally expected to occur. Due to the schedule of holidays in certain countries, however,\nthe delivery of in-kind redemption proceeds may take longer than one, two or three Business Days, as\napplicable, after the day on which the redemption request is received in proper form. If the Authorized\nParticipant has not made appropriate arrangements to take delivery of the Redemption Securities in the\napplicable foreign jurisdiction and it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of the Redemption Securities in such jurisdiction, the Trust may, in its\ndiscretion, exercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the Authorized Participant will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. If it is not possible to make other such arrangements,\nor if it is not possible to effect deliveries of the Redemption Securities, the Trust may in its discretion\nexercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the redeeming investor will be required to receive\nits redemption proceeds in cash. In addition, an investor may request a redemption in cash that a Fund may,\nin its sole discretion, permit. In either case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the NAV of\nits Shares based on the NAV of Shares of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is\nreceived in proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and additional charge for requested cash\nredemptions specified above, to offset the Trust's brokerage and other transaction costs associated with the\ndisposition of Redemption Securities). A Fund may also, in its sole discretion, upon request of a\nshareholder, provide such redeemer a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of the\nRedemption Securities but does not differ in net asset value. An Authorized Participant submitting a\nredemption request is deemed to represent to the Trust that, as of the close of the Business Day on which\nthe redemption request was submitted, it (or its client) will own (within the meaning of Rule 200 of\nRegulation SHO) or has arranged to borrow for delivery to the Trust on or prior to the Settlement Date of\nthe redemption request, the requisite number of Shares of the relevant Fund to be redeemed as a Creation\nUnit. In either case, the Authorized Participant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i) it (or its client) has\nfull legal authority and legal right to tender for redemption the requisite number of Shares of the\napplicable Fund and to receive the entire proceeds of the redemption; and (ii) if such Shares submitted for\nredemption have been loaned or pledged to another party or are the subject of a repurchase agreement,\nsecurities lending agreement or any other arrangement affecting legal or beneficial ownership of such Shares\nbeing tendered, there are no restrictions precluding the tender and delivery of such Shares (including\nborrowed shares, if any) for redemption, free and clear of liens, on the redemption Settlement Date. The\nTrust reserves the right to verify these representations at its discretion, but will typically require\nverification with respect to a redemption request from a Fund in connection with higher levels of redemption\nactivity and/or short interest in the Fund. If the Authorized Participant, upon receipt of a verification\nrequest, does not provide sufficient verification of its representations as determined by the Trust, the\nredemption request will not be considered to have been received in proper form and may be rejected by the\nTrust. Redemptions of Shares for Redemption Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable federal\nand state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the\nright to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Trust could not lawfully deliver specific\nRedemption Securities upon redemptions or could not do so without first registering the Redemption\nSecurities under such laws. An Authorized Participant or an investor for which it is acting subject to a\nlegal restriction with respect to a particular security included in the Redemption Securities applicable to\nthe redemption of Creation Units may be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The Authorized Participant may\nrequest the redeeming investor of the Shares to complete an order form or to enter into agreements with\nrespect to such matters as compensating cash payment. Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer, \u201d ( \u201c QIB \u201d ) as such term is defined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act,\nwill not be able to receive Redemption Securities that are restricted securities eligible for resale under\nRule 144A. An Authorized Participant may be required by the Trust to provide a written confirmation with\nrespect to QIB status in order to receive Redemption Securities. The right of redemption may be suspended or\nthe date of payment postponed with respect to a Fund (1) for any period during which the Exchange is closed\n(other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (2) for any period during which trading on the Exchange\nis suspended or restricted; (3) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which\ndisposal of the Shares of the Fund or determination of the NAV of the Shares is not reasonably practicable;\nor (4) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\n\n52\n\nREQUIRED EARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS FOR CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL FUNDS Notwithstanding the foregoing, as\ndescribed in the Participant Agreement and/or the applicable order form, certain Funds may require orders to\nbe placed prior to the trade date, as described in the Participant Agreement or the applicable order form,\nin order to receive the trade date's net asset value. The cut-off time to receive the trade date's net asset\nvalue will not precede the calculation of the net asset value of a Fund's shares on the prior Business Day.\nOrders to purchase Shares of such Funds that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a\nholiday or a day (other than a weekend) that the equity markets in the relevant foreign market are closed\nmay not be accepted. Authorized Participants may be notified that the cut-off time for an order may be\nearlier on a particular Business Day, as described in the Participant Agreement and the applicable order\nform. CREATION AND REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES A transaction fee, as set forth in the table below, is\nimposed for the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the purchase or redemption of Creation\nUnits, as applicable. Authorized Participants will be required to pay a fixed creation transaction fee\nand/or a fixed redemption transaction fee, as applicable, on a given day regardless of the number of\nCreation Units created or redeemed on that day. A Fund may adjust the transaction fee from time to time. An\nadditional charge or a variable charge (discussed below) will be applied to certain creation and redemption\ntransactions, including non-standard orders and whole or partial cash purchases or redemptions. With respect\nto creation orders, Authorized Participants are responsible for the costs of transferring the securities\nconstituting the Deposit Securities to the account of the Trust and with respect to redemption orders,\nAuthorized Participants are responsible for the costs of transferring the Redemption Securities from the\nTrust to their account or on their order. Investors who use the services of a broker or other such\nintermediary may also be charged a fee for such services. Creation and Redemption Transaction Fees:\n                                                                                                   \n  Fund                                              TransactionFee*,**  MaximumTransactionFee*,**  \n  SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF                $1,500                     $6,000  \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF               $1,500                     $6,000  \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF                $1,500                     $6,000  \n  SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury              $1,500                     $6,000  \n  Bond ETF                                                                                         \n  SPDR FTSE International Government                            $1,500                     $6,000  \n  Inflation-Protected Bond ETF                                                                     \n                                                                                                   \n* From time to time, a Fund may waive all or a portion of its applicable transaction fee(s). An additional\ncharge of up to three (3) times the standard transaction fee may be charged to the extent a transaction is\noutside of the clearing process. ** In addition to the transaction fees listed above, the Funds may charge\nan additional variable fee for creations and redemptions in cash to offset brokerage and impact expenses\nassociated with the cash transaction. The variable transaction fee will be calculated based on historical\ntransaction cost data and the Adviser's view of current market conditions; however, the actual variable fee\ncharged for a given transaction may be lower or higher than the trading expenses incurred by a Fund with\nrespect to that transaction. Determination of Net Asset Value The following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the sections in the Prospectus entitled \u201c PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION \u201d\nand \u201c ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d NAV per Share for each Fund is computed by dividing the\nvalue of the net assets of the Fund (i.e., the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the\ntotal number of Shares outstanding. Expenses and fees, including the management fees, are accrued daily and\ntaken into account for purposes of determining NAV. The NAV of each Fund is calculated by State Street and\ndetermined once daily as of the close of the regular trading session on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange is open. Creation/redemption order cut-off times may be earlier\non any day that the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (or applicable exchange or market\non which a Fund's investments are traded) announces an early closing time. Any assets or liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at market rates on the\ndate of valuation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London time) as quoted by one or more sources. In calculating a\nFund's net asset value per Share, the Fund's investments are generally valued using market valuations. A\nmarket valuation generally means a valuation (i) obtained from an exchange, a pricing service, or a major\nmarket maker (or dealer) or (ii) based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of value supplied\nby an exchange, a pricing\n\n53\n\nservice, or a major market maker (or dealer). Each Fund relies on a third-party service provider for\nassistance with the daily calculation of the Fund's NAV. The third-party service provider, in turn, relies\non other parties for certain pricing data and other inputs used in the calculation of the Fund's NAV.\nTherefore, each Fund is subject to certain operational risks associated with reliance on its service\nprovider and that service provider's sources of pricing and other data. NAV calculation may be adversely\naffected by operational risks arising from factors such as errors or failures in systems and technology.\nSuch errors or failures may result in inaccurately calculated NAVs, delays in the calculation of NAVs and/or\nthe inability to calculate NAV over extended time periods. A Fund may be unable to recover any losses\nassociated with such failures. In the case of shares of other funds that are not traded on an exchange, a\nmarket valuation means such fund's published net asset value per share. Each Fund may use various pricing\nservices, or discontinue the use of any pricing service. Fixed-income assets are generally valued as of the\nannounced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange, and\ngenerally 4:00 p.m. EST for U.S. fixed-income assets. Fixed-income assets are generally valued at the mean\nof the bid and ask prices for bank loans and inflation protected securities, and at the bid price for all\nother fixed-income assets. Pursuant to Board approved valuation procedures, the Board has designated the\nAdviser as the valuation designee for each Fund. These procedures address, among other things, (i)\ndetermining (a) when market quotations are not readily available or reliable and (b) the methodologies to be\nused for determining the fair value of investments, and (ii) the use and oversight of third-party pricing\nservices for fair valuation. The Adviser is responsible for periodically reviewing the procedures, and the\nselected methodologies used, for their continuing appropriateness and accuracy, and making any changes or\nadjustments to the procedures and methodologies as appropriate. In the event that current market valuations\nare not readily available or are deemed unreliable, the Trust's procedures require the Adviser to determine\na security's fair value. In determining a fair value, the Adviser may consider, among other things, (i)\nprice comparisons among multiple sources, (ii) a review of corporate actions and news events, and (iii) a\nreview of relevant financial indicators (e.g., movement in interest rates, market indices, and prices from a\nFund's Index provider). In these cases, a Fund's net asset value may reflect certain portfolio securities'\nfair values rather than their market prices. The fair value of a portfolio instrument is generally the price\nwhich a Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon its current sale in an orderly market between market\nparticipants. Ascertaining fair value requires a determination of the amount that an arm's-length buyer,\nunder the circumstances, would currently pay for the portfolio instrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determination for a security is materially\ndifferent than the value that could be realized upon the sale of the security. In addition, fair value\npricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund's net asset value and the\nprices used by the Index. This may result in a difference between a Fund's performance and the performance\nof the Index. Dividends and Distributions The following information supplements and should be read in\nconjunction with the section in each Prospectus entitled \u201c DISTRIBUTIONS. \u201d GENERAL POLICIES Dividends from\nnet investment income, if any, are generally declared and paid monthly by each Fund. Distributions of net\nrealized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make\ndistributions on a more frequent basis for a Fund to improve index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, in all events in a manner consistent with the\nprovisions of the 1940 Act. Dividends and other distributions on Shares are distributed, as described below,\non a pro rata basis to Beneficial Owners of such Shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC Participants\nand Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners then of record with proceeds received from the Trust.\nManagement of the Trust reserves the right to declare special dividends if, in its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or advisable to preserve a Fund's eligibility for treatment as a RIC under the\nInternal Revenue Code or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes at the Fund level. DIVIDEND\nREINVESTMENT Broker dealers, at their own discretion, may offer a dividend reinvestment service under which\nShares are purchased in the secondary market at current market prices. Investors should consult their broker\ndealer for further information regarding any dividend reinvestment service offered by such broker dealer.\n\n54\n\nTaxes The following is a summary of certain federal income tax considerations generally affecting the Funds\nand their shareholders that supplements the discussions in the Prospectus. No attempt is made to present a\ncomprehensive explanation of the federal, state, local or foreign tax treatment of the Funds or their\nshareholders, and the discussion here and in each Prospectus is not intended to be a substitute for careful\ntax planning. The following general discussion of certain federal income tax consequences is based on the\nInternal Revenue Code and the regulations issued thereunder as in effect on the date of this SAI. New\nlegislation, as well as administrative changes or court decisions, may significantly change the conclusions\nexpressed herein, and may have a retroactive effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c\nADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION. \u201d TAXATION OF THE FUNDS Each Fund is treated as a separate corporation for\nfederal income tax purposes. A Fund therefore is considered to be a separate entity in determining its\ntreatment under the rules for RICs described herein and in the Prospectus. Losses in one series of the Trust\ndo not offset gains in any other series of the Trust and the requirements (other than certain organizational\nrequirements) for qualifying for treatment as a RIC are determined at the Fund level rather than at the\nTrust level. Each Fund has elected or will elect and intends to qualify each year to be treated as a\nseparate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, each Fund should not be subject to\nfederal income tax on its net investment income and capital gains, if any, to the extent that it timely\ndistributes such income and capital gains to its shareholders. In order to qualify for treatment as a RIC, a\nFund must distribute annually to its shareholders at least the sum of 90% of its taxable net investment\nincome (generally including the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses)\nand 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income, if any (the \u201c Distribution Requirement \u201d ) and also must meet\nseveral additional requirements. Among these requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of a Fund's\ngross income each taxable year must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain\nsecurities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or\nother income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and\nnet income derived from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships (the \u201c Qualifying Income\nRequirement \u201d ); and (ii) at the end of each quarter of a Fund's taxable year, its assets must be\ndiversified so that (a) at least 50% of the market value of its total assets must be represented by cash and\ncash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other\nsecurities limited, in respect to any one issuer, to an amount not greater in value than 5% of the value of\nthe Fund's total assets and to not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and\n(b) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S.\ngovernment securities or securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, the securities (other than securities\nof other RICs) of two or more issuers that it controls and that are engaged in the same, similar, or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the \u201c\nDiversification Requirement \u201d ). If a Fund fails to satisfy the Qualifying Income Requirement or the\nDiversification Requirement in any taxable year, the Fund may be eligible for relief provisions if the\nfailures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid with respect to\neach failure to satisfy the applicable requirements. Additionally, relief is provided for certain de minimis\nfailures of the Diversification Requirement where the Fund corrects the failure within a specified period of\ntime. In order to be eligible for the relief provisions with respect to a failure to meet the\nDiversification Requirement, a Fund may be required to dispose of certain assets. If these relief provisions\nwere not available to a Fund and it were to fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all\nof its taxable income would be subject to tax at the applicable corporate rate without any deduction for\ndistributions to shareholders, and its distributions (including capital gains distributions) generally would\nbe taxable as ordinary income dividends to its shareholders, subject to the dividends-received deduction for\ncorporate shareholders and the lower tax rates on qualified dividend income received by noncorporate\nshareholders. To requalify for treatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, the Fund would be required\nto satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and to distribute any earnings and profits from\nany year in which the Fund failed to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If a Fund failed to qualify as a\nRIC for a period greater than two taxable years, it would generally be required to pay a Fund-level tax on\ncertain net built-in gains recognized with respect to certain of its assets upon a disposition of such\nassets within five years of qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year. The Board reserves the right not to\nmaintain the qualification of a Fund for treatment as a RIC if it determines such course of action to be\nbeneficial to shareholders.\n\n55\n\nAs discussed more fully below, each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment\nincome and its capital gains for each taxable year. If a Fund meets the Distribution Requirement but retains\nsome or all of its income or gains, it will be subject to federal income tax to the extent any such income\nor gains are not distributed. A Fund may designate certain amounts retained as undistributed net capital\ngain in a notice to its shareholders, who (i) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount so\ndesignated, (ii) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the income tax paid by the Fund on\nthat undistributed amount against their federal income tax liabilities and to claim refunds to the extent\nsuch credits exceed their liabilities and (iii) will be entitled to increase their tax basis, for federal\nincome tax purposes, in their Shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount of undistributed net\ncapital gain included in their respective income over their respective income tax credits. If a Fund failed\nto satisfy the Distribution Requirement for any taxable year, it would be taxed as a regular corporation,\nwith consequences generally similar to those described in the preceding paragraph. Given the concentration\nof certain of the Indexes in a relatively small number of securities, it may not be possible for certain\nFunds to fully implement sampling methodologies while satisfying the Diversification Requirement. A Fund's\nefforts to satisfy the Diversification Requirement may affect the Fund's execution of its investment\nstrategy and may cause the Fund's return to deviate from that of the applicable Index, and the Fund's\nefforts to track the applicable Index may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy the Diversification\nRequirement. A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders in each calendar year an amount at least equal to 98% of its ordinary income\nfor the calendar year plus 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the twelve months ended October 31 of\nsuch year, subject to an increase for any shortfall in the prior year's distribution. Each Fund intends to\ndeclare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the\napplication of this 4% excise tax. A Fund may elect to treat part or all of any \u201c qualified late year loss \u201d\nas if it had been incurred in the succeeding taxable year in determining the Fund's taxable income, net\ncapital gain, net short-term capital gain, and earnings and profits. The effect of this election is to treat\nany such \u201c qualified late year loss \u201d as if it had been incurred in the succeeding taxable year in\ncharacterizing Fund distributions for any calendar year. A \u201c qualified late year loss \u201d generally includes\nnet capital loss, net long-term capital loss, or net short-term capital loss incurred after October 31 of\nthe current taxable year (commonly referred to as \u201c post-October losses \u201d ) and certain other late-year\nlosses. Capital losses in excess of capital gains ( \u201c net capital losses \u201d ) are not permitted to be\ndeducted against a RIC's net investment income. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, potentially\nsubject to certain limitations, a Fund may carry a net capital loss from any taxable year forward\nindefinitely to offset its capital gains, if any, in years following the year of the loss. To the extent\nsubsequent capital gains are offset by such losses, they will not result in U.S. federal income tax\nliability to the Fund and may not be distributed as capital gains to its shareholders. Generally, the Funds\nmay not carry forward any losses other than net capital losses. TAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014DISTRIBUTIONS Each\nFund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its investment company taxable\nincome (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), its net tax-exempt income, if any, and\nany net capital gain (net recognized long-term capital gains in excess of net recognized short-term capital\nlosses, taking into account any capital loss carryforwards). Each Fund will report to shareholders annually\nthe amounts of dividends paid from ordinary income and the amount of distributions of net capital gain.\nSince the Funds primarily hold investments that do not pay dividends, it is not expected that a substantial\nportion (if any) of the dividends paid by a Fund will qualify for either the dividends-received deduction\nfor corporations or the favorable income tax rates available to individuals on qualified dividend income.\nDistributions from a Fund's net short-term capital gains will generally be taxable to shareholders as\nordinary income. Distributions from a Fund's net capital gain will be taxable to shareholders at long-term\ncapital gains rates, regardless of how long shareholders have held their Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Although dividends generally will be treated\nas distributed when paid, any dividend declared by a Fund in October, November or December and payable to\nshareholders of record in such a month that is paid during the following January will be treated for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes as received by shareholders on December 31 of the calendar year in which it was\ndeclared.\n\n56\n\nIf a Fund's distributions exceed its earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the\ntaxable year may be treated as a return of capital to shareholders. A return of capital distribution\ngenerally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's cost basis and result in a higher capital\ngain or lower capital loss when the Shares on which the distribution was received are sold. After a\nshareholder's basis in the Shares has been reduced to zero, distributions in excess of earnings and profits\nwill be treated as gain from the sale of the shareholder's Shares. Under Section 163(j) of the Code, a\ntaxpayer's business interest expense is generally deductible to the extent of its business interest income\nplus certain other amounts. If a Fund earns business interest income, it may report a portion of its\ndividends as \u201c Section 163(j) interest dividends, \u201d which its shareholders may be able to treat as business\ninterest income for purposes of Section 163(j) of the Code. The Fund's \u201c Section 163(j) interest dividend \u201d\nfor a tax year will be limited to the excess of its business interest income over the sum of its business\ninterest expense and other deductions properly allocable to its business interest income. In general, a\nFund's shareholders may treat a distribution reported as a Section 163(j) interest dividend as interest\nincome only to the extent the distribution exceeds the sum of the portions of the distribution reported as\nother types of tax-favored income. To be eligible to treat a Section 163(j) interest dividend as interest\nincome, a shareholder may need to meet certain holding period requirements in respect of Fund Shares and\nmust not have hedged its position in Fund Shares in certain ways. Distributions that are reinvested in\nadditional Shares of a Fund through the means of a dividend reinvestment service, if offered by your broker-\ndealer, will nevertheless be taxable dividends to the same extent as if such dividends had been received in\ncash. A 3.8% Medicare contribution tax generally applies to all or a portion of the net investment income of\na shareholder who is an individual and not a nonresident alien for federal income tax purposes and who has\nadjusted gross income (subject to certain adjustments) that exceeds a threshold amount ($250,000 if married\nfiling jointly or if considered a \u201c surviving spouse \u201d for federal income tax purposes, $125,000 if married\nfiling separately, and $200,000 in other cases). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of the\nundistributed net investment income of certain shareholders that are estates and trusts. For these purposes,\ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains (generally including capital gain distributions and capital\ngains realized on the sale of Shares) are generally taken into account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. Distributions of ordinary income and capital gains may also be subject to foreign, state\nand local taxes depending on a shareholder's circumstances. TAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014SALE OF SHARES In\ngeneral, a sale of Shares results in capital gain or loss, and for individual shareholders, is taxable at a\nfederal rate dependent upon the length of time the Shares were held. A sale of Shares held for a period of\none year or less at the time of such sale will, for tax purposes, generally result in short-term capital\ngains or losses, and a sale of those held for more than one year will generally result in long-term capital\ngains or losses. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates.\nGain or loss on the sale of Shares is measured by the difference between the amount received and the\nadjusted tax basis of the Shares. Shareholders should keep records of investments made (including Shares\nacquired through reinvestment of dividends and distributions) so they can compute the tax basis of their\nShares. A loss realized on a sale of Shares may be disallowed if substantially identical Shares are acquired\n(whether through the reinvestment of dividends or otherwise) within a sixty-one (61) day period beginning\nthirty (30) days before and ending thirty (30) days after the date that the Shares are disposed of. In such\na case, the basis of the Shares acquired must be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss upon the\nsale of Shares held for six (6) months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of\nany amounts treated as distributions to the shareholder of long-term capital gain (including any amounts\ncredited to the shareholder as undistributed capital gains). COST BASIS REPORTING The cost basis of Shares\nacquired by purchase will generally be based on the amount paid for the Shares and then may be subsequently\nadjusted for other applicable transactions as required by the Internal Revenue Code. The difference between\nthe selling price and the cost basis of Shares generally determines the amount of the capital gain or loss\nrealized on the sale or exchange of Shares. Contact the broker through whom you purchased your Shares to\nobtain information with respect to the available cost basis reporting methods and elections for your\naccount.\n\n57\n\nTAXATION OF FUND INVESTMENTS Dividends and interest received by a Fund on foreign securities may give rise\nto withholding and other taxes imposed by foreign countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and\nthe United States may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If a Fund meets certain requirements, which include a\nrequirement that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's total assets at the close of its respective\ntaxable year consist of certain foreign securities (generally including foreign government securities), then\nthe Fund should be eligible to file an election with the IRS that may enable its shareholders, in effect, to\nreceive either the benefit of a foreign tax credit, or a tax deduction, with respect to certain foreign and\nU.S. possessions income taxes paid by the Fund, subject to certain limitations. Pursuant to this election, a\nFund would treat the applicable foreign taxes as dividends paid to its shareholders. Each such shareholder\nwould be required to include a proportionate share of those taxes in gross income as income received from a\nforeign source and must treat the amount so included as if the shareholder had paid the foreign tax\ndirectly. The shareholder may then either deduct the taxes deemed paid by him or her in computing his or her\ntaxable income or, alternatively, use the foregoing information in calculating any foreign tax credit the\nshareholder may be entitled to use against such shareholder's federal income tax. If a Fund makes this\nelection, the Fund will report annually to its shareholders the respective amounts per share of the Fund's\nincome from sources within, and taxes paid to, foreign countries and U.S. possessions. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in computing their alternative minimum tax liability. If a Fund does\nnot make this election, the Fund will be entitled to claim a deduction for certain foreign taxes incurred by\nthe Fund. In certain instances, the Fund might not elect to apply otherwise allowable U.S. federal income\ntax deductions for those foreign taxes, whether or not credits or deductions for those foreign taxes could\nbe passed through to its shareholders pursuant to the election described above. If the Fund does not elect\nto apply these deductions, taxable distributions you receive from the Fund may be larger than they would\nhave been if the Fund had taken deductions for such taxes. Under certain circumstances, if a Fund receives a\nrefund of foreign taxes paid in respect of a prior year, the value of Shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed through to shareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign taxes for\nthe current year could be reduced. Certain of the Funds' investments may be subject to complex provisions of\nthe Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to hedging transactions, straddles, integrated\ntransactions, foreign currency contracts, forward foreign currency contracts, and notional principal\ncontracts) that, among other things, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by a Fund (e.g.,\nmay affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund\nand defer losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to\nshareholders. These provisions also may require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of positions in its\nportfolio (i.e., treat them as if they were closed out) which may cause the Fund to recognize income without\nreceiving cash with which to make distributions to its shareholders in amounts necessary to satisfy the RIC\ndistribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. The Funds intend to monitor their\ntransactions, intend to make appropriate tax elections, and intend to make appropriate entries in their\nbooks and records in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and preserve the Funds' qualification for\ntreatment as RICs. Each Fund is required for federal income tax purposes to mark-to-market and recognize as\nincome for each taxable year its net unrealized gains and losses on certain futures contracts as of the end\nof the year as well as those actually realized during the year. Gain or loss from futures and options\ncontracts on broad-based indexes required to be marked to market will be 60% long-term and 40% short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Application of this rule may alter the timing and character of distributions to\nshareholders. A Fund may be required to defer the recognition of losses on futures contracts, options\ncontracts and swaps to the extent of any unrecognized gains on offsetting positions held by the Fund. It is\nanticipated that certain net gain realized from the closing out of futures or options contracts will be\nconsidered gain from the sale of securities and therefore will be qualifying income for purposes of the\nQualifying Income Requirement. Investments by a Fund in zero coupon or other discount securities will result\nin income to the Fund equal to a portion of the excess face value of the securities over their issue price\n(the \u201c original issue discount \u201d or \u201c OID \u201d ) each year that the securities are held, even though the Fund\nmay receive no cash interest payments or may receive cash interest payments that are less than the income\nrecognized for tax purposes. In other circumstances, whether pursuant to the terms of a security or as a\nresult of other factors outside the control of the Fund, a Fund may recognize income without receiving a\ncommensurate amount of cash. Such income is included in determining the amount of income that a Fund must\ndistribute to maintain its eligibility for treatment as a RIC and to avoid the payment of federal income\ntax, including the nondeductible 4% excise tax described above.\n\n58\n\nAny market discount recognized on a market discount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount\nbond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value, or below adjusted issue\nprice if issued with original issue discount. Absent an election by a Fund to include the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary\nincome rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the OID and/or market discount rules is not matched by a corresponding cash\nreceipt by a Fund, the Fund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to enable the Fund to\nmake distributions to its shareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a RIC and eliminate taxes at the\nFund level. Special rules apply if a Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds, such as Treasury Inflation-\nProtected Securities (TIPS). Generally, all stated interest on inflation-indexed bonds is taken into income\nby a Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of any positive inflation\nadjustment for a taxable year, which results from an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of\nthe bond, is treated as OID. The amount of a Fund's OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease a Fund's taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond\nmatures. As a result, the Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distribution\nrequirements for the applicable year. The amount of any negative inflation adjustments, which result from a\ndecrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includable in the Fund's taxable\nincome with respect to the bond for the taxable year; any remaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain circumstances, carried forward to reduce the amount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the bond in future taxable years. TAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS Certain\ntax-exempt shareholders, including qualified pension plans, individual retirement accounts, salary deferral\narrangements, 401(k) plans, and other tax-exempt entities, generally are exempt from federal income taxation\nexcept with respect to their unrelated business taxable income ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ). Under current law, a Fund\ngenerally serves to block UBTI from being realized by its tax-exempt shareholders. However, notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, tax-exempt shareholders could realize UBTI by virtue of their investment in a Fund where, for\nexample, (i) the Fund invests in REITs that hold residual interests in real estate mortgage investment\nconduits ( \u201c REMICs \u201d ) or (ii) Shares constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt\nshareholders within the meaning of section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Charitable remainder trusts\nare subject to special rules and should consult their tax advisors. The IRS has issued guidance with respect\nto these issues and prospective shareholders, especially charitable remainder trusts, are strongly\nencouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding these issues. Certain tax-exempt educational\ninstitutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on net investment income. For these purposes, certain dividends\nand capital gain distributions, and certain gains from the disposition of Shares (among other categories of\nincome), are generally taken into account in computing a shareholder's net investment income. FOREIGN\nSHAREHOLDERS Dividends, other than capital gains dividends, \u201c short-term capital gain dividends \u201d and \u201c\ninterest-related dividends \u201d (described below), paid by a Fund to shareholders who are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities will be subject to a 30% United States withholding tax unless a reduced rate of withholding\nor a withholding exemption is provided under applicable treaty law to the extent derived from investment\nincome and short-term capital gain or unless such income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness carried on through a permanent establishment in the United States. Nonresident shareholders are\nurged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of the United States withholding tax\nand the proper withholding form(s) to be submitted to a Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an\nappropriate IRS Form W-8 may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate. Dividends reported by\na Fund as (i) interest-related dividends, to the extent such dividends are derived from the Fund's \u201c\nqualified net interest income, \u201d or (ii) short-term capital gain dividends, to the extent such dividends are\nderived from the Fund's \u201c qualified short-term gain, \u201d are generally exempt from this 30% withholding tax. \u201c\nQualified net interest income \u201d is a Fund's net income derived from U.S.-source interest and original issue\ndiscount, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. \u201c Qualified short-term gain \u201d generally means the\nexcess of a Fund's net short-term capital gain for the taxable year over its net long-term capital loss, if\nany. In the case of Shares held through an intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund\nreports the payment as an interest-related dividend or as a short-term capital gain dividend. Non-U.S.\nshareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these rules to their\naccounts.\n\n59\n\nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold Shares comply with IRS requirements that will generally require\nthem to report information regarding U.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts with, such entities, a\n30% withholding tax may apply to Fund distributions payable to such entities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be\nexempt from the withholding described in this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government, provided that the shareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such agreement. BACKUP WITHHOLDING A Fund will be required in certain\ncases to withhold (as \u201c backup withholding \u201d ) on amounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided\nthe Fund either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, (3) has failed to\ncertify to the Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or (4) has not certified\nthat such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is\ncurrently 24%. Backup withholding will not be applied to payments that have been subject to the 30%\nwithholding tax on shareholders who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of the U.S. CREATION UNITS\nAn Authorized Participant who exchanges securities for Creation Units generally will recognize a gain or a\nloss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the market value of the Creation Units at the\ntime and the sum of the exchanger's aggregate basis in the securities surrendered plus the amount of cash\npaid for such Creation Units. A person who redeems Creation Units will generally recognize a gain or loss\nequal to the difference between the exchanger's basis in the Creation Units and the sum of the aggregate\nmarket value of any securities received plus the amount of any cash received for such Creation Units. The\nIRS, however, may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing \u201c wash sales, \u201d or on the basis that there has been no\nsignificant change in economic position. Any gain or loss realized upon a creation of Creation Units will be\ntreated as capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the securities exchanged therefor as\ncapital assets, and otherwise will be ordinary income or loss. Similarly, any gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption of Creation Units will be treated as capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the\nShares comprising the Creation Units as capital assets, and otherwise will be ordinary income or loss. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon the creation of Creation Units will generally be treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the securities exchanged for such Creation Units have been held for more than one\nyear, and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss realized upon the\nredemption of Creation Units will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Shares\ncomprising the Creation Units have been held for more than one year, and otherwise, will generally be short-\nterm capital gain or loss. Any capital loss realized upon a redemption of Creation Units held for six (6)\nmonths or less will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any amounts treated as\ndistributions to the applicable Authorized Participant of long-term capital gains with respect to the\nCreation Units (including any amounts credited to the Authorized Participant as undistributed capital\ngains). A Fund has the right to reject an order for Creation Units if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the\nFund and if, pursuant to section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund would have a basis in any\ndeposit securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. A Fund also\nhas the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial Share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If a Fund does issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a group of purchasers) that would,\nupon obtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser\n(or a group of purchasers) may not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of securities for Creation\nUnits. If a Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear additional costs and recognize more capital\ngains than it would if it redeems Creation Units in kind. Persons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units\nshould consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax treatment of any creation or redemption\ntransaction.\n\n60\n\nCERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Under promulgated Treasury regulations, if a shareholder\nrecognizes a loss on disposition of a Fund's shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or\n$10 million or more for a corporate shareholder (or certain greater amounts over a combination of years),\nthe shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of\nportfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A shareholder who fails to make the required disclosure to the IRS\nmay be subject to adverse tax consequences, including significant penalties. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer's\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisers to determine the\napplicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances. The foregoing discussion is a\nsummary only and is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning. Purchasers of Shares should\nconsult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of investing in such Shares, including under\nstate, local and other tax laws. Finally, the foregoing discussion is based on applicable provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code, regulations, judicial authority and administrative interpretations in effect on the\ndate hereof. Changes in applicable authority could materially affect the conclusions discussed above, and\nsuch changes often occur. STATE TAX MATTERS The discussion of state and local tax treatment is based on the\nassumptions that the Funds will qualify for treatment under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code as\nRICs and that each Fund will distribute all interest and dividends it receives to its shareholders. The tax\ndiscussion summarizes general state and local tax laws which are currently in effect and which are subject\nto change by legislative, judicial or administrative action; any such changes may be retroactive with\nrespect to the applicable Fund's transactions. Investors should consult a tax advisor for more detailed\ninformation about state and local taxes to which they may be subject. Many states grant tax-free status to\ndividends paid to you from interest earned on direct obligations of the U.S. government, subject in some\nstates to minimum investment requirements that must be met by the Fund. Investment in Government National\nMortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d ) or Federal National Mortgage Association ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d )\nsecurities, banker's acceptances, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities do not generally qualify for such tax-free treatment. The rules on exclusion of this\nincome are different for corporate shareholders. Capital Stock and Other Securities Each Fund issues Shares\nof beneficial interest, par value $.01 per Share. The Board may designate additional funds. Each Share\nissued by the Trust has a pro rata interest in the assets of the corresponding series of the Trust. Shares\nhave no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each Share is\nentitled to participate equally in dividends and distributions declared by the Board with respect to each\nFund, and in the net distributable assets of each Fund on liquidation. Each Share has one vote with respect\nto matters upon which a shareholder vote is required consistent with the requirements of the 1940 Act and\nthe rules promulgated thereunder. Shares of all series of the Trust ( \u201c Funds \u201d ) vote together as a single\nclass except that if the matter being voted on affects only a particular fund it will be voted on only by\nthat fund and if a matter affects a particular fund differently from other Funds, that fund will vote\nseparately on such matter. Under Massachusetts law, the Trust is not required to hold an annual meeting of\nshareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust (regardless of\nthe fund) have noncumulative voting rights for the election of Trustees. Under Massachusetts law, Trustees\nof the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders. Under Massachusetts law, shareholders of a business\ntrust may, under certain circumstances, be held personally liable as partners for obligations of the Trust.\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for acts or\nobligations of the Trust, requires that Trust obligations include such disclaimer, and provides for\nindemnification and reimbursement of expenses out of the Trust's property for any shareholder held\npersonally liable for\n\n61\n\nthe obligations of the Trust. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of\nshareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which the Trust itself would be unable to meet its\nobligations. Given the above limitations on shareholder personal liability, and the nature of each Fund's\nassets and operations, the risk to shareholders of personal liability is believed to be remote. Shareholder\ninquiries may be made by writing to the Trust, c/o the Distributor, State Street Global Advisors Funds\nDistributors, LLC at One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. Counsel and Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, located at 1111 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004,\nserves as counsel to the Trust. Ernst & Young LLP, located at 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts\n02116, serves as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Trust. Ernst & Young LLP performs\nannual audits of the Funds' financial statements and provides other audit, tax and related services. Local\nMarket Holiday Schedules The Trust generally intends to effect deliveries of the Funds' portfolio securities\non T+1, T+2 or T+3. The ability of the Trust to effect in-kind redemptions within one, two or three Business\nDays, as applicable, of receipt of a redemption request is subject, among other things, to the condition\nthat, within the time period from the date of the request to the date of delivery of the securities, there\nare no days that are local market holidays on the relevant Business Days. For every occurrence of one or\nmore intervening holidays in the local market that are not holidays observed in the United States, the\nredemption settlement cycle may be extended by the number of such intervening local holidays. In addition to\nholidays, other unforeseeable closings in a foreign market due to emergencies may also prevent the Trust\nfrom delivering securities within one, two or three Business Days, as applicable. The securities delivery\ncycles currently practicable for transferring portfolio securities to redeeming investors, coupled with\nlocal market holiday schedules, may require a delivery process longer than the standard settlement period.\nIn certain circumstances during the calendar year, the settlement period may be greater than seven calendar\ndays.

Theobligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on the       \n                         obligation is very strong.                                                         \n                         An obligation rated \u2018A' is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of     \n  A                      changes incircumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated   \n                         categories. However,the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on    \n                         the obligation is still strong.                                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However,        \n  BBB                    adverse economicconditions or changing circumstances are more likely to weaken     \n                         the obligor's capacity to meetits financial commitments on the obligation.         \n                         Obligations rated \u2018BB', \u2018B', \u2018CCC', \u2018CC', and \u2018C' are regarded as having           \n                         significant speculativecharacteristics. \u2018BB' indicates the least degree of         \n  BB, B, CCC, CC, and C  speculation and \u2018C' the highest. While suchobligations will likely have some       \n                         quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighedby large            \n                         uncertainties or major exposure to adverse conditions.                             \n                         An obligation rated \u2018BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative   \n  BB                     issues.However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse        \n                         business, financial, oreconomic conditions that could lead to the obligor's        \n                         inadequate capacity to meet its financialcommitments on the obligation.            \n                         An obligation rated \u2018B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated    \n                         \u2018BB', but theobligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments  \n  B                      on the obligation. Adversebusiness, financial, or economic conditions will likely  \n                         impair the obligor's capacity or willingnessto meet its financial commitments on   \n                         the obligation.                                                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent   \n                         uponfavorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to      \n  CCC                    meet its financialcommitments on the obligation. In the event of adverse           \n                         business, financial, or economicconditions, the obligor is not likely to have the  \n                         capacity to meet its financial commitments on theobligation.                       \n                         An obligation rated \u2018CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The \u2018CC'    \n  CC                     rating is usedwhen a default has not yet occurred but S&P Global Ratings expects   \n                         default to be a virtualcertainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.   \n                         An obligation rated \u2018C' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the      \n  C                      obligation isexpected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery  \n                         compared with obligationsthat are rated higher.                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018D' is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For      \n                         non-hybrid capitalinstruments, the \u2018D' rating category is used when payments on    \n                         an obligation are not made onthe date due, unless S&P Global Ratings believes      \n                         that such payments will be made within fivebusiness days in the absence of a       \n  D                      stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated graceperiod or 30          \n                         calendar days.

The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category;\nthe modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of\nthat generic rating category. Additionally, a \u201c (hyb) \u201d indicator is appended to all ratings of hybrid\nsecurities issued by banks, insurers, finance companies, and securities firms.* Note: For more information\non long-term ratings assigned to obligations in default, please see the definition \u201c Long-Term Credit\nRatings for Defaulted or Impaired Securities \u201d in the Other Definitions section of Moody's Rating Symbols\nand Definitions publication. * By their terms, hybrid securities allow for the omission of scheduled\ndividends, interest, or principal payments, which can potentially result in impairment if such an omission\noccurs. Hybrid securities may also be subject to contractually allowable write-downs of principal that could\nresult in impairment. Together with the hybrid indicator, the long-term obligation rating assigned to a\nhybrid security is an expression of the relative credit risk associated with that security. Fitch Ratings\nLtd.'s ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ) Corporate Finance Obligations \u2013 Long-Term Ratings: AAA: Highest Credit Quality. \u2018AAA'\nratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally\nstrong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely\naffected by foreseeable events. AA: Very High Credit Quality. \u2018AA' ratings denote expectations of very low\ncredit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not\nsignificantly vulnerable to foreseeable events. A: High Credit Quality. \u2018A' ratings denote expectations of\nlow credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may,\nnevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher\nratings. BBB: Good Credit Quality. \u2018BBB' ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently\nlow. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate, but adverse business or\neconomic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. BB: Speculative. \u2018BB' ratings indicate an\nelevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic\nconditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial\ncommitments to be met. B: Highly Speculative. \u2018B' ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.\nCCC: Substantial Credit Risk. \u2018CCC' ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present. CC: Very High\nLevels of Credit Risk. \u2018CC' ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk. C: Exceptionally High Levels\nof Credit Risk. \u2018C' indicates exceptionally high levels of credit risk.\n\nA-2\n\nAppendix B SPDR \u00ae Series Trust\nSPDR \u00ae Index Shares Funds\nSSGA Active Trust\n(each, a \u201c Trust \u201d or \u201c Fund, \u201d and, collectively, the \u201c Trusts \u201d or \u201c Funds \u201d ) PROXY VOTING POLICY AND\nPROCEDURES The Board of Trustees of the Trusts has adopted the following policy and procedures with respect\nto voting proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Trusts' investment portfolios. 1.

As an asset manager, State Street Global Advisors\nvotes its clients' proxies where the client has delegated proxy voting authority to it, and State Street\nGlobal Advisors votes these proxies and engages with companies in the manner that we believe will most\nlikely protect and promote the long-term economic value of client investments, as described in this\ndocument. 1 When engaging with and voting proxies with respect to the portfolio companies in which we invest\nour clients' assets, we do so on behalf of and in the best interests of the client accounts we manage and do\nnot seek to change or influence control of any such portfolio companies. The State Street Global Advisors\nGlobal Proxy Voting and Engagement Policy (the \u201c Policy \u201d ) contains certain policies that State Street\nGlobal Advisors will only apply in jurisdictions where permitted by local law and regulations. State Street\nGlobal Advisors will not apply any policies contained herein in any jurisdictions where State Street Global\nAdvisors believes that implementing or following such policies would be deemed to constitute seeking to\nchange or influence control of a portfolio company. Introduction At State Street Global Advisors, we take\nour fiduciary duties as an asset manager very seriously. Our primary fiduciary obligation to our clients is\nto maximize the long-term value of their investments. State Street Global Advisors focuses on risks and\nopportunities that may impact long-term value creation for our clients. We rely on the elected\nrepresentatives of the companies in which we invest \u2014 the board of directors \u2014 to oversee these firms'\nstrategies. We expect effective independent board oversight of the material risks and opportunities to a\nfirm's business and operations. We believe that appropriate consideration of these risks and opportunities\nis an essential component of a firm's long-term business strategy, and expect boards to actively oversee the\nmanagement of this strategy. Our Asset Stewardship Program State Street Global Advisors' Asset Stewardship\nTeam is responsible for developing and implementing this Policy, the implementation of third-party proxy\nvoting guidelines where applicable, case-by-case voting items, issuer engagement activities, and research\nand analysis of corporate governance issues and proxy voting items. The Asset Stewardship Team's activities\nare overseen by our internal governance body, State Street Global Advisors' Global Fiduciary and Conduct\nCommittee ( \u201c GFCC \u201d ). The GFCC is responsible for reviewing State Street Global Advisors' stewardship\nstrategy, engagement priorities, the Policy, and for monitoring the delivery of voting objectives. In order\nto facilitate the execution of our proxy votes, we retain Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. ( \u201c ISS \u201d\n). We utilize ISS to: (1) act as our proxy voting agent (providing State Street Global Advisors with vote\nexecution and administration services), (2) assist in applying the Policy, and (3) provide research and\nanalysis relating to general corporate governance issues and specific proxy items. State Street Global\nAdvisors does not follow the voting recommendations of any policy offered by ISS or any other proxy voting\npolicy provider in implementing the Policy. All voting decisions and engagement activities for which State\nStreet Global Advisors has been given voting discretion are undertaken in accordance with this Policy,\nensuring that the interests of our clients remain the sole consideration when discharging our stewardship\nresponsibilities. Exceptions to this policy include the use of an independent third party to vote on State\nStreet Corporation ( \u201c State Street \u201d ) stock and the stock of other State Street affiliated entities, to\nmitigate a\n\n1 This Policy is applicable to SSGA Funds Management, Inc., State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, and\nother investment advisory affiliates of State Street Corporation.\n\nC-1\n\nconflict of interest of voting on our parent company or affiliated entities, and other situations where we\nbelieve we may be conflicted from voting (for example, stock of a public company for which a State Street\ndirector also serves as a director, or due to an outside business interest). In such cases, delegated third\nparties exercise vote decisions based on their independent voting policy. We aim to vote at all shareholder\nmeetings where our clients have given us the authority to vote their shares and where it is feasible to do\nso. However, when we deem appropriate, we may refrain from voting at meetings in cases where: \u2022 Power of\nattorney documentation is required. \u2022 Voting would have a material impact on our ability to trade the\nsecurity. \u2022 Voting is not permissible due to sanctions affecting a company or individual. \u2022 Issuer-specific\nspecial documentation is required or various market or issuer certifications are required. \u2022 Certain market\nlimitations would prohibit voting (e.g., partial/split voting prohibitions or residency restrictions). \u2022\nUnless a client directs otherwise in so-called \u201c share blocking \u201d markets (markets where proxy voters have\ntheir securities blocked from trading during the period of the annual meeting). Additionally, we are unable\nto vote proxies when certain custodians used by our clients do not offer proxy voting in a jurisdiction or\nwhen they charge a meeting-specific fee in excess of the typical custody service agreement. Voting authority\nattached to certain securities held by State Street Global Advisors pooled funds may be delegated to an\nindependent third party as required by regulatory or other requirements. Under such arrangements, voting\nwill be conducted by the independent third party pursuant to its proxy voting policy and not pursuant to\nthis Policy. The State Street Global Advisors Proxy Voting Choice Program In addition to the option of\ndelegating proxy voting authority to State Street Global Advisors pursuant to this Policy, clients may\nalternatively choose to participate in the State Street Global Advisors Proxy Voting Choice Program (the \u201c\nProxy Voting Choice Program \u201d ), which empowers clients to direct the proxy voting of shares held by the\neligible fund or segregated account they own. Clients that participate in the Proxy Voting Choice Program\nhave the option of selecting a third-party proxy voting guideline from the policies included in the Proxy\nVoting Choice Program to apply to the vote of the client's pro rata share of the securities held by the\neligible fund or segregated account they own. This Policy does not apply to shares voted under the Proxy\nVoting Choice Program. Securities Not Voted Pursuant to the Policy Where clients have asked State Street\nGlobal Advisors to vote the client's shares on their behalf, including where a pooled fund fiduciary has\ndelegated the responsibility to vote the fund's securities to State Street Global Advisors, State Street\nGlobal Advisors votes those securities in a unified manner, consistent with the principles described in this\nPolicy. Exceptions to this unified voting policy are: (1) where State Street Global Advisors has made its\nProxy Voting Choice Program available to its separately managed account clients and investors within a fund\nmanaged by State Street Global Advisors, in which case a pro rata portion of shares held by the fund or\nsegregated account attributable to clients who choose to participate in the Proxy Voting Choice Program will\nbe voted consistent with the third-party proxy voting guidelines selected by the clients, (2) where a pooled\ninvestment vehicle managed by State Street Global Advisors utilizes a third party proxy voting guideline as\nset forth in that fund's organizational and/or offering documents, and (3) where voting authority with\nrespect to certain securities held by State Street Global Advisors pooled funds may be delegated to an\nindependent third party as required by regulatory or other requirements. With respect to such funds and\nseparately managed accounts utilizing third-party proxy voting guidelines, the terms of the applicable\nthird-party proxy voting guidelines shall apply in place of the Policy described herein and the proxy votes\nimplemented with respect to such a fund or account may differ from and be contrary to the votes implemented\nfor other portfolios managed by State Street Global Advisors pursuant to this Policy. Regional Nuances When\nvoting and engaging with companies, we may consider market-specific nuances that may be relevant to that\ncompany. We expect companies to observe the relevant laws and regulations of their respective markets, as\nwell as country-specific best practice guidelines and corporate governance codes, and to publicly disclose\ntheir level of compliance with the applicable provisions and requirements. Except where specified, this\nPolicy applies globally.\n\nC-2\n\nOur Proxy Voting and Engagement Principles State Street Global Advisors' proxy voting and engagement program\nfocuses on three broad principles: 1. Effective Board Oversight: We believe that well-governed companies can\nprotect and pursue shareholder interests better and withstand the challenges of an uncertain economic\nenvironment. Principally, a board acts on behalf of shareholders by protecting their interests and\npreserving their rights. In order to carry out their primary responsibilities, directors undertake\nactivities that include setting strategy and providing guidance on strategic matters, selecting the CEO and\nother senior executives, overseeing executive management, creating a succession plan for the board and\nmanagement, and providing effective oversight of material risks and opportunities relevant to their\nbusiness. Further, good corporate governance necessitates the existence of effective internal controls and\nrisk management systems, which should be governed by the board.\nWe view board quality as a measure of director independence, director succession planning, board diversity,\nevaluations and refreshment, and company governance practices. We believe independent directors are crucial\nto good corporate governance; they help management establish sound corporate governance policies and\npractices. We believe a sufficiently independent board is key to effectively monitoring management,\nmaintaining appropriate governance practices, and performing oversight functions necessary to protect\nshareholder interests. We also believe the right mix of skills, independence, diversity, and qualifications\namong directors provides boards with the knowledge and experience to manage risks and operating structures\nthat are often complex and industry-specific. 2. Disclosure: It is important for shareholders to receive\ntimely and accurate reporting of a company's financial performance and strategy so that they are able to\nassess both the value and risk of their investment. In addition to information related to strategy and\nperformance, companies should also provide disclosure relating to their approach to corporate governance and\nshareholder rights. Such information allows investors to determine whether their economic interests have\nbeen safeguarded by the board and provides insights into the quality of the board's oversight of management.\nUltimately, the board of directors is accountable for the oversight and disclosure of the material risks and\nopportunities faced by the company. 3. Shareholder Protection: State Street Global Advisors believes it is\nin the best interest of shareholders for companies to have appropriate shareholder rights and accountability\nmechanisms in place. As a starting place for voting rights, it is necessary for ownership rights to reflect\none vote for one share to ensure that economic interests and proxy voting power are aligned. This share\nstructure best supports the shareholders' right to exercise their proxy vote on matters that are important\nto the protection of their investment, such as share issuances and other dilutive events, authorization of\nstrategic transactions, approval of a shareholder rights plan, and changes to the corporate bylaws or\ncharter, among others. In terms of accountability to shareholders and appropriate checks and balances, we\nbelieve there should be annual elections of the full board of directors. Application of Principles These\nthree principles of effective board oversight, disclosure and shareholder protection apply across all of\nState Street Global Advisors' proxy voting decisions. When voting at portfolio companies in different\nmarkets, State Street Global Advisors may apply the principles in ways that are specific to a given market\nbased on factors such as availability of data, resources, disclosure practices, and size of holdings in our\nclients' accounts. Shareholder Proposals When voting our clients' proxies, we may be presented with\nshareholder proposals at portfolio companies that must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and in\naccordance with the principles set forth above. For proposals related to commonly requested disclosure\ntopics, we have developed the criteria found in Appendix A to assess the effectiveness of disclosure on such\ntopics in connection with these types of proposals. Engagement We conduct engagements with individual\nissuers to communicate the principles set forth in this Policy and to learn more about companies' strategy,\nboard oversight and disclosure practices. We do not seek to change or influence control of any portfolio\ncompany through these engagements. In addition, we encourage issuers to increase the amount of direct\ncommunication board members have with shareholders. We believe direct communication with executive board\nmembers and independent non- executive directors is critical to helping companies understand shareholder\nconcerns.\n\nC-3\n\nSection I. Effective Board Oversight Director Independence We believe independent directors are crucial to\ngood corporate governance; they help management establish sound corporate governance policies and practices.\nWe have developed criteria for determining director independence, which vary by region and/or local\njurisdiction. These criteria generally follow relevant listing standards, local regulatory requirements\nand/or local market practice standards. Such criteria may include: \u2022 Participation in related-party\ntransactions or other material business relations with the company \u2022 Employment history with the company \u2022\nStatus as founder or member of the founding family \u2022 Government representative \u2022 Excessive tenure and\npreponderance of long-tenured directors \u2022 Relations with significant shareholders \u2022 Close family ties with\nany of the company's advisers, directors or senior employees \u2022 Cross-directorships \u2022 Receipt of non-board\nrelated compensation from the issuer, its auditors or advisors \u2022 Company's own classification of a director\nas non-independent In some cases, State Street Global Advisors' criteria may be more rigorous than\napplicable local or listing requirements. Majority Independent Board We believe a sufficiently independent\nboard is key to effectively monitoring management, maintaining appropriate governance practices, and\nperforming oversight functions necessary to protect shareholder interests. Separation of Chair/CEO Our\nprimary focus is to ensure there is strong independent leadership of the board, in accordance with the\nprinciples discussed above. We generally believe the board is best placed to choose the governance structure\nthat is most appropriate for that company. Board Committees We believe that board committees are crucial to\nrobust corporate governance and should be composed of a sufficient number of independent directors. We use\nthe same criteria for determining committee independence as we do for determining director independence,\nwhich varies by region and/or local jurisdiction. Although we recognize that board structures may vary by\njurisdiction, where a board has established an audit committee and/or compensation/remuneration committee,\nwe generally expect the committee to be primarily, and in some cases, fully independent. Refreshment and\nTenure We believe that average board tenure should generally align with the length of the business cycle of\nthe respective industry in which a company operates. In assessing excessive tenure, we consider factors such\nas the preponderance of long tenured directors, board refreshment practices, classified board structures and\nthe business cycle for the industry in which a company operates. Director Time Commitments We believe a\ncompany's nominating committee is best placed to determine appropriate time commitments for the company's\ndirectors. We consider if a company publicly discloses its director time commitment policy (e.g., within\ncorporate governance guidelines, proxy statement, annual report, company website, etc.) and if this policy\nor associated disclosure outlines the factors that the nominating committee considers to assess director\ntime commitments during the annual policy review process.\n\nC-4\n\nBoard Composition We believe effective board oversight of a company's long-term business strategy\nnecessitates a diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, which may include a range of\ncharacteristics such as skills, gender, race, ethnicity, and age. By having a critical mass of diverse\nperspectives, boards could experience the benefits that may lead to innovative ideas and foster more robust\nconversations about a company's strategy. We recognize that many factors may influence board composition,\nincluding board size, geographic location, and local regulations, among others. Further, we believe that a\nrobust nominating and governance process is essential to achieving a board composition that is designed to\nfacilitate effective, independent oversight of a company's long-term strategy. We believe nominating\ncommittees are best placed to determine the most effective board composition and we encourage companies to\nensure that there are sufficient levels of diverse experiences and perspectives represented in the\nboardroom. Board Expertise We believe board members should have adequate skills to provide effective\noversight of corporate strategy, operations, and risks, including sustainability-related issues. Boards\nshould also have a regular evaluation process in place to assess the effectiveness of the board and the\nskills of board members to address issues, such as emerging risks, changes to corporate strategy, and\ndiversification of operations and geographic footprint. We believe nominating committees are best positioned\nto evaluate the skillset and expertise of both existing and prospective board members. However, we may take\nsuch considerations into account in certain circumstances. Board Accountability Oversight of Strategy and\nRisk\nWe believe that risk management is a key function of the board, which is responsible for setting the overall\nrisk appetite of a company and for providing oversight on the risk management process established by senior\nexecutives at a company. We allow boards to have discretion regarding the ways in which they provide\noversight in this area. However, we expect companies to disclose how the board provides oversight of its\nrisk management system and risk identification. Boards should also review existing and emerging risks that\nevolve in tandem with the changing political and economic landscape or as companies diversify or expand\ntheir operations into new areas. As responsible stewards, we believe in the importance of effective risk\nmanagement and oversight of issues that are material to a company. To effectively manage and assess the risk\nof our clients' portfolios, we expect our portfolio companies to manage risks and opportunities that are\nmaterial and industry-specific and that have a demonstrated link to long-term value creation, and to provide\nhigh-quality disclosure of this process to shareholders. When evaluating a board's oversight of risks and\nopportunities, we assess the following factors, based on disclosures by, and engagements with, portfolio\ncompanies: 1. Oversees Long-term Strategy \u2013 Articulates the material risks and opportunities and how those\nrisks and opportunities fit into the firm's long-term business strategy \u2013 Regularly assesses the\neffectiveness of the company's long-term strategy, and management's execution of this strategy 2.\nDemonstrates an Effective Oversight Process \u2013 Describes which committee(s) have oversight over specific\nrisks and opportunities, as well as which topics are overseen and/or discussed at the full-board level \u2013\nIncludes risks and opportunities in board and/or committee agendas, and articulates how often specific\ntopics are discussed at the committee and/or full- board level \u2013 Utilizes KPIs or metrics to assess the\neffectiveness of risk management processes \u2013 Engages with key stakeholders including employees and investors\n3. Ensures Effective Leadership \u2013 Holds management accountable for progress on relevant metrics and targets\n\nC-5\n\n\u2013 Integrates necessary skills and perspectives into the board nominating and executive hiring processes, and\nprovides training to directors and executives on topics material to the company's business or operations \u2013\nConducts a periodic effectiveness review 4. Ensures Disclosures of Material Information \u2013 Ensures\npublication of relevant disclosures, including those regarding material topics Compliance with Corporate\nGovernance Principles\nOur minimum expectation is that companies will comply with their respective market governance codes and/or\nstewardship principles. Issuers are encouraged to provide explanations of their level of compliance with\ntheir local market code and why their preferred governance structure (if not compliant with the code) serves\nshareholders' long-term interests. We will review governance practices at companies in selected indexes for\ntheir adherence to market governance codes and/or stewardship principles. Proxy Contests\nWe believe nominating committees that are comprised of independent directors are best placed to assess which\nindividuals are adequately equipped with the skills and expertise to fulfill the duties of board members,\nand to act as effective fiduciaries. While our default position is to support the committees' judgement, we\nconsider the following factors when evaluating dissident nominees: \u2022 Strategy presented by dissident\nnominees versus that of current management, as overseen by the incumbent board \u2022 Effectiveness, quality, and\nexperience of the management slate \u2022 Material governance failures and the level of responsiveness to\nshareholder concerns and market signals by the incumbent board \u2022 Quality of disclosure and engagement\npractices to support changes to shareholder rights, capital allocation and/or governance structure \u2022 Company\nperformance and, if applicable, the merit of a recovery plan \u2022 Expertise of board members with respect to\ncompany industry and strategy Board Oversight of Geopolitical Risk\nAs stewards of our clients' assets, we are aware of the financial risks associated with geopolitical risk,\nincluding risks arising from unexpected conflict between or among nations. We expect portfolio companies\nthat may be impacted by geopolitical risk to: \u2022 Manage and mitigate risks related to operating in impacted\nmarkets, which may include financial, sanctions-related, regulatory, and/or reputational risks, among\nothers; \u2022 Strengthen board oversight of these efforts; and \u2022 Describe these efforts in public disclosures.\nCompensation and Remuneration\nWe consider it the board's responsibility to determine the appropriate level of executive compensation.\nDespite the differences among the possible types of plans and awards, there is a simple underlying\nphilosophy that guides our analysis of executive compensation: we believe that there should be a direct\nrelationship between executive compensation and company performance over the long term. Shareholders should\nhave the opportunity to assess whether pay structures and levels are aligned with business performance. When\nassessing remuneration reports, we consider factors such as adequate disclosure of various remuneration\nelements, absolute and relative pay levels, peer selection and benchmarking, the mix of long-term and short-\nterm incentives, alignment of pay structures with shareholder interests, as well as with corporate strategy\nand performance. For example, criteria we may consider include the following: \u2022 Overall quantum relative to\ncompany performance \u2022 Vesting periods and length of performance targets \u2022 Mix of performance, time and\noptions-based stock units\n\nC-6\n\n\u2022 Use of special grants and one-time awards \u2022 Retesting and repricing features \u2022 Disclosure and transparency\nBoard Meeting Attendance\nWe expect directors to attend at least 75 percent of board meetings in the last financial year or provide an\nappropriate explanation for why they were unable to meet this attendance threshold. Section II. Disclosure\nIt is important for shareholders to receive timely and accurate reporting of a company's financial\nperformance and strategy so that they are able to assess both the value and risk of their investment. In\naddition to information related to strategy and performance, companies should provide disclosure relating to\ntheir approach to corporate governance and shareholder rights. Such information allows investors to\ndetermine whether their financial interests have been protected by the board and provides insights into the\nboard's oversight of management. Ultimately, the board of directors is accountable for the oversight and\ndisclosure of the material risks and opportunities faced by the company. Reporting Financial Statements\nWe believe the disclosure and availability of reliable financial statements in a timely manner is imperative\nfor investment analysis. We expect external auditors to provide assurance of a company's financial\ncondition. Sustainability-related Disclosures\nWe believe in the importance of effective risk management and governance of issues that are material to a\ncompany. This may include sustainability-related risks and opportunities where a company has identified such\nrisks and opportunities as material to its business. Such disclosure allows shareholders to effectively\nassess companies' oversight, strategy, and business practices related to these sustainability issues\nidentified as material. We look to companies to provide disclosure on sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities relevant to their businesses in line with applicable local regulatory requirements and any\nvoluntary standards and frameworks adopted by the company. Climate-related Disclosures\nWe believe that managing climate-related risks and opportunities is a key element in maximizing long-term\nrisk-adjusted returns for our clients. As a result, we have a longstanding commitment to enhancing investor-\nuseful disclosure related to this topic. For companies that have identified climate risk as material to\ntheir business, we expect the company to provide disclosure on climate-related risks and opportunities\nrelevant to their businesses in line with applicable local regulatory requirements and any voluntary\nstandards and frameworks adopted by the company. \u2022 We encourage the disclosure of Scope 1 and Scope 2\nemissions and related targets. However, State Street Global Advisors is not prescriptive in how a company\nsets its targets. We expect companies that have adopted net zero ambitions to disclose interim climate\ntargets. In each case, if a company chooses not to disclose any climate targets, we expect the company to\nprovide an explanation of how the company measures and monitors progress on managing climate-related risks\nand opportunities. \u2022 We do not expect any company to set Scope 3 targets. We encourage companies to identify\nand disclose the most relevant categories of Scope 3 emissions. However, we recognize that Scope 3 emissions\nestimates have a high degree of uncertainty. Therefore, if a company determines that categories of Scope 3\nemissions are impracticable to estimate, we encourage the company to explain the relevant limitations. We\nalso encourage companies to explain any efforts to address Scope 3 emissions, such as engagement with\nsuppliers, customers, or other stakeholders across the value chain, where relevant. Say-on-Climate Proposals\nWhile we generally believe in the importance of effective disclosure of climate-related risks a company has\ndeemed material to its business, we do not endorse annual advisory climate votes. Where management chooses\nto include a Say-on-Climate vote, we assess the company's climate-related disclosure in accordance with the\ncriteria listed in Appendix A. Board and Workforce Demographics\nWe expect disclosure on the composition of both the board and workforce.\n\nC-7\n\nSection III. Shareholder Protection Capital Share Capital Structure\nThe ability to raise capital is critical for companies to carry out strategy, to grow, and to achieve\nreturns above their cost of capital. The approval of capital raising activities is fundamental to a\nshareholder's ability to monitor the amounts of proceeds and to ensure capital is deployed efficiently.\nAltering the capital structure of a company is a critical decision for boards. When making such a decision,\nwe believe the company should disclose a comprehensive business rationale that is consistent with corporate\nstrategy and not overly dilutive to its shareholders. Our approach to share capital structure matters may\nvary by local market and jurisdiction, due to regional nuances. Such proposals may include: \u2022 Increase in\nAuthorized Common Shares \u2022 Increase in Authorized Preferred Shares \u2022 Unequal Voting Rights \u2022 Share\nRepurchase Programs Dividend Payouts (Japan Only )\nFor Japanese issuers, we are generally supportive of dividend payouts that constitute 30 percent or more of\nnet income; however we consider whether the payment may damage the company's long-term financial health.\nReorganization, Mergers and Acquisitions\nThe reorganization of the structure of a company or mergers often involve proposals relating to\nreincorporation, restructurings, liquidations, and other major changes to the corporation. We expect\nproposals to be in the best interests of shareholders, demonstrated by enhancing share value or improving\nthe effectiveness of the company's operations. We evaluate mergers and structural reorganizations on a case-\nby-case basis and expect transactions to maximize shareholder value. Some of the considerations include the\nfollowing: \u2022 Offer premium \u2022 Strategic rationale \u2022 Board oversight of the process for the recommended\ntransaction, including director and/or management conflicts of interest \u2022 Offers made at a premium and where\nthere are no other higher bidders \u2022 Offers in which the secondary market price is substantially lower than\nthe net asset value We also consider the following: \u2022 Offers with potentially damaging consequences for\nminority shareholders because of illiquid stock \u2022 Offers where we believe there is a reasonable prospect for\nan enhanced bid or other bidders \u2022 The current market price of the security exceeds the bid price at the\ntime of voting Related-Party Transactions\nSome companies have a controlled ownership structure and complex cross- shareholdings between subsidiaries\nand parent companies ( \u201c related companies \u201d ). Such structures may result in the prevalence of related-\nparty transactions between the company and its various stakeholders, such as directors and management,\nsubsidiaries and shareholders. In markets where shareholders are required to approve such transactions, we\nexpect companies to disclose details of the transaction, such as the nature, the value and the purpose of\nsuch a transaction. We also believe independent directors should ratify such transactions. Further, we\nbelieve companies should describe the level of independent board oversight and the approval process,\nincluding details of any independent valuations provided by financial advisors on related-party\ntransactions. Cross-Shareholdings (Japan Only)\n\u201c Cross-shareholdings \u201d are a long-standing feature of the balance sheets of many Japanese companies, but,\nin our view, can be detrimental for corporate governance practices and ultimately shareholder returns.\n\nC-8\n\nShareholder Rights Proxy Access\nIn general, we believe that proxy access is a fundamental right and an accountability mechanism for all\nlong-term shareholders. We consider proposals relating to proxy access on a case-by-case basis and consider\na balance between providing long-term shareholders accountability while preserving flexibility for\nmanagement to design a process that is appropriate for the company's circumstances. Vote Standards \u2022 Annual\nElections: We believe the establishment of annual elections of the board of directors is appropriate. We\nalso consider the overall level of board independence and the independence of the key committees, as well as\nthe existence of a shareholder rights plan. \u2022 Majority Voting: We believe a majority vote standard based on\nvotes cast for the election of directors is appropriate. Shareholder Meetings \u2022 Special Meetings and Written\nConsent: We believe the ability for shareholders to call special meetings, as well as act by written consent\nis appropriate. We believe an appropriate threshold for both calling a special meeting and acting by written\nconsent can be 25% of outstanding shares or less. \u2022 Notice Period to Convene a General Meeting: We expect\ncompanies to give as much notice as is practicable when calling a general meeting, generally at least 14\ndays. \u2022 Virtual/Hybrid Shareholder Meetings: We believe the right to hold shareholder meetings in a virtual\nor hybrid format is appropriate with the following best practices: \u2013 Afford virtual attendee shareholders\nthe same rights as would normally be granted to in-person attendee shareholders \u2013 Commit to time-bound\nrenewal (five years or less) of meeting format authorization by shareholders \u2013 Provide a written record of\nall questions posed during the meeting, and \u2013 Comply with local market laws and regulations relating to\nvirtual and hybrid shareholder meeting practices In evaluating these proposals we also consider the\noperating environment of the company, including local regulatory developments and specific market\ncircumstances impacting virtual meeting practices. Governance Documents & Miscellaneous Items Article\nAmendments\nWe believe amendments to company bylaws that may negatively impact shareholder rights (such as fee-shifting,\nforum selection, and exclusion service bylaws) should be put to a shareholder vote. We believe a majority\nvoting standard is generally appropriate. We generally believe companies should have a fixed board size, or\ndesignate a range for the board size. Anti-Takeover Issues\nOccasionally, companies add anti-takeover provisions that reduce the chances of a potential acquirer to make\nan offer, or to reduce the likelihood of a successful offer. We generally believe shareholders should have\nthe right to vote on reasonable offers. Our approach to anti-takeover issues may vary by local market and\njurisdiction, due to regional nuances. Accounting and Audit-Related Issues\nCompanies should have robust internal audit and internal control systems designed for effective management\nof any potential and emerging risks to company operations and strategy. The responsibility of setting out an\ninternal audit function lies with the audit committee, which should have independent non-executive directors\ndesignated as members. We believe the disclosure and availability of reliable financial statements in a\ntimely manner is imperative for investment analysis. As a result, board oversight of the internal controls\nand the independence of the audit process are essential if investors are to rely upon financial statements.\nIt is important for the audit committee to appoint external auditors who are independent from management as\nwe expect auditors to provide assurance of a company's financial condition.\n\nC-9\n\nState Street Global Advisors believes that a company's external auditor is an essential feature of an\neffective and transparent system of external independent assurance. Shareholders should be given the\nopportunity to vote on their (re-)appointment at the annual meeting. When appointing external auditors and\napproving audit fees, we will take into consideration the level of detail in company disclosures. In\ncircumstances where \u201c other \u201d fees include fees related to initial public offerings, bankruptcy emergence,\nand spin-offs, and the company makes public disclosure of the amount and nature of those fees which are\ndetermined to be an exception to the standard \u201c non-audit fee \u201d category, then such fees may be excluded\nfrom the non-audit fees considered in determining the ratio of non-audit to audit/audit-related fees/tax\ncompliance and preparation for purposes of determining whether non-audit fees are excessive. We believe a\ncompany should be able to discharge its auditors in the absence of pending litigation, governmental\ninvestigation, charges or fraud or other indication of significant concern. Further, we believe that\nauditors should attend the annual meeting of shareholders. Indemnification and Liability\nGenerally, we believe directors should be able to limit their liability and/or expand indemnification and\nliability protection if a director has not acted in bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of\nthe duties involved in the conduct of his or her office. Section IV. Shareholder Proposals We believe that\ncompany boards do right by investors and are responsible for overseeing strategy and company management.\nTowards that end, we generally do not support shareholder proposals that appear to impose changes to\nbusiness strategy or operations, such as increasing or decreasing investment in certain products or\nbusinesses or phasing out a product or business line or if it is not a topic that the company has deemed to\nbe material in their public disclosure documents. When assessing shareholder proposals, we fundamentally\nconsider whether the adoption of the resolution would promote long-term shareholder value in the context of\nour core governance principles: 1. Effective board oversight 2. Quality disclosure 3. Shareholder protection\nWe will consider supporting a shareholder proposal if: \u2022 the request is focused on enhanced disclosure of\nthe company's governance and/or risk oversight \u2022 the adoption of the request would protect our clients'\ninterests as minority shareholders; or \u2022 for common proposal topics for which we have developed assessment\ncriteria, the extent to which the request satisfies the criteria found in Appendix A. Section V. Engagement\nAs a fiduciary, State Street Global Advisors takes a comprehensive approach to engaging with portfolio\ncompanies. Our stewardship prioritization process allows us to proactively identify companies for engagement\nand voting in order to mitigate risks in our client's portfolios. Through engagement, we aim to build long-\nterm relationships with the issuers in which we invest on behalf of our clients and to address a broad range\nof topics relating to the promotion of long-term shareholder value creation. We do not seek to change or\ninfluence control of any portfolio company through engagement. Equity Engagements In general, there are\nthree types of engagements that State Street Global Advisors may hold on behalf of equity holders: 1.\nEngagements with Portfolio Companies in Connection with a Ballot Item or Other Topic In our Policy:\nEngagements held with portfolio companies to discuss a ballot item, event or other established topic found\nin our Policy. Such engagements generally, but not necessarily, occur during \u201c proxy season. \u201d They may be\nheld at the request of State Street Global Advisors or the portfolio company.\n\nC-10\n\n2. Off-Season Engagement at the Request of a Portfolio Company: From time- to-time, portfolio companies may\nseek to engage with State Street Global Advisors in the \u2018off-season' to discuss a particular topic. 3. Off-\nSeason Proactive Engagement Campaigns: Each year, State Street Global Advisors will identify thematic\nengagement campaigns on important topics for which we are seeking more information to potentially inform our\nfuture voting positions. Fixed Income Engagements From time-to-time, certain corporate action election\nevents, reclassifications or other changes to the investment terms of debt holdings may occur or an issuer\nmay seek to engage with State Street Global Advisors to discuss matters pertaining to the debt instruments\nthat State Street Global Advisors holds on behalf of its clients. In such instances, State Street Global\nAdvisors may engage with the issuer to obtain further information about the matter for purposes of its\ninvestment decision making. Such engagements are the responsibility of the Fixed Income portfolio management\nteam, but may be supported by State Street Global Advisors' Asset Stewardship Team. All election decisions\nare the responsibility of the relevant portfolio management team. In addition, State Street Global Advisors\nmay identify themes for engagement campaigns with issuers on topics that it believes may affect value of its\nclients' debt investments. State Street Global Advisors may proactively engage with portfolio companies and\nother issuers on these topics to help inform our views on the subject. Where such themes align with those\nrelating to equities, such engagements may be carried out jointly on behalf of both equity and fixed income\nholdings where there is mutual benefit for both asset classes. Such engagements are led by the State Street\nGlobal Advisors Asset Stewardship Team, but may also be attended by the relevant portfolio management teams.\nEngaging with Other Investors Soliciting State Street Global Advisors' Votes in Connection with Contested\nShareholder Meetings, Vote-No Campaigns, or Shareholder Proposals While it may be helpful to speak to other\ninvestors that are running proxy contests, putting forth vote-no campaigns, or proposing shareholder\nproposals at investee companies, we limit such discussions to investors who have filed necessary\ndocumentation with regulators and engage in these discussions at our own discretion. Our primary purpose of\nengaging with investors is: 1. To gain a better understanding of their position or concerns at investee\ncompanies. 2. In proxy contest situations: \u2013 To assess possible director candidates where investors are\nseeking board representation in proxy contest situations \u2013 To understand the investor's proposed strategy\nfor the company and investment time horizon to assess their alignment with State Street Global Advisors'\nviews and interests as a long-term shareholder Any information about our vote decisions are available in\nthis document and on our website. All requests for engagement should be sent to GovernanceTeam@ssga.com.\nSection VI. Other Matters Securities on Loan As a responsible investor and fiduciary, we recognize the\nimportance of balancing the benefits of voting shares and the incremental lending revenue for the pooled\nfunds that participate in State Street Global Advisors' securities lending program (the \u201c Funds \u201d ). Our\nobjective is to recall securities on loan and restrict future lending until after the record date for the\nrespective vote in instances where we believe that a particular vote could have a material impact on the\nFunds' long-term financial performance and the benefit of voting shares will outweigh the forgone lending\nincome. Accordingly, we have set systematic recall and lending restriction criteria for shareholder meetings\ninvolving situations with the highest potential financial implications (such as proxy contests and strategic\ntransactions including mergers and acquisitions, going dark transactions, change of corporate form, or\nbankruptcy and liquidation). Generally, these criteria for recall and restriction for lending only apply to\ncertain large cap indices in developed markets.\n\nC-11\n\nState Street Global Advisors monitors the forgone lending revenue associated with each recall to determine\nif the impact on the Funds' long-term financial performance and the benefit of voting shares will outweigh\nthe forgone lending income. Although our objective is to systematically recall securities based on the\naforementioned criteria, we must receive notice of the vote in sufficient time to recall the shares on or\nbefore the record date. When we do not receive timely notice, we may be unable to recall the shares on or\nbefore the record date. Reporting We provide transparency for our stewardship activities through our regular\nclient reports and relevant information reported online. We publish an annual stewardship report that\nprovides details of our stewardship approach, engagement and voting policies, and activities during the\nyear. The annual stewardship report is complemented by quarterly stewardship activity reports as well as the\npublication of thought leadership on governance and sustainability on our website. Our voting record\ninformation is available on Vote View, an interactive platform that provides relevant company details,\nproposal types, resolution descriptions, and records of our votes cast. Appendix A: Assessment Criteria for\nCommon Disclosure Topics As outlined above, the pillars of our Asset Stewardship Program rest on effective\nboard oversight, quality disclosure and shareholder protection. We are frequently asked to evaluate\nproposals on various topics, including requests for enhanced disclosure. Where a company receives a proposal\non a topic that the company has determined is material to its business, we will assess the proposal in\naccordance with the below criteria that we believe represent quality disclosure on commonly requested\ndisclosure topics. In each case, in assessing the proposal against the applicable criteria, we may review\nthe company's relevant disclosures against industry and market practice (e.g., peer disclosure, relevant\nframeworks, relevant industry guidance). Climate Disclosure Criteria For companies that have identified\nclimate-related risks or opportunities as material to their business, we expect the company to provide\ndisclosure on climate-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses in line with applicable\nlocal regulatory requirements and any voluntary standards and frameworks adopted by the company, as\ndescribed in the section related to Climate-Related Disclosures above. Additionally, where a company is\namong the highest emitters, we consider whether the company discloses: \u2022 Scenario-planning on relevant risk\nassessment and strategic planning processes; \u2022 The company's plans to achieve stated climate-related\ntargets, if any, including information on timelines and expected emissions reductions; and \u2022 Incorporation\nof relevant climate considerations in financial planning and/or capital allocation decisions.

For companies\nthat have adopted a net zero ambition and/or climate transition plan and that receive a related proposal, we\nassess the proposal against the disclosure criteria set out below. Given that climate related risks present\ndifferently across industries, our assessment of the below criteria may vary to account for best practices\nin specific industries.

Board of Directors\n\nVoting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections\n\nFour fundamental principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:\n\nIndependence:Boards should be sufficiently independent from management (and significant shareholders)\ntoensure that they are able and motivated to effectively supervise management\u2019s performance for the benefit\nof all shareholders, including in setting and monitoring the execution of corporate strategy, with\nappropriate use of shareholder capital, and in setting and monitoring executive compensation programs that\nsupport that strategy. The chair of the board should ideally be an independent director, and all boards\nshould have an independent leadership position or a similar role in order to help provide appropriate\ncounterbalance to executive management, as well as having sufficiently independent committees that focus on\nkey governance concerns such as audit, compensation, and nomination of directors.\n\nComposition:Companies should ensure that directors add value to the board through their specific skills\nandexpertise and by having sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size\nappropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and collaborative\nparticipation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range\nof perspectives.\n\nResponsiveness:Directors should respond to investor input, such as that expressed through significant\noppositionto management proposals, significant support for shareholder proposals (whether binding or non-\nbinding),and tender offers where a majority of shares are tendered.\n\nAccountability:Boards should be sufficiently accountable to shareholders, including through transparency of\nthecompany\u2019s governance practices and regular board elections, by the provision of sufficient information\nfor shareholders to be able to assess directors and board composition, and through the ability of\nshareholders to remove directors.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following circumstances\n(withnew nominees1 considered on case-by-case basis):\n\nIndependence\n\nVote against2 or withhold from non-independent directors (Executive Directors and Non-Independent Non-\nExecutive Directors per ISS\u2019Classification of Directors)when:\n                                                                         \n  \u25fe    Independent directors comprise 50\u00a0percent or less of the board;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                                  \n  \u25fe    The non-independent director serves on the audit, compensation, or nominating committee;  \n                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so that the full board functions  \n        as that committee; or                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n1A \u201cnew nominee\u201d is a director who is being presented for election by shareholders for the first time.\nRecommendations on new nominees who have served for less than one year are made on a case-by-case basis\ndepending on the timing of their appointment and the problematic governance issue in question.\n\n2In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use \u201cWithhold\u201d as the contrary vote option in director\nelections; companies with a majority vote standard use \u201cAgainst\u201d. However, it will vary by company and the\nproxy must be checked to determine the valid contrary vote option for the particular company.\n\nThe company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if the board attests that the independent directors\nfulfill the functions of such a committee.\n                                                         \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M    10\u00a0of\u00a082  \n                                                         \nISS Classification of Directors \u2013 U.S.\n                          \n  1.

Current interim officers are included in this category. For private companies, the\nequivalent positions are applicable. A non-employeedirector serving as an officer due to statutory\nrequirements (e.g. corporate secretary) will generally be classified as a Non-Independent Non-\nExecutiveDirector under \u201cAny material relationship with the company.\u201d However, if the company provides\nexplicit disclosure that the director is not receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000 per year\nfor serving in that capacity, then the director will be classified as an Independent Director. 2.\u201cAffiliate\u201d\nincludes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS uses 50 percent control ownership by the\nparent company as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an externally\nmanaged issuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate. 3.Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the\ncompany\u2019s initial public offering (IPO). 4.When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition\ncompany (SPAC) serving on the board of an acquired company, ISS will generally classify such directors as\nindependent unless determined otherwise taking into account the following factors: the applicable listing\nstandards determination of such director\u2019s independence; any operating ties to the firm; and the existence\nof any other conflicting relationships or related party transactions. 5.ISS will look at the terms of the\ninterim officer\u2019s employment contract to determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and\npension benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained in contracts of permanent, non-\ntemporaryCEOs. ISS will also consider if a formal search process was under way for a full-time officer at\nthe time. 6.\u201cImmediate family member\u201d follows the SEC\u2019s definition of such and covers spouses, parents,\nchildren, step-parents, step-children, siblings, in-laws,and any person (other than a tenant or employee)\nsharing the household of any director, nominee for director, executive officer, or significant shareholder\nof the company. 7.Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature, generally involve access\nto sensitive company information or to strategic decision-making, and typically have a commission- or fee-\nbasedpayment structure. Professional services generally include but are not limited to the following:\ninvestment banking/financial advisory services, commercial banking (beyond deposit services), investment\nservices, insurance services, accounting/audit services, consulting services, marketing services, legal\nservices, property management services, realtor services, lobbying services, executive search services, and\nIT consulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional relationships and not\nprofessional services: deposit services, IT tech support services, educational services, and construction\nservices. The case of participation in a banking syndicate by a non-leadbank should be considered a\ntransactional (and hence subject to the associated materiality test) rather than a professional\nrelationship. \u201cOf Counsel\u201d relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive\nany form of compensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a retired partner of, the firm\nproviding the professional service. The case of a company providing a professional service to one of its\ndirectors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional\nrather than a professional relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be\nprofessional services unless the company explains why such services are not advisory. 8.A material\ntransactional relationship, including grants to non-profitorganizations, exists if the company makes annual\npayments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity, exceeding the greater of: $200,000 or 5\npercent of the recipient\u2019s gross revenues, for a company that follows NASDAQ listing standards; or the\ngreater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u2019s gross revenues, for a company that follows NYSE\nlisting standards. For a company that follows neither of the preceding standards, ISS will apply the NASDAQ-\nbased materiality test. (The recipient is the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction).\n9.Dissident directors who are parties to a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement\nmay be classified as Independent Directors if an analysis of the following factors indicates that the voting\nagreement does not compromise their alignment with all shareholders\u2019 interests: the terms of the agreement;\nthe duration of the standstill provision in the agreement; the limitations and requirements of actions that\nare agreed upon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and if there any\nconflicting relationships or related party transactions.\n                                                         \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M    12\u00a0of\u00a082  \n                                                         \n10.Interlocks include: executive officers serving as directors on each other\u2019s compensation or similar\ncommittees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board); or executive officers sitting on each\nother\u2019s boards and at least one serves on the other\u2019s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence\nof such a committee, on the board).\n\n11.The operating involvement of the founder with the company will be considered; if the founder was never\nemployed by thecompany, ISS may deem him or her an Independent Director.\n\n12.For purposes of ISS\u2019s director independence classification, \u201cmaterial\u201d will be defined as a standard of\nrelationship(financial, personal, or otherwise) that a reasonable person might conclude could potentially\ninfluence one\u2019s objectivity in the boardroom in a manner that would have a meaningful impact on an\nindividual\u2019s ability to satisfy requisite fiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders.\n\nComposition\n\nAttendance at Board and Committee Meetings:Generally vote against or withhold from directors (exceptnominees\nwho served only part of the fiscal year3) who attend less than 75 percent of the aggregate of their board\nand committee meetings for the period for which they served, unless an acceptable reason for absences is\ndisclosed in the proxy or another SEC filing. Acceptable reasons for director absences are generally limited\nto the following:\n                                 \n  \u25fe    Medical issues/illness;  \n                                 \n                                 \n  \u25fe    Family emergencies; and  \n                                 \n                                                                                      \n  \u25fe    Missing only one meeting (when the total of all meetings is three or fewer).  \n                                                                                      \nIn cases of chronic poor attendance without reasonable justification, in addition to voting against the\ndirector(s) with poor attendance, generally vote against or withhold from appropriate members of the\nnominating/governance committees or the full board.\n\nIf the proxy disclosure is unclear and insufficient to determine whether a director attended at least 75\npercent of the aggregate of his/her board and committee meetings during his/her period of service, vote\nagainst or withhold from the director(s) in question.\n\nOverboarded Directors:Generally vote against or withhold from individual directors who:\n                                                         \n  \u25fe    Sit on more than five public company boards; or  \n                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Are CEOs of public companies who sit on the boards of more than two public companies besides their  \n        own\u2014 withhold only at their outside boards4.                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nNOTE: For shareholder meeting reports published on or after February 25th, 2025, Institutional Shareholder\nServices (ISS) has indefinitely halted the consideration of the gender diversity of a company\u2019s board when\nmaking vote recommendations with respect to the election or re-electionof directors at U.S. companies\ncovered by these guidelines under its proprietary ISS U.S. Benchmark policy.\n\nNominees who served for only part of the fiscal year are generally exempted from the attendance policy.\n\nAlthough all of a CEO\u2019s subsidiary boards with publicly-traded common stock will be counted as separate\nboards, ISS will not recommend a withhold vote for the CEO of a parent company board or any of the\ncontrolled (>50 percent ownership) subsidiaries of that parent but may do so at subsidiaries that are less\nthan 50 percent controlled and boards outside the parent/subsidiary relationships.\n                                                         \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M    13\u00a0of\u00a082  \n                                                         \nGender Diversity:Generally vote against or withhold from the chair of the nominating committee (or\notherdirectors on a case-by-case basis) at companies where there are no women on the company\u2019s board.

Shareholder Rights & Defenses\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon advance notice proposals, giving support to those proposalswhich\nallow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as reasonably possible and\nwithin the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice for company,\nregulatory, and shareholder review.\n\nTo be reasonable, the company\u2019s deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/nominations must be no earlier\nthan 120 days prior to the anniversary of the previous year\u2019s meeting and have a submittal window of no\nshorter than 30 days from the beginning of the notice period (also known as a 90-120-day window). The\nsubmittal window is the period under which shareholders must file their proposals/nominations prior to the\ndeadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent\u2019s\neconomic and voting position in the company so long as the informational requirements are reasonable and\naimed at providing shareholders with the necessary information to review such proposals.\n\nAmend Bylaws without Shareholder Consent\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote against proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.\n\nVote case-by-case on proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition to shareholders,\ntaking into account the following:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Any impediments to shareholders\u2019 ability to amend the bylaws (i.e. supermajority voting             \n        requirements);                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                          \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s ownership structure and historical voting turnout;  \n                                                                          \n                                                                           \n  \u25fe    Whether the board could amend bylaws adopted by shareholders; and  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                                 \n  \u25fe    Whether shareholders would retain the ability to ratify any board-initiated amendments.  \n                                                                                                 \nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing\nsowould enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to shareholders.\n\nVote against proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.\n\nVote for proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.\n\nControl share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting rights when they contribute to\nownership in excess of certain thresholds. Voting rights for those shares exceeding ownership limits may\nonly be restored by approval of either a majority or supermajority of disinterested shares. Thus, control\nshare acquisition statutes effectively require a hostile bidder to put its offer to a shareholder vote or\nrisk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder continues buying up a large block of shares.\n\nControl Share Cash-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share cash-outstatutes.\n                                                         \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M    27\u00a0of\u00a082  \n                                                         \nControl share cash-out statutes give dissident shareholders the right to \u201ccash-out\u201d of their position in a\ncompany at the expense of the shareholder who has taken a control position. In other words, when an investor\ncrosses a preset threshold level, remaining shareholders are given the right to sell their shares to the\nacquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a certain percentage of a\ncompany\u2019s stock to disgorge, or pay back, to the company any profits realized from the sale of that\ncompany\u2019s stock purchased 24 months before achieving control status. All sales of company stock by the\nacquirer occurring within a certain period of time (between 18 months and 24 months) prior to the investor\u2019s\ngaining control status are subject to these recapture-of-profits provisions.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon proposals to adopt fair price provisions (provisions that\nstipulatethat an acquirer must pay the same price to acquire all shares as it paid to acquire the control\nshares), evaluating factors such as the vote required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required\nto repeal the fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.\n\nGenerally vote against fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements greater than a majority of\ndisinterested shares.\n\nFreeze-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state freeze-outprovisions. Freeze-\noutprovisionsforce an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a company to wait a specified\nperiod of time before gaining control of the company.\n\nGreenmail\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or\notherwiserestrict a company\u2019s ability to make greenmail payments.\n\nVote case-by-case on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or bylaw amendments.\n\nGreenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock from individuals or groups\nseeking control of the company. Since only the hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial\npremium over the market value of its shares, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.\n\nShareholder Litigation Rights\n\nFederal Forum Selection Provisions\n\nFederal forum selection provisions require that U.S. federal courts be the sole forum for shareholders to\nlitigate claims arising under federal securities law.\n                                                         \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M    28\u00a0of\u00a082  \n                                                         \nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for federal forum selection provisions in the charter or bylaws\nthatspecify \u201cthe district courts of the United States\u201d as the exclusive forum for federal securities law\nmatters, in the absence of serious concerns about corporate governance or board responsiveness to\nshareholders.\n\nVote against provisions that restrict the forum to a particular federal district court; unilateral adoption\n(without a shareholder vote) of such a provision will generally be considered a one-time failure under the\nUnilateralBylaw/Charter Amendmentspolicy.\n\nExclusive Forum Provisions for State Law Matters\n\nExclusive forum provisions in the charter or bylaws restrict shareholders\u2019 ability to bring derivative\nlawsuits against the company, for claims arising out of state corporate law, to the courts of a particular\nstate (generally the state of incorporation).\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for charter or bylaw provisions that specify courts located within\nthestate of Delaware as the exclusive forum for corporate law matters for Delaware corporations, in the\nabsence of serious concerns about corporate governance or board responsiveness to shareholders.\n\nFor states other than Delaware, vote case-by-case on exclusive forum provisions, taking into consideration:\n                                                                       \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s stated rationale for adopting such a provision;

The comprehensiveness  \n        of the sales process (e.g., full auction, partial auction, no auction) can also affect shareholder  \n        value.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Conflicts of interest - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction disproportionately and         \n        inappropriately as compared to non-insider shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the  \n        directors and officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger than if they   \n  \u25fe    did not hold these interests. Consider whether these interests may have influenced these directors  \n        and officers to support or recommend the merger. The CIC figure presented in the \u201cISS Transaction   \n        Summary\u201d section of this report is an aggregate figure that can in certain cases be a misleading    \n        indicator of the true value transfer from shareholders to insiders. Where such figure appears to    \n        be excessive, analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether a potential conflict exists.  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Governance - Will the combined company have a better or worse governance profile than the current   \n  \u25fe    governance profiles of the respective parties to the transaction? If the governance profile is to   \n        change for the worse, the burden is on the company to prove that other issues (such as valuation)   \n        outweigh any deterioration in governance.                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                         \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M    41\u00a0of\u00a082  \n                                                         \nPrivate Placements/Warrants/Convertible Debentures\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon proposals regarding private placements, warrants, andconvertible\ndebentures taking into consideration:\n                                                                                                            \n        Dilution to existing shareholders\u2019 position: The amount and timing of shareholder ownership         \n        dilution should be weighed against the needs and proposed shareholder benefits of the capital       \n        infusion.

A negative market reaction     \n  \u25fe    may be a cause for concern.

Evaluate the           \n        valuation, market reaction, and potential conflicts of interest for deals that are announced close  \n        to the liquidation date.                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Negotiations and process - What was the process undertaken to identify potential target companies   \n  \u25fe    within specified industry or location specified in charter? Consider the background of the          \n        sponsors.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Conflicts of interest - How are sponsors benefiting from the transaction compared to IPO            \n        shareholders? Potential conflicts could arise if a fairness opinion is issued by the insiders to    \n        qualify the deal rather than a third party or if management is encouraged to pay a higher price     \n  \u25fe    for the target because of an 80\u00a0percent rule (the charter requires that the fair market value of    \n        the target is at least equal to 80\u00a0percent of net assets of the SPAC). Also, there may be sense of  \n        urgency by the management team of the SPAC to close the deal since its charter typically requires   \n        a transaction to be completed within the 18-24-month timeframe.                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Voting agreements - Are the sponsors entering into enter into any voting agreements/tender offers   \n  \u25fe    with shareholders who are likely to vote against the proposed merger or exercise conversion         \n        rights?                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Governance - What is the impact of having the SPAC CEO or founder on key committees following the   \n        proposed merger?                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Corporations (SPACs) - Proposals for Extensions\n\nThe main purpose of SPACs is to identify and acquire a viable target within a specified timeframe, and\nfailure to achieve this objective within the allotted time calls into question management\u2019s ability to\nexecute its primary objective.

SVT is expressed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and\nincludes the new shares proposed, shares available under existing plans, and shares granted but unexercised\n(using two measures, in the case of plans subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, as noted above).\nAll award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on the most expensive types of\nawards (for example, full-value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the\nmost expensive types.\n\nFor proposals that are not subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is\nreasonable if it falls below a company-specific benchmark. The benchmark is determined as follows: The top\nquartile performers in each industry group (using the Global Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are\nidentified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are established based on these top performers\u2019 historic\nSVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly correlated\nto SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the specific company by\nplugging the company-specific performance measures, size, and cash compensation into the industry cap\nequations to arrive at the company\u2019s benchmark.22\n\nThree-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA \u201cValue-Adjusted Burn Rate\u201d is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks are\ncalculated as the greater of: (1) an industry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the\ncompany\u2019s GICS group segmented by S&P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000 index;\nand (2) a de minimisthreshold established separately for each of the S&P 500, the Russell 3000 index less\nthe S&P 500, and thenon-Russell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be limited to a\npredetermined range above or below the prior year\u2019s burn-rate benchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is calculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn Rate = ((# of options * option\u2019s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-\nvalue awards * stock price)) / (Weighted average common shares * stock price).\n\nEgregious Factors\n\nLiberal Change in Control Definition\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the plan has a liberal definition of change in control and the equity\nawards could vest upon such liberal definition of change in control, even though an actual change in control\nmay not occur. Examples of such a definition include, but are not limited to, announcement or commencement\nof a tender offer, provisions for acceleration upon a \u201cpotential\u201d takeover, shareholder approval of a merger\nor other transactions, or similar language.\n\nFor plans evaluated under the Equity Plan Scorecard policy, the company\u2019s SVT benchmark is considered along\nwith other factors.\n                                                         \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M    50\u00a0of\u00a082  \n                                                         \nRepricing Provisions\n\nVote against plans that expressly permit the repricing or exchange of underwater stock options/stock\nappreciate rights (SARs) without prior shareholder approval. \u201cRepricing\u201d typically includes the ability to\ndo any of the following:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Amend the terms of outstanding options or SARs to reduce the exercise price of such outstanding     \n        options or SARs;                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Cancel outstanding options or SARs in exchange for options or SARs with an exercise price that is   \n        less than the exercise price of the original options or SARs;                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                    \n  \u25fe    Cancel underwater options in exchange for stock awards; or  \n                                                                    \n                                                     \n  \u25fe    Provide cash buyouts of underwater options.  \n                                                     \nWhile the above cover most types of repricing, ISS may view other provisions as akin to repricing depending\non the facts and circumstances.\n\nAlso, vote against or withhold from members of the Compensation Committee who approved repricing (as defined\nabove or otherwise determined by ISS), without prior shareholder approval, even if such repricings are\nallowed in their equity plan.\n\nVote against plans that do not expressly prohibit repricing or cash buyout of underwater options without\nshareholder approval if the company has a history of repricing/buyouts without shareholder approval, and the\napplicable listing standards would not preclude them from doing so.\n\nProblematic Pay Practices or Significant Pay-for-PerformanceDisconnect\n\nIf the equity plan on the ballot is a vehicle for problematic pay practices,vote against the plan.\n\nISS may recommend a vote against the equity plan if the plan is determined to be a vehicle for pay-for-\nperformance misalignment.

Standard stock options    \n        and performance-accelerated awards do not meet the criteria to be considered as performance-based   \n        awards. Further, premium-priced options should have a meaningful premium to be considered           \n        performance-based awards; and                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Second, assess the rigor of the company\u2019s performance-based equity program. If the bar set for the  \n        performance-based program is too low based on the company\u2019s historical or peer group comparison,    \n  \u25fe    generally vote for the proposal. Furthermore, if target performance results in an above target      \n        payout, vote for the shareholder proposal due to program\u2019s poor design.

Many companies have adopted policies that permit recoupment in cases where\nan executive\u2019s fraud, misconduct, or negligence significantly contributed to a restatement of financial\nresults that led to the awarding of unearned incentive compensation. However, such policies may be narrow\ngiven that not all misconduct or negligence may result in significant financial restatements. Misconduct,\nnegligence, or lack of sufficient oversight by senior executives may lead to significant financial loss or\nreputational damage that may have long-lasting impact.\n                                                         \n  W\u2009W\u2009W\u2009.\u2009I\u2009S\u2009S\u2009G\u2009O\u2009V\u2009E\u2009R\u2009N\u2009A\u2009N\u2009C\u2009E\u2009.\u2009C\u2009O\u2009M    58\u00a0of\u00a082  \n                                                         \nIn considering whether to support such shareholder proposals, ISS will take into consideration the following\nfactors:\n                                                                \n  \u25fe    If the company has adopted a formal recoupment policy;

Nonetheless, the Trust takes the position that it\nis not under common control with other trusts because the power residing in the respective boards and\nofficers arises as the result of an official position with the respective trusts.

In addition, indemnification is permitted only if it is determined that    \u2502\n\u2502  the actions in question did not render him/her liableby reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or     \u2502\n\u2502  gross negligence in the performance of his/her duties or by reason of reckless disregard ofhis/her      \u2502\n\u2502  obligations and duties to the Registrant. The Registrant may also advance money for litigation          \u2502\n\u2502  expenses provided that Trustees,officers, employees and/or agents give their undertakings to repay the  \u2502\n\u2502  Registrant unless their conduct is later determined to permitindemnification.Pursuant to Section 5.2    \u2502\n\u2502  of the Registrant\u2019s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, no Trustee, officer, employee or agent   \u2502\n\u2502  of theRegistrant shall be liable for any action or failure to act, except in the case of willful        \u2502\n\u2502  misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence orreckless disregard of duties to the Registrant. Pursuant   \u2502\n\u2502  to paragraph 9 of the Registrant\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement, the Advisershall not be liable for    \u2502\n\u2502  any action or failure to act, except in the case of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence  \u2502\n\u2502  or recklessdisregard of duties to the Registrant.Insofar as indemnification for liability arising       \u2502\n\u2502  under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cAct\u201d) may be permitted to directors, officers andcontrolling     \u2502\n\u2502  persons of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions of Rule 484 under the Act, or otherwise, the       \u2502\n\u2502  Registrant has been advisedthat in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public        \u2502\n\u2502  policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. Inthe event that a claim for           \u2502\n\u2502  indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses          \u2502\n\u2502  incurred or paidby a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful        \u2502\n\u2502  defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted bysuch director, officer or controlling person   \u2502\n\u2502  in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion ofits    \u2502\n\u2502  counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate          \u2502\n\u2502  jurisdiction the question whether suchindemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in    \u2502\n\u2502  the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.The Registrant hereby undertakes   \u2502\n\u2502  that it will apply the indemnification provision of its By-Laws in a manner consistent with             \u2502\n\u2502  Release11330 of the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), so long  \u2502\n\u2502  as the interpretation of Sections17(h) and 17(i) thereunder remains in effect.The Registrant maintains  \u2502\n\u2502  insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the            \u2502\n\u2502  Registrant, or whois or was serving at the request of the Registrant as a trustee, director, officer,   \u2502\n\u2502  employee or agent of another trust or corporation, againstany liability asserted against him/her and    \u2502\n\u2502  incurred by him/her or arising out of his/her position. However, in no event will the                   \u2502\n\u2502  Registrantmaintain insurance to indemnify any such person for any act for which the Registrant itself   \u2502\n\u2502  is not permitted to indemnify him/her.Item 31.Business and Other Connections of Investment AdviserAny   \u2502\n\u2502  other business, profession, vocation or employment of a substantial nature in which each director or    \u2502\n\u2502  principal officer of eachinvestment adviser is or has been, at any time during the last two fiscal      \u2502\n\u2502  years\u00a0(June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024), engaged for his or herown account or in the capacity of        \u2502\n\u2502  director, officer, employee, partner or trustee are as follows:SSGA FUNDS MANAGEMENT, INC.:SSGA FM      \u2502\n\u2502  serves as the investment adviser for each series of the Trust.
