The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n                  \n  Year 1  Year 3  \n  $24        $74  \n                  \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. The Fund had not commenced\noperations as of the date of this Prospectus\nand, as a result, does not yet have a\nportfolio turnover rate. The Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In seeking to track the\nperformance of the Bloomberg Barclays Emerging\nUSD Bond Core Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that\nthe Fund is not required to purchase all of\nthe securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser to the Fund, and/or\nState Street Global Advisors Limited (\u201cSSGA\nLTD\u201d or the \u201cSub-Adviser\u201d), the investment\nsub-adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined\nby the Adviser and/or Sub-Adviser to be in the\nbest interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective.\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but at least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the securities comprising the\nIndex and in securities that the Adviser\nand/or Sub-Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially\nidentical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are\nnot included in the Index, cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments, such\nas repurchase agreements and money market\nfunds (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser). In seeking to track the Index,\nthe Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to\nthe extent the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nSwaps and futures contracts may be used by the\nFund in seeking performance that corresponds\nto its Index and in managing cash flows. The\nIndex is designed to measure the performance\nof fixed-rate US dollar-denominated debt\nissued by sovereign and quasi-sovereign\n(government owned and government guaranteed)\nemerging market issuers. An emerging market is\na country that the World Bank Income group\nclassifies as low/middle income or the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) classifies\nas a non-advanced country. In addition, the\nIndex Provider (defined below) may classify a\ncountry as an emerging market based on factors\nsuch as investability concerns, the presence\nof capital controls, and/or geographic\nconsiderations. The Index includes bonds with\na minimum par amount outstanding of $500\nmillion, a remaining maturity of at least two\nyears and an original maturity of greater than\nfive years. Bonds rated Caa3/CCC-/CCC- or\nlower or Aa3/AA-/AA- or higher by any of\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard &\nPoor's Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Inc.,\nrespectively, are excluded from the Index.\nSEC-registered, Rule 144A and Regulation S\nbonds are each eligible for inclusion in the\nIndex. As of March 31, 2021, there were\napproximately 937securities in the Index. The\nIndex is calculated by the Index Provider (as\ndefined below) using a capped weighting\nmethodology. At each rebalance, each\nconstituent country within the Index is capped\nat 5% with respect to the total par amount\noutstanding of the Index. Any country weight\nexceeding the 5% limit will be redistributed\non a pro rata basis to the bonds of all other\ncountries in the Index that are below the 5%\ncap. The Index is rebalanced and reconstituted\nmonthly on the last business day of the month.\nThe Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which\nis not affiliated with the Fund, the Adviser\nor the Sub-Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Index. Principal Risks of\nInvesting in the Fund As with all investments,\nthere are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and\nyou could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other\npublic health issues, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. 2 Table of Contents Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk: Non-U.S. securities are\nsubject to political, regulatory, and economic\nrisks not present in domestic investments.\nThere may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to accounting, auditing, legal and\nfinancial report standards comparable to those\nin the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to\nrisks associated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility; differing securities market\nstructures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and settling portfolio\ntransactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities\nheld by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges\nthat are closed when the exchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed\nforeign market. These deviations could result\nin the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on\nforeign markets may be less liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities traded domestically.\nForeign governments may impose restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Certain countries have recently\nexperienced (or currently are expected to\nexperience) negative interest rates on certain\nfixed-income securities, and similar interest\nrate conditions may be experienced in other\nregions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify the Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and\nperformance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging markets include, among\nothers, greater political and economic\ninstability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities\nmarkets, possible trade barriers, currency\ntransfer restrictions, a more limited number\nof potential buyers and issuers, an emerging\nmarket country's dependence on revenue from\nparticular commodities or international aid,\nless governmental supervision and regulation,\nunavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial\nreporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for\nunfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The\nsecurities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections\nmay limit very significantly the liquidity of\nsecurities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of\nall companies in the country or region. The\nFund may be unable to liquidate its positions\nin such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater\nfor investments in frontier market countries,\nwhich typically have smaller economies or less\ndeveloped capital markets than traditional\nemerging market countries. Sovereign Debt\nObligations Risk: Investments in debt\nsecurities issued by governments or by\ngovernment agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental\nentities responsible for repayment may be\nunable or unwilling to pay interest and repay\nprincipal when due. Many sovereign debt\nobligations may be rated below investment-\ngrade (\u201cjunk\u201d bonds). Any restructuring of a\nsovereign debt obligation held by the Fund\nwill likely have a significant adverse effect\non the value of the obligation. In the event\nof default of sovereign debt, the Fund may be\nunable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral\nsecuring the debt. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares\nmay be bought and sold in the secondary market\nat market prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Below\nInvestment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-\nquality debt securities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or\n\u201cjunk\u201d bonds) are considered predominantly\nspeculative, and can involve a substantially\ngreater risk of default than higher quality\ndebt securities. Issuers of lower-quality debt\nsecurities may have substantially greater risk\nof insolvency or bankruptcy than issuers of\nhigher-quality debt securities. They can be\nilliquid, and their values can have\nsignificant volatility and may decline\nsignificantly over short periods of time.\nLower-quality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or\nthe market or economy in general. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be subject to credit risk\nwith respect to the counterparties with which\nthe Fund enters into derivatives contracts,\nrepurchase agreements, reverse repurchase\nagreements, and other transactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund may be unable to\nterminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, or to recover\ncollateral posted to the counterparty,\nresulting in a loss to the Fund. 3 Table of\nContents If the Fund holds collateral posted\nby its counterparty, it may be delayed or\nprevented from realizing on the collateral in\nthe event of a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding relating to the counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk: Derivative transactions can\ncreate investment leverage and may have\nsignificant volatility. It is possible that a\nderivative transaction will result in a much\ngreater loss than the principal amount\ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out a derivative transaction at a\nfavorable time or price. The counterparty to a\nderivatives contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments,\nreturn the Fund's margin, or otherwise honor\nits obligations. A derivatives transaction may\nnot behave in the manner anticipated by the\nAdviser or may not have the effect on the Fund\nanticipated by the Adviser. Income Risk: The\nFund's income may decline due to falling\ninterest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem\nthe securities during periods of falling\ninterest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying\nlower interest rates. If an obligation held by\nthe Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment in other obligations\npaying income at lower rates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of\nthe current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising\nthe Index. This differs from an actively-\nmanaged fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio managed using an active\ninvestment strategy. The structure and\ncomposition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index\nand, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. When there\nare changes made to the component securities\nof the Index and the Fund in turn makes\nsimilar changes to its portfolio, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities\nholdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its\nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income\ntax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance of the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's return may not match the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, generally as a result\nof cash flows into or out of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held by the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track\nthe Index return by investing in fewer than\nall of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index,\npotentially increasing the risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's return and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market\nor restrictions on resale may limit the\nability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\nsecurities may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet\nredemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in\nany illiquid securities and/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and selling such investments,\nmay be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. New\nFund Risk: The Fund is new and there is no\nassurance that the Fund will grow quickly.\nWhen the Fund's size is small, the Fund may\nexperience low trading volume, which could\nlead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif the Fund does not meet certain conditions\nof the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could cause elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its shareholders. Non-\nDiversification Risk: As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of\nportfolio securities than many other funds. To\nthe extent the Fund invests in a relatively\nsmall number of issuers, a decline in the\nmarket value of a particular security held by\nthe Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. The Fund may become diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one\nor more component securities). Restricted\nSecurities Risk: The Fund may hold securities\nthat have not been registered for sale to the\npublic under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nThere can be no assurance that a trading\nmarket will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Limitations on\nthe resale of these securities may have an\nadverse effect on their marketability, and may\nprevent the Fund from disposing of them\npromptly at reasonable prices. The Fund may\nhave to bear the expense of registering the\nsecurities for resale and the risk of\nsubstantial delays in effecting the\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may\nbe difficult to value because market\nquotations may not be readily available, and\nthe securities may have significant\nvolatility. 4 Table of Contents Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio holdings, potentially a\nlarge portion of the Fund's investment\nportfolio, may be valued on the basis of\nfactors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or\nreduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding\nwhen market quotations are not readily\navailable. The value established for any\nportfolio holding at a point in time might\ndiffer from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced\nusing market quotations. Portfolio holdings\nthat are valued using techniques other than\nmarket quotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. Fund Performance The Fund had not\ncommenced operations as of the date of this\nProspectus.Once the Fund has completed a full\ncalendar year of operations, a bar chart and\ntable will be included that will provide some\nindication of the risks of investing in the\nFund by showing the variability of the Fund's\nreturns based on net assets and comparing the\nFund's performance to the Index. When\navailable, updated performance information may\nbe obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting the Fund's website:\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Portfolio\nManagement Investment Adviser and Sub-Adviser\nSSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d) serves as the investment adviser to\nthe Fund. SSGA LTD, an affiliate of the\nAdviser, serves as investment sub-adviser to\nthe Fund, subject to supervision by the\nAdviser and oversight by the Trust's Board of\nTrustees. To the extent that a reference in\nthis Prospectus refers to the Adviser, with\nrespect to the Fund, such reference should\nalso be read to refer to SSGA LTD, where the\ncontext requires. Portfolio Managers The\nprofessionals primarily responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund are Orhan\nImer, Abhishek Kumar and James Kramer. Orhan\nImer, CFA, Ph.D., is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nFixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 2017. Abhishek Kumar is a\nManaging Director and the Sector Head for\nEmerging Markets Debt within the Fixed Income\nBeta Solutions Team at SSGA LTD. He joined\nSSGA LTD in 2010. James Kramer is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1996. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc. (the \u201cExchange\u201d), other national\nsecurities exchanges, electronic crossing\nnetworks and other alternative trading systems\nthrough your broker-dealer at market prices.\nBecause Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund\nShares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund\nShares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is\nwilling to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the\n\u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information\nregarding the Fund's NAV, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax\nInformation The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or\ncapital gains, unless you are investing\nthrough a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as\na 401(k) plan or individual retirement\naccount. Any withdrawals made from such tax-\nadvantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\n5 Table of Contents Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 6\nTable of Contents Additional Strategies\nInformation Principal Strategies General .\nPlease see \u201cThe Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy\u201d section under \u201cFund Summary\u201d above\nfor a complete discussion of the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy. The Fund may\ninvest in various types of securities and\nengage in various investment techniques which\nare not the principal focus of the Fund and\ntherefore are not described in this\nProspectus. These securities, techniques and\npractices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain\nfree of charge by contacting shareholder\nservices (see the back cover of this\nProspectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of\nthe Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e.,\nobtain a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex). A number of factors may affect the\nFund's ability to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index, and there can be\nno guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high\ndegree of correlation. For example, the Fund\nmay not be able to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index when there are\npractical difficulties or substantial costs\ninvolved in compiling a portfolio of\nsecurities to follow the Index, when a\nsecurity in the Index becomes temporarily\nilliquid, unavailable or less liquid, or legal\nrestrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from\ninvesting in a security in the Index. The\nAdviser will utilize a sampling strategy in\nmanaging the Fund. Sampling means that the\nAdviser uses quantitative analysis to select\nsecurities, including securities in the Index,\noutside of the Index and derivatives that have\na similar investment profile as the Index in\nterms of key risk factors, performance\nattributes and other economic characteristics.\nThese include industry weightings, market\ncapitalization, and other financial\ncharacteristics of securities. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nIn addition, from time to time, securities are\nadded to or removed from the Index. The\nAdviser may sell securities that are\nrepresented in the Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in the\nIndex, in anticipation of their removal from\nor addition to the Index. Further, the Adviser\nmay choose to overweight securities in the\nIndex, purchase or sell securities not in the\nIndex, or utilize various combinations of\nother available techniques, in seeking to\ntrack the Index. The Fund, as described in the\nSAI, has adopted a non-fundamental investment\npolicy to invest at least 80% of its net\nassets, plus the amount of borrowings for\ninvestment purposes, in investments suggested\nby its name, measured at the time of\ninvestment. The Fund will provide shareholders\nwith at least 60 days' notice prior to any\nchange in this non-fundamental 80% investment\npolicy. The Board of Trustees of the Trust\n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change the Fund's investment\nstrategy, Index and other policies without\nshareholder approval, except as otherwise\nindicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI.\nThe Board may also change the Fund's\ninvestment objective without shareholder\napproval. Non-Principal Strategies Certain\nOther Investments . The Fund may invest in\nstructured notes (notes on which the amount of\nprincipal repayment and interest payments are\nbased on the movement of one or more specified\nfactors such as the movement of a particular\nsecurity or index), swaps, options and futures\ncontracts. Swaps, options and futures\ncontracts and structured notes may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that\ncorresponds to its Index and in managing cash\nflows. Temporary Defensive Positions . In\ncertain situations or market conditions, the\nFund may temporarily depart from its normal\ninvestment policies and strategies, provided\nthat the alternative is consistent with the\nFund's investment objective and is in the best\ninterest of the Fund. For example, the Fund\nmay make larger than normal investments in\nderivatives to maintain exposure to its Index\nif it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . The Fund\nmay borrow money from a bank as permitted by\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or\nother regulatory agency with authority over\nthe Fund, but only for temporary or emergency\npurposes. The Fund may also invest in reverse\nrepurchase agreements, which are considered\nborrowings under the 1940 Act. Although the\n1940 Act presently allows the Fund to borrow\nfrom any bank (including pledging, mortgaging\nor hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33\n1/ 3% of its total assets (not including\ntemporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of\nits total assets), and there is no percentage\nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nunder normal circumstances any borrowings by\nthe Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's\ntotal assets. 7 Table of Contents Lending of\nSecurities . The Fund may lend its portfolio\nsecurities in an amount not to exceed 40% of\nthe value of its net assets via a securities\nlending program through its securities lending\nagent, State Street Bank and Trust Company\n(\u201cState Street\u201d or the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to\nbrokers, dealers and other financial\ninstitutions desiring to borrow securities to\ncomplete transactions and for other purposes.\nA securities lending program allows the Fund\nto receive a portion of the income generated\nby lending its securities and investing the\nrespective collateral. The Fund will receive\ncollateral for each loaned security which is\nat least equal to the market value of that\nsecurity, marked to market each trading day.\nIn the securities lending program, the\nborrower generally has the right to vote the\nloaned securities; however, the Fund may call\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the Fund's economic interest in the\ninvestment is to be voted upon. Security loans\nmay be terminated at any time by the Fund.\nAdditional Risk Information The following\nsection provides information regarding the\nprincipal risks identified under \u201cPrincipal\nRisks of Investing in the Fund\u201d in the Fund\nSummary along with additional risk\ninformation. Principal Risks Below Investment-\nGrade Securities Risk . Securities rated below\ninvestment-grade and unrated securities of\ncomparable credit quality (commonly known as\n\u201chigh-yield bonds\u201d or \u201cjunk bonds\u201d) lack\nstrong investment-grade characteristics, are\nconsidered predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the issuer's continuing ability to\nmake principal and interest payments, and are\nsubject to greater levels of credit, liquidity\nand market risk than higher-rated securities.\nThey can involve a substantially greater risk\nof default than higher-rated securities, and\ntheir values can decline significantly over\nshort periods of time. Issuers of lower-\nquality debt securities may have substantially\ngreater risk of insolvency or bankruptcy than\nissuers of higher-quality debt securities. In\nthe event the issuer of a debt security held\nby the Fund defaults on its payments or\nbecomes insolvent or bankrupt, the Fund may\nnot receive the return it was promised on the\ninvestment and could lose its entire\ninvestment. The lower ratings of junk bonds\nreflect a greater possibility that actual or\nperceived adverse changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuer or in general economic\nconditions, or an unanticipated rise in\ninterest rates, may impair the ability of the\nissuer to make payments of interest and\nprincipal. If this were to occur, the values\nof such securities held by the Fund may fall\nsubstantially and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the value of its investment. Lower-\nquality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or\nthe market or economy in general, than higher\nquality debt securities. The market for lower\nquality debt securities can be less liquid\nthan for higher quality debt securities,\nespecially during periods of recession or\ngeneral market decline, which could make it\ndifficult at times for the Fund to sell\ncertain securities at prices used in\ncalculating the Fund's net asset value. These\nsecurities may have significant volatility.\nCall/Prepayment Risk . Call/prepayment risk is\nthe risk that an issuer will exercise its\nright to pay principal on an obligation held\nby the Fund earlier than expected or required.\nThis may occur, for example, when there is a\ndecline in interest rates, and an issuer of\nbonds or preferred stock redeems the bonds or\nstock in order to replace them with\nobligations on which it is required to pay a\nlower interest or dividend rate. It may also\noccur when there is an unanticipated increase\nin the rate at which mortgages or other\nreceivables underlying mortgage- or asset-\nbacked securities held by the Fund are\nprepaid. In any such case, the Fund may be\nforced to invest the prepaid amounts in lower-\nyielding investments, resulting in a decline\nin the Fund's income. Counterparty Risk . The\nFund will be subject to credit risk with\nrespect to the counterparties with which the\nFund enters into derivatives contracts and\nother transactions such as repurchase\nagreements or reverse repurchase agreements.\nThe Fund's ability to profit from these types\nof investments and transactions will depend on\nthe willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund may be unable to\nterminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. The Fund may experience\nsignificant delays in obtaining any recovery\nin an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any\ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in\nsuch circumstances. If the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by its counterparty, it may\nbe delayed or prevented from realizing on the\ncollateral in the event of a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if the Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another 8 Table of Contents\ninstitution being substituted for that\nfinancial institution without the consent of\nthe Fund. Further, the Fund may be subject to\n\u201cbail-in\u201d risk under applicable law whereby,\nif required by the financial institution's\nauthority, the financial institution's\nliabilities could be written down, eliminated\nor converted into equity or an alternative\ninstrument of ownership. A bail-in of a\nfinancial institution may result in a\nreduction in value of some or all of its\nsecurities and, if the Fund holds such\nsecurities or has entered into a transaction\nwith such a financial security when a bail-in\noccurs, the Fund may also be similarly\nimpacted. Credit Risk . Credit risk is the\nrisk that an issuer, guarantor or liquidity\nprovider of a fixed-income security held by\nthe Fund may be unable or unwilling, or may be\nperceived (whether by market participants,\nratings agencies, pricing services or\notherwise) as unable or unwilling, to make\ntimely principal and/or interest payments, or\nto otherwise honor its obligations. It\nincludes the risk that the security will be\ndowngraded by a credit rating agency;\ngenerally, lower credit quality issuers\npresent higher credit risks. An actual or\nperceived decline in creditworthiness of an\nissuer of a fixed-income security held by the\nFund may result in a decrease in the value of\nthe security. It is possible that the ability\nof an issuer to meet its obligations will\ndecline substantially during the period when\nthe Fund owns securities of the issuer or that\nthe issuer will default on its obligations or\nthat the obligations of the issuer will be\nlimited or restructured. The credit rating\nassigned to any particular investment does not\nnecessarily reflect the issuer's current\nfinancial condition and does not reflect an\nassessment of an investment's volatility or\nliquidity. Securities rated in the lowest\ncategory of investment-grade are considered to\nhave speculative characteristics. If a\nsecurity held by the Fund loses its rating or\nits rating is downgraded, the Fund may\nnonetheless continue to hold the security in\nthe discretion of the Adviser. In the case of\nasset-backed or mortgage-related securities,\nchanges in the actual or perceived ability of\nthe obligors on the underlying assets or\nmortgages to make payments of interest and/or\nprincipal may affect the values of those\nsecurities. Debt Securities Risk . The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, a\ndecline in the Fund's income and yield, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Derivatives Risk. A derivative is\na financial contract the value of which\ndepends on, or is derived from, the value of\nan underlying asset, interest rate, or index.\nDerivative transactions typically involve\nleverage and may have significant volatility.\nIt is possible that a derivative transaction\nwill result in a loss greater than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may\nnot be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price.\nRisks associated with derivative instruments\ninclude potential changes in value in response\nto interest rate changes or other market\ndevelopments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential\nfor the derivative transaction not to have the\neffect the Adviser anticipated or a different\nor less favorable effect than the Adviser\nanticipated; the failure of the counterparty\nto the derivative transaction to perform its\nobligations under the transaction or to settle\na trade; possible mispricing or improper\nvaluation of the derivative instrument;\nimperfect correlation in the value of a\nderivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that the\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that the Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative 9 Table of Contents instrument,\nincluding without limitation absence of a\nsecondary trading market; the potential for\nreduced returns to the Fund due to losses on\nthe transaction and an increase in volatility;\nthe potential for the derivative transaction\nto have the effect of accelerating the\nrecognition of gain; and legal risks arising\nfrom the documentation relating to the\nderivative transaction. Futures Contract Risk;\nOther Exchange-Traded Derivatives Risk . The\nrisk of loss relating to the use of futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives is potentially unlimited. The\nability to establish and close out positions\nin futures contracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives will be subject to the development\nand maintenance of a liquid secondary market.\nThere is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any\nparticular futures contract or other exchange-\ntraded derivative or at any particular time.\nIn the event no such market exists for a\nparticular derivative, it might not be\npossible to effect closing transactions, and\nthe Fund will be unable to terminate the\nderivative. In using futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives, the Fund\nwill be reliant on the ability of the Adviser\nto predict market and price movements\ncorrectly; the skills needed to use such\nderivatives successfully are different from\nthose needed for traditional portfolio\nmanagement. If the Fund uses futures contracts\nor other exchange-traded derivatives for\nhedging purposes, there is a risk of imperfect\ncorrelation between movements in the prices of\nthe derivatives and movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying the derivatives\nor movements in the prices of the Fund's\ninvestments that are the subject of such\nhedge. The prices of futures and other\nexchange-traded derivatives, for a number of\nreasons, may not correlate perfectly with\nmovements in the securities or index\nunderlying them. For example, participants in\nthe futures markets and in markets for other\nexchange-traded derivatives are subject to\nmargin deposit requirements. Such requirements\nmay cause investors to take actions with\nrespect to their derivatives positions that\nthey would not otherwise take. The margin\nrequirements in the derivatives markets may be\nless onerous than margin requirements in the\nsecurities markets in general, and as a result\nthose markets may attract more speculators\nthan the securities markets do. Increased\nparticipation by speculators in those markets\nmay cause temporary price distortions. Due to\nthe possibility of price distortion, even a\ncorrect forecast of general market trends by\nthe Adviser still may not result in a\nsuccessful derivatives activity over a very\nshort time period. The risk of a position in a\nfutures contract or other exchange-traded\nderivative may be very large compared to the\nrelatively low level of margin the Fund is\nrequired to deposit. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its exchange-traded\nderivatives transactions. The Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with\nits transactions in futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives. In the\nevent of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, the\nFund may not be able to recover all (or any)\nof the margin it has posted with the futures\ncommission merchant, or to realize the value\nof any increase in the price of its positions,\nor it may experience a significant delay in\ndoing so. The Fund also may be delayed or\nprevented from recovering margin or other\namounts deposited with a futures commission\nmerchant or futures clearinghouse. The\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the\n\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have\nestablished limits referred to as \u201cspeculative\nposition limits\u201d on the maximum net long or\nnet short positions that any person and\ncertain affiliated entities may hold or\ncontrol in a particular futures contract.\nTrading limits are imposed on the number of\ncontracts that any person may trade on a\nparticular trading day. An exchange may order\nthe liquidation of positions found to be in\nviolation of these limits and it may impose\nsanctions or restrictions. In addition, the\nDodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to establish\nspeculative position limits on certain\ncommodity futures contracts and their\neconomically equivalent futures, options and\nswaps. Regulatory action taken by the CFTC to\nestablish these additional position limits may\nadversely affect the market liquidity of the\nfutures, options and economically equivalent\nderivatives in which the Fund may invest. It\nis possible that, as a result of such limits,\nthe Fund's Adviser will be precluded from\ntaking positions in certain futures contracts\nor over-the-counter derivatives as a result of\npositions held by other clients of the Adviser\nor by the Adviser or its affiliates\nthemselves. Futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives traded on markets\noutside the U.S. are not generally subject to\nthe same level of regulation by the CFTC or\nother U.S. regulatory entities as contracts\ntraded in the U.S., including without\nlimitation as to the execution, delivery, and\nclearing of transactions. U.S. regulators\nneither regulate the activities of a foreign\nexchange, nor have the power to compel\nenforcement of the rules of the foreign\nexchange or the laws of the foreign country in\nquestion. Margin and other payments made by\nthe Fund may not be afforded the same\nprotections as are afforded those payments in\nthe U.S., including in connection with the 10\n\nTable of Contents insolvency of an executing\nor clearing broker or a clearinghouse or\nexchange. Certain foreign futures contracts\nand other exchange-traded derivatives may be\nless liquid and more volatile than U.S.\ncontracts. Swaps Risk. A swap is a two-party\ncontract that generally obligates one party to\npay the positive return and the other party to\npay the negative return on a specified\nreference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment\nin securities, because swaps may be leveraged\nand are subject to counterparty risk (e.g. ,\nthe risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and\npricing risk (i.e. , swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). Swaps may also be considered illiquid.\nIt may not be possible for the Fund to\nliquidate a swap position at an advantageous\ntime or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Emerging Markets Risk . Investments in\nemerging markets are generally subject to a\ngreater risk of loss than investments in\ndeveloped markets. This may be due to, among\nother things, the possibility of greater\nmarket volatility, lower trading volume and\nliquidity, greater risk of expropriation,\nnationalization, and social, political and\neconomic instability, greater reliance on a\nfew industries, international trade or revenue\nfrom particular commodities, less developed\naccounting, legal and regulatory systems,\nhigher levels of inflation, deflation or\ncurrency devaluation, greater risk of market\nshut down, and more significant governmental\nlimitations on investment policy as compared\nto those typically found in a developed\nmarket. There may be limited legal rights and\nremedies for investors in companies domiciled\nin emerging markets. In addition, issuers\n(including governments) in emerging market\ncountries may have less financial stability\nthan in other countries. The securities of\nemerging market companies may trade less\nfrequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Market disruptions or\nsubstantial market corrections may limit very\nsignificantly the liquidity of securities of\ncertain companies in a particular country or\ngeographic region, or of all companies in the\ncountry or region. The Fund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions in such securities at\nany time, or at a favorable price, in order to\nmeet the Fund's obligations. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as\nembargo and acts of war. As a result, there\nwill tend to be an increased risk of price\nvolatility in investments in emerging market\ncountries, which may be magnified by currency\nfluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar.\nSettlement and asset custody practices for\ntransactions in emerging markets may differ\nfrom those in developed markets. Such\ndifferences may include possible delays in\nsettlement and certain settlement practices,\nsuch as delivery of securities prior to\nreceipt of payment, which increase the\nlikelihood of a \u201cfailed settlement.\u201d Failed\nsettlements can result in losses. For these\nand other reasons, investments in emerging\nmarkets are often considered speculative.\nExtension Risk. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, the average life of certain\ntypes of securities may be extended because of\nslower-than-expected principal payments. This\nmay increase the period of time during which\nan investment earns a below-market interest\nrate, increase the security's duration and\nreduce the value of the security. Extension\nrisk may be heightened during periods of\nadverse economic conditions generally, as\npayment rates decline due to higher\nunemployment levels and other factors.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk . The net asset value of\nFund Shares will generally fluctuate with\nchanges in the market value of the Fund's\nsecurities holdings. The market prices of Fund\nShares will generally fluctuate in accordance\nwith changes in the Fund's net asset value and\nsupply and demand of Fund Shares on the\nExchange. It cannot be predicted whether Fund\nShares will trade below, at or above their net\nasset value. Price differences may be due, in\nlarge part, to the fact that supply and demand\nforces at work in the secondary trading market\nfor Fund Shares will be closely related to,\nbut not identical to, the same forces\ninfluencing the prices of the securities of\nthe Index trading individually or in the\naggregate at any point in time. The market\nprices of Fund Shares may deviate\nsignificantly from the net asset value of Fund\nShares during periods of market volatility.\nHowever, given that Fund Shares can be created\nand redeemed in Creation Units (unlike shares\nof many closed-end funds, which frequently\ntrade at appreciable discounts from, and\nsometimes at premiums to, their net asset\nvalue), the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to the\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from the Fund's net asset value.\nIf an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a\ntime when the market price is at a discount to\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, then the\ninvestor may sustain losses. 11 Table of\nContents Income Risk. The Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling interest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of securities held by the\nFund may call or redeem the securities during\nperiods of falling interest rates, and the\nFund would likely be required to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower interest rates. If an\nobligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in\nother obligations paying income at lower\nrates. A reduction in the income earned by the\nFund may limit the Fund's ability to achieve\nits objective. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk . The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities. The Fund will seek to replicate\nIndex returns, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. The Fund generally will buy and will\nnot sell a security included in the Index as\nlong as the security is part of the Index\nregardless of any sudden or material decline\nin value or foreseeable material decline in\nvalue of the security, even though the Adviser\nmay make a different investment decision for\nother actively managed accounts or portfolios\nthat hold the security. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio managed using an active\ninvestment strategy. The structure and\ncomposition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index\n(in absolute terms and by comparison with\nother indices) and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. While the\nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex (i.e., achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index for a\nnumber of reasons. For example, the return on\nthe sample of securities purchased by the Fund\n(or the return on securities not included in\nthe Index) to replicate the performance of the\nIndex may not correlate precisely with the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, either as a result of\ncash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves\nof cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may attempt to track the Index\nreturn by investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the\nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes\nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact the Fund's\nability to match the return of the Index. The\nAdviser may apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or\ninvestment techniques to refine or limit the\nnumber or types of issuers included in the\nIndex in which the Fund may invest.\nApplication of such screens or techniques may\nresult in investment performance below that of\nthe Index and may not produce results expected\nby the Adviser. Index tracking risk may be\nheightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nPursuant to the Index methodology, a security\nmay be removed from the Index in the event\nthat it does not comply with the eligibility\nrequirements of the Index. As a result, the\nFund may be forced to sell securities at\ninopportune times and/or unfavorable prices\ndue to these changes in the Index components.\nWhen there are changes made to the component\nsecurities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio to\nattempt to increase the correlation between\nthe Fund's portfolio and the Index, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnscheduled changes to the Index may expose\nthe Fund to additional tracking error risk.\nThe Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities\nholdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its\nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income\ntax consequences. Interest Rate Risk .\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the\nsecurities held by the Fund will decline in\nvalue because of increases in market interest\nrates. Duration is a measure used to determine\nthe sensitivity of a security's price to\nchanges in interest rates. Debt securities\nwith longer durations tend to be more\nsensitive to changes in interest rates,\nusually making them more volatile than debt\nsecurities with shorter durations. For\nexample, the value of a security with a\nduration of five years would be expected to\ndecrease by 5% for every 1% increase in\ninterest rates. Falling interest rates also\ncreate the potential for a decline in the\nFund's income and yield. Interest-only and\nprincipal-only securities are especially\nsensitive to interest rate changes, which can\naffect not only their prices but can also\nchange the income flows and repayment\nassumptions about those investments. Variable\nand floating rate securities also generally\nincrease or decrease in value in response to\nchanges in interest rates, although generally\nto a lesser degree than fixed-rate securities.\nA substantial increase in interest rates may\nalso have an adverse impact on the liquidity\nof a security, especially those with longer\ndurations. Interest rate changes can be sudden\nand unpredictable, and are influenced by a\nnumber of factors, including government\npolicy, monetary policy, inflation\nexpectations, perceptions of 12 Table of\nContents risk, and supply and demand for\nbonds. Changes in government or central bank\npolicy, including changes in tax policy or\nchanges in a central bank's implementation of\nspecific policy goals, may have a substantial\nimpact on interest rates. This could lead to\nheightened levels of interest rate, volatility\nand liquidity risks for the fixed income\nmarkets generally and could have a substantial\nand immediate effect on the values of the\nFund's investments. There can be no guarantee\nthat any particular government or central bank\npolicy will be continued, discontinued or\nchanged, nor that any such policy will have\nthe desired effect on interest rates.\nLeveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,\nreverse repurchase agreements, certain\nderivatives transactions, securities lending\ntransactions and other investment transactions\nsuch as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or\nforward commitment transactions may create\ninvestment leverage. If the Fund engages in\ntransactions that have a leveraging effect on\nthe Fund's investment portfolio, the value of\nthe Fund will be potentially more volatile and\nall other risks will tend to be compounded.\nThis is because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than the Fund would otherwise have\nand so magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses to the Fund. Certain\nderivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause the\nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to\nmeet asset segregation or coverage\nrequirements. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk\nis the risk that the Fund may not be able to\ndispose of securities or close out derivatives\ntransactions readily at a favorable time or\nprices (or at all) or at prices approximating\nthose at which the Fund currently values them.\nFor example, certain investments may be\nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade\nin the over-the-counter market or in limited\nvolume, or may not have an active trading\nmarket. Illiquid securities may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for the Fund to value illiquid\nsecurities accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. Disposal of illiquid\nsecurities may entail registration expenses\nand other transaction costs that are higher\nthan those for liquid securities. The Fund may\nseek to borrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of\nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing\nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund.\nMarket Risk . Market prices of investments\nheld by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes\nrapidly or unpredictably. The Fund's\ninvestments are subject to changes in general\neconomic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in\ninvestment in securities markets. Investment\nmarkets can be volatile, and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in\ninterest rates, changes in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in\nthe Fund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities\nprices. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. An outbreak of a respiratory\ndisease caused by a novel coronavirus (known\nas COVID-19) first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has resulted in a global\npandemic and major disruptions to economies\nand markets around the world, including the\nUnited States. Financial markets experienced\nand may continue to experience extreme\nvolatility and severe losses, and trading in\nmany instruments was and may continue to be\ndisrupted as a result. Liquidity for many\ninstruments was and may continue to be greatly\nreduced for periods of time. Some interest\nrates are very low and in some cases yields\nare negative. Governments and central banks,\nincluding the Federal Reserve in the United\nStates, have taken extraordinary and\nunprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.\nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some\ntime. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19,\nand measures taken to mitigate its effects,\ncould result in disruptions to the services\nprovided to the Fund by its service providers.\n13 Table of Contents New Fund Risk . The Fund\nis new and there is no assurance that the Fund\nwill grow quickly. When the Fund's size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume, which could lead to wider bid/ask\nspreads. In addition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if the Fund does not\nmeet certain conditions of the listing\nexchange. Any resulting liquidation of the\nFund could cause elevated transaction costs\nfor the Fund and negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Non-Diversification Risk .\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold\na smaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may\naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund\nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Non-U.S. Securities Risk .\nInvestments in securities of non-U.S. issuers\nentail risks not typically associated with\ninvesting in securities of U.S. issuers.\nSimilar risks may apply to securities traded\non a U.S. securities exchange that are issued\nby entities with significant exposure to\nnon-U.S. countries. In certain countries,\nlegal remedies available to investors may be\nmore limited than those available with regard\nto U.S. investments. Because non-U.S.\nsecurities are typically denominated and\ntraded in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar, the value of the Fund's assets, to the\nextent they are non-U.S. dollar-denominated,\nmay be affected favorably or unfavorably by\ncurrency exchange rates, exchange control\nregulations, and restrictions or prohibitions\non the repatriation of non-U.S. currencies. To\nthe extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are\nclosed when the exchange on which the Fund's\nshares trade is open, there may be deviations\nbetween the current price of an underlying\nsecurity and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign\nmarket. These deviations could result in the\nFund experiencing premiums or discounts\ngreater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Income and gains with\nrespect to investments in certain countries\nmay be subject to withholding and other taxes.\nThere may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to accounting, auditing, and\nfinancial reporting standards, regulatory\nframework and practices comparable to those in\nthe United States. The securities of some\nnon-U.S. entities are less liquid and at times\nmore volatile than securities of comparable\nU.S. entities, and could become subject to\nsanctions or embargoes that adversely affect\nthe Fund's investment. Non-U.S. transaction\ncosts, such as brokerage commissions and\ncustody costs may be higher than in the U.S.\nIn addition, there may be a possibility of\nnationalization or expropriation of assets,\nimposition of currency exchange controls,\nconfiscatory taxation, and diplomatic\ndevelopments that could adversely affect the\nvalues of the Fund's investments in certain\nnon-U.S. countries. Investments in securities\nof non-U.S. issuers also are subject to\nforeign political and economic risk not\nassociated with U.S. investments, meaning that\npolitical events (civil unrest, national\nelections, changes in political conditions and\nforeign relations, imposition of exchange\ncontrols and repatriation restrictions),\nsocial and economic events (labor strikes,\nrising inflation) and natural disasters\noccurring in a country where the Fund invests\ncould cause the Fund's investments in that\ncountry to experience gains or losses. Certain\ncountries have recently experienced (or\ncurrently are expected to experience) negative\ninterest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate\nconditions may be experienced in other\nregions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify the Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and\nperformance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Reinvestment Risk. Income from the\nFund's portfolio may decline when the Fund\ninvests the proceeds from investment income,\nsales of portfolio securities or matured,\ntraded or called debt obligations. For\ninstance, during periods of declining interest\nrates, an issuer of debt obligations may\nexercise an option to redeem securities prior\nto maturity, forcing the Fund to reinvest the\nproceeds in lower-yielding securities. A\ndecline in income received by the Fund from\nits investments is likely to have a negative\neffect on the yield and total return of the\nFund Shares. Restricted Securities Risk . The\nFund may hold securities that have not been\nregistered for sale to the public under the\nU.S. federal securities laws pursuant to an\nexemption from registration. These securities\nmay be less liquid than securities registered\nfor sale to the general public. The liquidity\nof a restricted security may be affected by a\nnumber of factors, including, among others:\n(i) the creditworthiness of the issuer; (ii)\nthe frequency of trades and quotes for the\nsecurity; (iii) the number of dealers willing\nto purchase or sell the security and the\nnumber of other potential purchasers; (iv)\ndealer undertakings to make a market in the\nsecurity; (v) the nature of any legal\nrestrictions governing 14 Table of Contents\ntrading in the security; and (vi) the nature\nof the security and the nature of marketplace\ntrades. There can be no assurance that a\nliquid trading market will exist at any time\nfor any particular restricted security. Also,\nrestricted securities may be difficult to\nvalue because market quotations may not be\nreadily available, and the securities may have\nsignificant volatility. Settlement Risk .\nMarkets in different countries have different\nclearance and settlement procedures and in\ncertain markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of transactions. Delays in\nsettlement may increase credit risk to the\nFund, limit the ability of the Fund to\nreinvest the proceeds of a sale of securities,\nhinder the ability of the Fund to lend its\nportfolio securities, and potentially subject\nthe Fund to penalties for its failure to\ndeliver to on-purchasers of securities whose\ndelivery to the Fund was delayed. Delays in\nthe settlement of securities purchased by the\nFund may limit the ability of the Fund to sell\nthose securities at times and prices it\nconsiders desirable, and may subject the Fund\nto losses and costs due to its own inability\nto settle with subsequent purchasers of the\nsecurities from it. The Fund may be required\nto borrow monies it had otherwise expected to\nreceive in connection with the settlement of\nsecurities sold by it, in order to meet its\nobligations to others. Limits on the ability\nof the Fund to purchase or sell securities due\nto settlement delays could increase any\nvariance between the Fund's performance and\nthat of its benchmark index. Sovereign Debt\nObligations Risk . Investments in debt\nsecurities issued by governments or by\ngovernment agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental\nentities responsible for repayment may be\nunable or unwilling to pay interest and repay\nprincipal when due. A governmental entity's\nwillingness or ability to pay interest and\nrepay principal in a timely manner may be\naffected by a variety of factors, including\nits cash flow, the size of its reserves, its\naccess to foreign exchange, the relative size\nof its debt service burden to its economy as a\nwhole, and political constraints. A\ngovernmental entity may default on its\nobligations or may require renegotiation or\nreschedule of debt payments. Any restructuring\nof a sovereign debt obligation held by the\nFund will likely have a significant adverse\neffect on the value of the obligation. In the\nevent of default of sovereign debt, the Fund\nmay be unable to pursue legal action against\nthe sovereign issuer or to realize on\ncollateral securing the debt. The sovereign\ndebt of many non-U.S. governments, including\ntheir sub-divisions and instrumentalities, is\nrated below investment-grade. Sovereign debt\nrisk may be greater for debt securities issued\nor guaranteed by emerging and/or frontier\ncountries. Valuation Risk . Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. Technological issues or other service\ndisruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause the Fund to value\nits investments incorrectly. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the\nvalue established for it at any time, and it\nis possible that the Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby the Fund at that time. Non-Principal Risks\nAuthorized Participants, Market Makers and\nLiquidity Providers Concentration Risk. The\nFund has a limited number of financial\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are responsible\nfor the creation and redemption activity for\nthe Fund. In addition, there may be a limited\nnumber of market makers and/or liquidity\nproviders in the marketplace. To the extent\neither of the following events occur, Fund\nShares may trade at a material discount to NAV\nand possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit the\nbusiness or otherwise become unable to process\ncreation and/or redemption orders and no other\nAPs step forward to perform these services, or\n(ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers\nexit the business or significantly reduce\ntheir business activities and no other\nentities step forward to perform their\nfunctions. Cash Transaction Risk . To the\nextent the Fund sells portfolio securities to\nmeet some or all of a redemption request with\ncash, the Fund may incur taxable gains or\nlosses that it might not have incurred had it\nmade redemptions entirely in-kind. As a\nresult, the Fund may pay out higher annual\ncapital gain distributions than if the in-kind\nredemption process was used. 15 Table of\nContents Concentration Risk . The Fund's\nassets may be concentrated in an industry or\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent\nthat the Fund's underlying Index concentrates\nin a particular industry or group of\nindustries. When the Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or\nsector, financial, economic, business, and\nother developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have\na greater effect on the Fund than if it had\nnot focused its assets in that industry,\nmarket, or economic sector, which may increase\nthe volatility of the Fund. Conflicts of\nInterest Risk. An investment in the Fund will\nbe subject to a number of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest. For example, the\nAdviser or its affiliates may provide services\nto the Fund, such as securities lending agency\nservices, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer\nagency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for\nwhich the Fund would compensate the Adviser\nand/or such affiliates. The Fund may invest in\nother pooled investment vehicles sponsored,\nmanaged, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which the Fund pays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of the\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements. The Adviser and its\naffiliates serve as investment adviser to\nother clients and may make investment\ndecisions that may be different from those\nthat will be made by the Adviser on behalf of\nthe Fund. For example, the Adviser may provide\nasset allocation advice to some clients that\nmay include a recommendation to invest in or\nredeem from particular issuers while not\nproviding that same recommendation to all\nclients invested in the same or similar\nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to\npurchase (or sell) investments for the Fund\nand to sell (or purchase) the same investment\nfor accounts, funds, or structured products\nfor which it serves as asset manager, or for\nother clients or affiliates. The Adviser and\nits affiliates may invest for clients in\nvarious securities that are senior, pari\npassuor junior to, or have interests different\nfrom or adverse to, the securities that are\nowned by the Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material\nnonpublic confidential information that may\nrestrict the Adviser from purchasing\nsecurities or selling securities for itself or\nits clients (including the Fund) or otherwise\nusing such information for the benefit of its\nclients or itself. The foregoing does not\npurport to be a comprehensive list or complete\nexplanation of all potential conflicts of\ninterests which may affect the Fund. The Fund\nmay encounter circumstances, or enter into\ntransactions, in which conflicts of interest\nthat are not listed or discussed above may\narise. Costs of Buying and Selling Shares .\nInvestors buying or selling Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market will pay brokerage\ncommissions or other charges imposed by\nbrokers, as determined by that broker.\nBrokerage commissions are often a fixed amount\nand may be a significant proportional cost for\ninvestors seeking to buy or sell relatively\nsmall amounts of Fund Shares. In addition,\nsecondary market investors will also incur the\ncost of the difference between the price that\nan investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares\n(the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which an\ninvestor is willing to sell Fund Shares (the\n\u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask\nprices is often referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or\n\u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies\nover time for Fund Shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and is generally\nlower if Fund Shares have more trading volume\nand market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares\nhave little trading volume and market\nliquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask\nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,\nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may\nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, funds (such as the Fund) and their\nservice providers (including the Adviser) may\nbe prone to operational and information\nsecurity risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. In general,\ncyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects.\nCyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from\naccessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns of, the Fund, the\nAdviser or a custodian, transfer agent, or\nother affiliated or third-party service\nprovider may adversely affect the Fund or its\nshareholders. For instance, cyber-attacks or\ntechnical malfunctions may interfere with the\nprocessing of shareholder or 16 Table of\nContents other transactions, affect the Fund's\nability to calculate its NAV, cause the\nrelease of private shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject the\nFund to regulatory fines, penalties or\nfinancial losses, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and additional compliance\ncosts. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions\nmay render records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund\nShares, and other data integral to the\nfunctioning of the Fund inaccessible or\ninaccurate or incomplete. The Fund may also\nincur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents\nin the future. The Fund and its shareholders\ncould be negatively impacted as a result.\nWhile the Adviser has established a business\ncontinuity plan and systems designed to\nminimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the\nuse of technology, processes and controls,\nthere are inherent limitations in such plans\nand systems, including the possibility that\ncertain risks have not been identified, given\nthe evolving nature of this threat. The Fund\nrelies on third-party service providers for\nmany of its day-to-day operations, and will be\nsubject to the risk that the protections and\nprotocols implemented by those service\nproviders will be ineffective to protect the\nFund from cyber-attack. The Adviser does not\ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems\nput in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may\nhave limited indemnification obligations to\nthe Adviser or the Fund. Similar types of\ncybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions\nalso are present for issuers of securities in\nwhich the Fund invests, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such\nissuers, and may cause the Fund's investment\nin such securities to lose value. Index\nConstruction Risk . A security included in the\nIndex may not exhibit the characteristic or\nprovide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently the Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that\ncharacteristic or exposure. Index Licensing\nRisk . It is possible that the license under\nwhich the Adviser or the Fund is permitted to\nreplicate or otherwise use the Index will be\nterminated or may be disputed, impaired or\ncease to remain in effect. In such a case, the\nAdviser may be required to replace the Index\nwith another index which it considers to be\nappropriate in light of the investment\nstrategy of the Fund. The use of any such\nsubstitute index may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's performance. In the event that the\nAdviser is unable to identify a suitable\nreplacement for the Index, it may determine to\nterminate the Fund. Money Market Risk . An\ninvestment in a money market fund is not a\ndeposit of any bank and is not insured or\nguaranteed by the FDIC or any other government\nagency. Certain money market funds seek to\npreserve the value of their shares at $1.00\nper share, although there can be no assurance\nthat they will do so, and it is possible to\nlose money by investing in such a money market\nfund. A major or unexpected change in interest\nrates or a decline in the credit quality of an\nissuer or entity providing credit support, an\ninactive trading market for money market\ninstruments, or adverse market, economic,\nindustry, political, regulatory, geopolitical,\nand other conditions could cause the share\nprice of such a money market fund to fall\nbelow $1.00. It is possible that such a money\nmarket fund will issue and redeem shares at\n$1.00 per share at times when the fair value\nof the money market fund's portfolio per share\nis more or less than $1.00. None of State\nStreet Corporation, State Street Bank and\nTrust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d), State Street\nGlobal Advisors, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or\ntheir affiliates (\u201cState Street Entities\u201d)\nguarantee the value of an investment in a\nmoney market fund at $1.00 per share.\nInvestors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market\nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV\nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the\nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or\nless than their original purchase price.\nRecent changes in the regulation of money\nmarket funds may affect the operations and\nstructures of money market funds. A money\nmarket fund may be permitted or required to\nimpose redemption fees or to impose\nlimitations on redemptions during periods of\nhigh illiquidity in the markets for the\ninvestments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . The Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to the Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nmay have the effect of reducing the Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. The Fund may engage in frequent\ntrading of its portfolio securities in\nconnection with Index rebalancing. Frequent\ntrading may cause the Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent trading. 17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend\nportfolio securities in an amount not to\nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the\nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by the\nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a\nloan transaction, as compensation for lending\nits securities, the Fund will receive a\nportion of the dividends or interest accrued\non the securities held as collateral or, in\nthe case of cash collateral, a portion of the\nincome from the investment of such cash. In\naddition, the Fund will receive the amount of\nall dividends, interest and other\ndistributions on the loaned securities.\nHowever, the borrower has the right to vote\nthe loaned securities. The Fund will call\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the investment is to be voted upon.\nEfforts to recall such securities promptly may\nbe unsuccessful, especially for foreign\nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and\nmay involve expenses to the Fund. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. Should the borrower\nof the securities fail financially, the Fund\nmay experience delays in recovering the\nsecurities or exercising its rights in the\ncollateral. Loans are made only to borrowers\nthat are deemed by the securities lending\nagent to be of good financial standing. In a\nloan transaction, the Fund will also bear the\nrisk of any decline in value of securities\nprovided as collateral or acquired with cash\ncollateral. The Fund will attempt to minimize\nthis risk by limiting the investment of cash\ncollateral to high quality instruments of\nshort maturity either directly on behalf of\nthe lending Fund or through one or more joint\naccounts or funds, which may include those\nmanaged by the Adviser. To the extent the\ncollateral provided or investments made with\ncash collateral differ from securities\nincluded in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss\nthan the securities included in the Index. In\naddition, the Fund will be subject to the risk\nthat any income generated by lending its\nsecurities or reinvesting cash collateral is\nlower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay\na borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute\npayments for dividends when overseeing the\nFund's securities lending activity. Trading\nIssues . Although Fund Shares are listed for\ntrading on the Exchange and may be listed or\ntraded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges\nother than the Exchange, there can be no\nassurance that an active trading market for\nthe Fund Shares will develop or be maintained.\nTrading in Fund Shares on the Exchange may be\nhalted due to market conditions or for reasons\nthat, in the view of the Exchange, make\ntrading in Fund Shares inadvisable. In\naddition, trading in Fund Shares on the\nExchange is subject to trading halts caused by\nextraordinary market volatility pursuant to\nExchange \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d rules. Similar to\nthe shares of operating companies listed on a\nstock exchange, Fund Shares may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility in the trading price of\nthe Fund's shares. While the Fund expects that\nthe ability of Authorized Participants to\ncreate and redeem Fund Shares at net asset\nvalue should be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of the Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund and, subject to\nthe oversight of the Board, is responsible for\nthe investment management of the Fund.

The Adviser has contractually\nagreed to waive a portion of its management\nfee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount\nequal to any acquired fund fees and expenses\n(excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash\nmanagement purposes, if any) for the Fund\nuntil October 31, 2021. This waiver and/or\nreimbursement does not provide for the\nrecoupment by the Adviser of any amounts\nwaived or reimbursed. This waiver and/or\nreimbursement may not be terminated prior to\nOctober 31, 2021 except with the approval of\nthe Fund's Board of Trustees. The Adviser pays\nall expenses of the Fund other than the\nmanagement fee, brokerage expenses, taxes,\ninterest, fees and expenses of the Independent\nTrustees (including any Trustee's counsel\nfees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees\nand expenses and other extraordinary expenses.\nA summary of the factors considered by the\nBoard in connection with the initial approval\nof the Investment Advisory Agreement and Sub-\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund will be\navailable in the Fund's annual report for the\nperiod ended June 30, 2021. Investment Sub-\nAdviser . Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement\nbetween the Fund and the Adviser, the Adviser\nis authorized to engage one or more sub-\nadvisers for the performance of any of the\nservices contemplated to be rendered by the\nAdviser. The Adviser has retained SSGA LTD, as\nsub-adviser, to assist in the day to day\nmanagement of the Fund investments, subject to\nsupervision by the Adviser and oversight by\nthe Board. SSGA LTD has been operating since\n1990 with experience in managing indexed fixed\nincome portfolios. As of December 31, 2020,\nSSGA LTD managed approximately $423.65 billion\nin assets. SSGA LTD's principal business\naddress is 20 Churchill Place, Canary Wharf,\nLondon E14 5HJ, United Kingdom. In accordance\nwith the Sub-Advisory Agreement between the\nAdviser and SSGA LTD, the Adviser pays SSGA\nLTD 40% of the advisory fee paid by the Fund\nto the Adviser (after deducting payments to\nthe fund service providers and fund expenses).\nThe Fund is not responsible for the fees paid\nto SSGA LTD. SSGA FM, as the investment\nadviser for the Fund, may hire one or more\nsub-advisers to oversee the day-to-day\ninvestment activities of the Fund. The sub-\nadvisers are subject to oversight by the\nAdviser. The Adviser and SPDR Series Trust\n(the \u201cTrust\u201d) have received an exemptive order\nfrom the SEC that permits the Adviser, with\nthe approval of the Independent Trustees of\nthe Trust, to retain and amend existing sub-\nadvisory agreements with unaffiliated\ninvestment sub-advisers for the Fund without\nsubmitting the sub-advisory agreement to a\nvote of the Fund's shareholders. The Trust\nwill notify shareholders in the event of any\nchange in the identity of such sub-adviser or\nsub-advisers. The Adviser has ultimate\nresponsibility for the investment performance\nof the Fund due to its responsibility to\noversee each sub-adviser and recommend their\nhiring, termination and replacement. The\nAdviser is not required to disclose fees paid\nto any unaffiliated sub-adviser retained\npursuant to the order. Portfolio Managers.\nThe Fund is managed using a team of investment\nprofessionals. The team approach is used to\ncreate an environment that encourages the flow\nof investment ideas. The portfolio managers\nwithin the team work together in a cohesive\nmanner to develop and enhance techniques that\ndrive the investment process for the\ninvestment strategy. This approach requires\nportfolio managers to share a variety of\nresponsibilities including investment strategy\nand analysis while retaining responsibility\nfor the implementation of the strategy within\nany particular portfolio.

Additional\nPurchase and Sale Information Fund Shares are\nlisted for secondary trading on the Exchange\nand individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The\nExchange may close early on the business day\nbefore certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules\nare subject to change without notice. If you\nbuy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you will pay the secondary market\nprice for Fund Shares. In addition, you may\nincur customary brokerage commissions and\ncharges and may pay some or all of the spread\nbetween the bid and the offered price in the\nsecondary market on each leg of a round trip\n(purchase and sale) transaction. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares will fluctuate\ncontinuously throughout trading hours based on\nmarket supply and demand rather than the\nFund's net asset value, which is calculated at\nthe end of each business day. Fund Shares will\ntrade on the Exchange at prices that may be\nabove ( i.e., at a premium) or below ( i.e.,\nat a discount), to varying degrees, the daily\nnet asset value of Fund Shares. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares may deviate\nsignificantly from the Fund's net asset value\nduring periods of market volatility. Given,\nhowever, that Fund Shares can be issued and\nredeemed daily in Creation Units, the Adviser\nbelieves that large discounts and premiums to\nnet asset value should not be sustained over\nlong periods. The Exchange will disseminate,\nevery fifteen seconds during the regular\ntrading day, an indicative optimized portfolio\nvalue (\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to the Fund. The IOPV\ncalculations are estimates of the value of the\nFund's net asset value per Fund Share.\nPremiums and discounts between the IOPV and\nthe market price may occur. This should not be\nviewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net\nasset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is based\non the current market value of the published\nbasket of portfolio securities and/or cash\nrequired to be deposited in exchange for a\nCreation Unit and does not necessarily reflect\nthe precise composition of the Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. When applicable, the\nIOPV price is based on quotes and closing\nprices from the securities' local market\nconverted into U.S. dollars at the current\ncurrency rates and may not reflect events that\noccur subsequent to the local market's close.\nTherefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best\npossible valuation of the Fund's current\nportfolio. Neither the Fund nor the Adviser or\nany of their affiliates are involved in, or\nresponsible for, the calculation or\ndissemination of such IOPVs and make no\nwarranty as to their accuracy. The Fund does\nnot impose any restrictions on the frequency\nof purchases and redemptions; however, the\nFund reserves the right to reject or limit\npurchases at any time as described in the SAI.\nWhen considering that no restriction or policy\nwas necessary, the Board evaluated the risks\nposed by market timing activities, such as\nwhether frequent purchases and redemptions\nwould interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of the Fund's investment\nstrategy, or 22 Table of Contents whether they\nwould cause the Fund to experience increased\ntransaction costs. The Board considered that,\nunlike traditional mutual funds, Fund Shares\nare issued and redeemed only in large\nquantities of shares known as Creation Units,\navailable only from the Fund directly, and\nthat most trading in the Fund occurs on the\nExchange at prevailing market prices and does\nnot involve the Fund directly. Given this\nstructure, the Board determined that it is\nunlikely that (a) market timing would be\nattempted by the Fund's shareholders or (b)\nany attempts to market time the Fund by\nshareholders would result in negative impact\nto the Fund or its shareholders. Distributions\nDividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund\nshareholder, you are entitled to your share of\nthe Fund's income and net realized gains on\nits investments. The Fund pays out\nsubstantially all of its net earnings to its\nshareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d The Fund may\nearn interest from debt securities and, if\nparticipating, securities lending income. The\nFund will generally realize short-term capital\ngains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges\nassets held for one year or less. Net short-\nterm capital gains will generally be treated\nas ordinary income when distributed to\nshareholders. The Fund will generally realize\nlong-term capital gains or losses whenever it\nsells or exchanges assets held for more than\none year. Net capital gains (the excess of the\nFund's net long-term capital gains over its\nnet short-term capital losses) are distributed\nto shareholders as \u201ccapital gain\ndistributions.\u201d Income dividend distributions,\nif any, are generally distributed to\nshareholders monthly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Net\ncapital gains for the Fund are distributed at\nleast annually. Dividends may be declared and\npaid more frequently or at any other time to\nimprove Index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nDistributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares\nonly if the broker through whom you purchased\nFund Shares makes such option available.\nDistributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as\nif such distributions had not been reinvested.\nPortfolio Holdings Disclosure The Fund's\nportfolio holdings disclosure policy is\ndescribed in the SAI. In addition, the\nidentities and quantities of the securities\nheld by the Fund are disclosed on the Fund's\nwebsite. Additional Tax Information The\nfollowing discussion is a summary of some\nimportant U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in the Fund. Your investment in the\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes On Distributions.\nIn general, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in the\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from\nthe Fund will generally be taxed as ordinary\nincome. Any distributions of the Fund's net\ncapital gains are taxable as long-term capital\ngain regardless of how long you have owned\nFund Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders\nat rates of up to 20%. Distributions in excess\nof the Fund's current and accumulated earnings\nand profits are treated as a tax-free return\nof capital to the extent of your basis in the\nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital\ngain thereafter. Since the Fund primarily\nholds investments that do not pay dividends,\nit is not expected that a substantial portion\n(if any) of the dividends paid by the Fund\nwill qualify for either the dividends-received\ndeduction for corporations or the favorable\nincome tax rates available to individuals on\nqualified dividend income. U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding specified thresholds are\nsubject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on\nall or a portion of their \u201cnet investment\nincome,\u201d which includes taxable interest,\ndividends and certain capital gains (generally\nincluding capital gain distributions and\ncapital gains realized upon the sale of Fund\nShares). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or\na portion of the undistributed net investment\nincome of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. 23 Table of Contents\nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions\nwill be subject to a 1.4% tax on net\ninvestment income. For these purposes, certain\ndividends and capital gain distributions, and\ncertain gains from the disposition of Fund\nShares (among other categories of income), are\ngenerally taken into account in computing a\nshareholder's net investment income.\nDistributions paid in January, but declared by\nthe Fund in October, November or December of\nthe previous year, payable to shareholders of\nrecord in such a month, may be taxable to you\nin the calendar year in which they were\ndeclared. The Fund will inform you of the\namount of your ordinary income dividends and\ncapital gain distributions and any qualified\ndividend income shortly after the close of\neach calendar year. A distribution will reduce\nthe Fund's net asset value per Fund Share and\nmay be taxable to you as ordinary income or\ncapital gain even though, from an investment\nstandpoint, the distribution may constitute a\nreturn of capital. Original Issue Discount .\nInvestments by the Fund in zero coupon or\nother discount securities will result in\nincome to the Fund equal to a portion of the\nexcess face value of the securities over their\nissue price (the \u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or\n\u201cOID\u201d) each year that the securities are held,\neven though the Fund may receive no cash\ninterest payments or may receive cash interest\npayments that are less than the income\nrecognized for tax purposes. In other\ncircumstances, whether pursuant to the terms\nof a security or as a result of other factors\noutside the control of the Fund, the Fund may\nrecognize income without receiving a\ncommensurate amount of cash. The Fund\u2018s share\nof such income is included in determining the\namount that the Fund must distribute to\nmaintain its eligibility for treatment as a\nregulated investment company and to avoid the\npayment of federal tax, including the\nnondeductible 4% excise tax. Because any\nincome required to be recognized as a result\nof the OID and/or market discount rules\n(discussed below) may not be matched by a\ncorresponding cash payment, the Fund may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand eliminate taxes at the Fund level.\nInflation-Indexed Bonds. Special rules apply\nif the Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds.\nGenerally, all stated interest on inflation-\nindexed bonds is taken into income by the Fund\nunder its regular method of accounting for\ninterest income. The amount of any positive\ninflation adjustment for a taxable year, which\nresults from an increase in the inflation-\nadjusted principal amount of the bond, is\ntreated as OID. The amount of the Fund's OID\nin a taxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund's taxable income for such\nyear without a corresponding receipt of cash\nuntil the bond matures. As a result, the Fund\nmay need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for such\nyear. The amount of any negative inflation\nadjustments, which result from a decrease in\nthe inflation-adjusted principal amount of the\nbond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market\ndiscount, if any) otherwise includible in the\nFund's income with respect to the bond for the\ntaxable year; any remaining negative\nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary\nloss or, in certain circumstances, carried\nforward to reduce the amount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the\nbond in future taxable years. Market Discount.\nAny market discount recognized on a market\ndiscount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or below adjusted issue price if the\nbond was issued with original issue discount.\nAbsent an election by the Fund to include the\nmarket discount in income as it accrues, the\ngain on the Fund's disposition of such an\nobligation will be treated as ordinary income\nrather than capital gain to the extent of the\naccrued market discount. Where the income\nrequired to be recognized as a result of the\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash payment, the Fund may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand eliminate taxes at the Fund level,\npotentially resulting in additional taxable\ngain or loss to the Fund. Derivatives and\nOther Complex Securities. The Fund may invest\nin complex securities. These investments may\nbe subject to numerous special and complex\nrules. These rules could affect whether gains\nand losses recognized by the Fund are treated\nas ordinary income or capital gain, accelerate\nthe recognition of income to the Fund and/or\ndefer the Fund's ability to recognize losses.\nIn turn, these rules may affect the amount,\ntiming or character of the income distributed\nto you by the Fund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding the application\nof these rules. Foreign Currency Transactions.\nThe Fund's transactions in foreign currencies,\nforeign currency denominated debt obligations\nand certain foreign currency options, futures\ncontracts and forward contracts (and similar\ninstruments) may give rise to ordinary income\nor loss to the extent such income or loss\nresults from fluctuations in the value of the\nforeign currency concerned. 24 Table of\nContents Foreign Income Taxes. Investment\nincome received by the Fund from sources\nwithin foreign countries may be subject to\nforeign income taxes withheld at the source.\nThe United States has entered into tax\ntreaties with many foreign countries which may\nentitle the Fund to a reduced rate of such\ntaxes or exemption from taxes on such income.\nIt is impossible to determine the effective\nrate of foreign tax for the Fund in advance\nsince the amount of the assets to be invested\nwithin various countries is not known. If more\nthan 50% of the total assets of the Fund at\nthe close of its taxable year consist of\ncertain foreign stocks or securities, the Fund\nmay elect to \u201cpass through\u201d to you certain\nforeign income taxes (including withholding\ntaxes) paid by the Fund. If the Fund in which\nyou hold Fund Shares makes such an election,\nyou will be considered to have received as an\nadditional dividend your share of such foreign\ntaxes, but you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income, or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If the Fund does not so elect, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a deduction for\ncertain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund.\nUnder certain circumstances, if the Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign taxes paid in\nrespect of a prior year, the value of Fund\nShares could be affected or any foreign tax\ncredits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign\ntaxes for the current year could be reduced.\nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of\nFund Shares is generally treated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for more than one year and as short-term\ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for one year or less, except that any\ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held\nfor six months or less is treated as long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect to the Fund\nShares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of\nCreation Units. A person who exchanges\nsecurities for Creation Units generally will\nrecognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss\nwill be equal to the difference between the\nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time\nand the exchanger's aggregate basis in the\nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for\nthe Creation Units. A person who exchanges\nCreation Units for securities will generally\nrecognize a gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the exchanger's basis in\nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss\nrealized upon an exchange of securities for\nCreation Units cannot be deducted currently\nunder the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on\nthe basis that there has been no significant\nchange in economic position. Persons\nexchanging securities should consult their own\ntax advisor with respect to whether wash sale\nrules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. Under current federal tax laws,\nany capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Fund Shares (or securities\nsurrendered) have been held for more than one\nyear and as a short-term capital gain or loss\nif the Fund Shares (or securities surrendered)\nhave been held for one year or less. If you\ncreate or redeem Creation Units, you will be\nsent a confirmation statement showing how many\nFund Shares you purchased or sold and at what\nprice. The Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has\nthe right to reject an order for Creation\nUnits if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund and if,\npursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the Fund\nwould have a basis in the securities different\nfrom the market value of the securities on the\ndate of deposit. The Trust also has the right\nto require information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser\n(or group of purchasers) will not recognize\ngain or loss upon the exchange of securities\nfor Creation Units. If the Fund redeems\nCreation Units in cash, it may bear additional\ncosts and recognize more capital gains than it\nwould if it redeems Creation Units in-kind.\nNon-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income dividends\npaid by the Fund to shareholders who are non-\nresident aliens or foreign entities will\ngenerally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax (other than distributions reported by the\nFund as interest-related dividends and short-\nterm capital gain dividends), unless a lower\ntreaty rate applies or unless such income is\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, the Fund may report\ninterest-related 25 Table of Contents\ndividends to the extent of its net income\nderived from U.S. source interest, and the\nFund may report short-term capital gain\ndividends to the extent its net short-term\ncapital gain for the taxable year exceeds its\nnet long-term capital loss. Gains on the sale\nof Fund Shares and dividends that are, in each\ncase, effectively connected with the conduct\nof a trade or business within the U.S. will\ngenerally be subject to U.S. federal net\nincome taxation at regular income tax rates.\nNon-U.S. shareholders that own, directly or\nindirectly, more than 5% of the Fund's shares\nare urged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning special tax rules that may apply to\ntheir investment. Unless certain non-U.S.\nentities that hold Fund Shares comply with IRS\nrequirements that will generally require them\nto report information regarding U.S. persons\ninvesting in, or holding accounts with, such\nentities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to\ndistributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the\nwithholding described in this paragraph under\nan applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the\nterms of such agreement. Backup Withholding.\nThe Fund will be required in certain cases to\nwithhold (as \u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts\npayable to any shareholder who (1) has\nprovided the Fund either an incorrect tax\nidentification number or no number at all, (2)\nis subject to backup withholding by the IRS\nfor failure to properly report payments of\ninterest or dividends, (3) has failed to\ncertify to the Fund that such shareholder is\nnot subject to backup withholding, or (4) has\nnot certified that such shareholder is a U.S.\nperson (including a U.S. resident alien). The\nbackup withholding rate is currently 24%.\nBackup withholding will not be applied to\npayments that have been subject to the 30%\nwithholding tax on shareholders who are\nneither citizens nor permanent residents of\nthe United States. Other Tax Issues. The Fund\nmay be subject to tax in certain states where\nthe Fund does business (or is treated as doing\nbusiness as a result of its investments).\nFurthermore, in those states which have income\ntax laws, the tax treatment of the Fund and of\nFund shareholders with respect to\ndistributions by the Fund may differ from\nfederal tax treatment. The foregoing\ndiscussion summarizes some of the consequences\nunder current federal income tax law of an\ninvestment in the Fund. It is not a substitute\nfor personal tax advice. Consult your personal\ntax advisor about the potential tax\nconsequences of an investment in the Fund\nunder all applicable tax laws. General\nInformation The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nIf shareholders of the Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled\nto one vote for each Fund Share they own.\nAnnual meetings of shareholders will not be\nheld except as required by the 1940 Act and\nother applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization The\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. For purposes of the 1940\nAct, Fund Shares are issued by the respective\nseries of the Trust and the acquisition of\nFund Shares by investment companies is subject\nto the restrictions of Section 12(d)(1) of the\n1940 Act. The Trust has received exemptive\nrelief from Section 12(d)(1) to allow\nregistered investment companies to invest in\nthe Fund beyond the limits set forth in\nSection 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions as set forth in an SEC exemptive\norder issued to the Trust, including that such\ninvestment companies enter into an agreement\nwith the Trust. This order will be rescinded\nby the SEC on January 19, 2022. However,\neffective January 19, 2021, new Rule 12d1-4\npermits other investment companies to invest\nin the Fund beyond the limits in Section\n12(d)(1), subject to similar conditions. From\ntime to time, the Fund may advertise yield and\ntotal return figures. Yield is a historical\nmeasure of dividend income, and total return\nis a measure of past dividend income (assuming\nthat it has been reinvested) plus capital\nappreciation. Neither yield nor total return\nshould be used to predict the future\nperformance of the Fund. Morgan, Lewis &\nBockius LLP serves as counsel to the Trust,\nincluding the Fund. Ernst & Young LLP serves\nas the independent registered public\naccounting firm and will audit the Fund's\nfinancial statements annually. 26 Table of\nContents Financial Highlights The Fund had not\ncommenced operations prior to the date of this\nProspectus and, therefore, does not have\nfinancial information. 27\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhere to Learn More About the Fund This\nProspectus does not contain all the\ninformation included in the Registration\nStatement filed with the SEC with respect to\nFund Shares.

The offering\nof the Fund\u2019s shares (\u201cShares\u201d) is registered\nunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended\n(the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The investment\nobjective of the Fund is to provide investment\nresults that, before fees and expenses,\ncorrespond generally to the price and yield\nperformance of a specified market index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d). SSGA Funds Management, Inc. serves\nas the investment adviser for the Fund (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d) and the Fund is sub-\nadvised by State Street Global Advisors\nLimited (the \u201cSub-Adviser\u201d or \u201cSSGA LTD\u201d). To\nthe extent that a reference in this SAI refers\nto the \u201cAdviser,\u201d such reference should also\nbe read to refer to the Sub-Adviser where the\ncontext requires.\n\nThe Fund offers and issues Shares at its net\nasset value (sometimes referred to herein as\n\u201cNAV\u201d) only in aggregations of a specified\nnumber of Shares (each, a \u201cCreation Unit\u201d).\nThe Fund generally offers and issues Shares\neither in exchange for (i) a basket of\nsecurities designated by the Fund (\u201cDeposit\nSecurities\u201d) together with the deposit of a\nspecified cash payment (\u201cCash Component\u201d) or\n(ii) a cash payment equal in value to the\nDeposit Securities (\u201cDeposit Cash\u201d) together\nwith the Cash Component. The primary\nconsideration accepted by the Fund (i.e.,\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash) is set\nforth under \u201cPurchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units\u201d later in this SAI. The Trust\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of a \u201ccash in lieu\u201d amount to be\nadded to the Cash Component to replace any\nDeposit Security and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of Deposit Cash (subject to\napplicable legal requirements). The Shares\nhave been approved for listing and secondary\ntrading on a national securities exchange (the\n\u201cExchange\u201d). The Shares will trade on the\nExchange at market prices. These prices may\ndiffer from the Shares\u2019 net asset values. The\nShares are also redeemable only in Creation\nUnit aggregations, and generally in exchange\neither for (i) portfolio securities and a\nspecified cash payment or (ii) cash (subject\nto applicable legal requirements).\n\nShares may be issued in advance of receipt of\nDeposit Securities subject to various\nconditions including a requirement to maintain\non deposit with the Trust cash at least equal\nto a specified percentage of the market value\nof the missing Deposit Securities, as set\nforth in the Participant Agreement (as defined\nbelow). See \u201cPurchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units.\u201d The Trust may impose a\ntransaction fee for each creation or\nredemption. In all cases, such fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) applicable to management investment\ncompanies offering redeemable securities. In\naddition to the fixed creation or redemption\ntransaction fee, an additional transaction fee\nof up to three times the fixed creation or\nredemption transaction fee and/or an\nadditional variable charge may apply.\n                                              \n             INVESTMENT POLICIES              \n                                              \nThe Fund may invest in the following types of\ninvestments, consistent with its investment\nstrategies and objective. Please see the\nFund\u2019s Prospectus for additional information\nregarding its principal investment strategies.\n\nDIVERSIFICATION STATUS\n\nThe Fund is classified as a non-diversified\ninvestment company under the 1940 Act. A \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d classification means that the\nFund is not limited by the 1940 Act with\nregard to the percentage of its assets that\nmay be invested in the securities of a single\nissuer. This means that the Fund may invest a\ngreater portion of its assets in the\nsecurities of a single issuer than a\ndiversified fund. The securities of a\nparticular issuer may constitute a greater\nportion of the Index and, therefore, the\nsecurities may constitute a greater portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio. This may have an adverse\neffect on the Fund\u2019s performance or subject\nthe Fund\u2019s Shares to greater price volatility\nthan more diversified investment companies.\n\nThe Fund intends to maintain the required\nlevel of diversification and otherwise conduct\nits operations so as to qualify as a\n\u201cregulated investment company\u201d (\u201cRIC\u201d) for\npurposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nas amended (\u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d), and to\nrelieve the Fund of any liability for federal\nincome tax to the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to shareholders. Compliance with\nthe diversification requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code may limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective.\n\nASSET-BACKED AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED\nSECURITIES\n\nAsset-backed securities are securities backed\nby installment contracts, credit-card\nreceivables or other assets. Commercial\nmortgage-backed securities are securities\nbacked by commercial real estate properties.\nBoth asset-backed and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities represent interests in\n\u201cpools\u201d of assets in which payments of both\ninterest and principal on the securities are\nmade on a regular basis. The payments are, in\neffect, \u201cpassed through\u201d to the holder of the\nsecurities (net of any fees paid to the issuer\nor\n                      3                       \nguarantor of the securities). The average life\nof asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities varies with the maturities of the\nunderlying instruments and, as a result of\nprepayments, can often be less than the\noriginal maturity of the assets underlying the\nsecurities. For this and other reasons, an\nasset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurity\u2019s stated maturity may be shortened,\nand the security\u2019s total return may be\ndifficult to predict precisely.\n\nBONDS\n\nA bond is an interest-bearing security issued\nby a company, governmental unit or, in some\ncases, a non-U.S. entity. The issuer of a bond\nhas a contractual obligation to pay interest\nat a stated rate on specific dates and to\nrepay principal (the bond\u2019s face value)\nperiodically or on a specified maturity date;\nprovided, however, a zero coupon bond pays no\ninterest to its holder during its life. The\nvalue of a zero coupon bond to the Fund\nconsists of the difference between such bond\u2019s\nface value at the time of maturity and the\nprice for which it was acquired, which may be\nan amount significantly less than its face\nvalue (sometimes referred to as a \u201cdeep\ndiscount\u201d price).\n\nAn issuer may have the right to redeem or\n\u201ccall\u201d a bond before maturity, in which case\nthe investor may have to reinvest the proceeds\nat lower market rates. Most bonds bear\ninterest income at a \u201ccoupon\u201d rate that is\nfixed for the life of the bond. The value of a\nfixed rate bond usually rises when market\ninterest rates fall, and falls when market\ninterest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed rate\nbond\u2019s yield (income as a percent of the\nbond\u2019s current value) may differ from its\ncoupon rate as its value rises or falls. Fixed\nrate bonds generally are also subject to\ninflation risk, which is the risk that the\nvalue of the bond or income from the bond will\nbe worth less in the future as inflation\ndecreases the value of money. This could mean\nthat, as inflation increases, the \u201creal\u201d value\nof the assets of the Fund holding fixed rate\nbonds can decline, as can the value of the\nFund\u2019s distributions. Other types of bonds\nbear income at an interest rate that is\nadjusted periodically. Because of their\nadjustable interest rates, the value of\n\u201cfloating-rate\u201d or \u201cvariable-rate\u201d bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed rate bonds. The Fund may treat some of\nthese bonds as having a shorter maturity for\npurposes of calculating the weighted average\nmaturity of its investment portfolio. Bonds\nmay be senior or subordinated obligations.\nSenior obligations generally have the first\nclaim on a corporation\u2019s earnings and assets\nand, in the event of liquidation, are paid\nbefore subordinated obligations. Bonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer\u2019s general\ncreditworthiness) or secured (also backed by\nspecified collateral).\n\nThe investment return of corporate bonds\nreflects interest on the bond and changes in\nthe market value of the bond. The market value\nof a corporate bond may be affected by the\ncredit rating of the corporation, the\ncorporation\u2019s performance and perceptions of\nthe corporation in the market place. There is\na risk that the issuers of the securities may\nnot be able to meet their obligations on\ninterest or principal payments at the time\ncalled for by such a security.\n\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER\n\nCommercial paper consists of short-term,\npromissory notes issued by banks, corporations\nand other entities to finance short-term\ncredit needs. These securities generally are\ndiscounted but sometimes may be interest\nbearing.\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\nThe Fund will concentrate its investments in\nsecurities of issuers in the same industry as\nmay be necessary to approximate the\ncomposition of the Fund\u2019s underlying Index.\nThe securities of issuers in particular\nindustries may dominate the benchmark Index of\nthe Fund and consequently the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio. This may adversely\naffect the Fund\u2019s performance or subject its\nShares to greater price volatility than that\nexperienced by less concentrated investment\ncompanies. The Trust\u2019s general policy is to\nexclude securities of the U.S. government and\nits agencies or instrumentalities when\nmeasuring industry concentration.\n\nIn pursuing its objective, the Fund may hold\nthe securities of a single issuer in an amount\nexceeding 10% of the market value of the\noutstanding securities of the issuer, subject\nto restrictions imposed by the Internal\nRevenue Code. In particular, as the Fund\u2019s\nsize grows and its assets increase, it will be\nmore likely to hold more than 10% of the\nsecurities of a single issuer if the issuer\nhas a relatively small public float as\ncompared to other components in its benchmark\nIndex.\n\nCONVERTIBLE SECURITIES\n\nConvertible securities are bonds, debentures,\nnotes, preferred stocks or other securities\nthat may be converted or exchanged (by the\nholder or by the issuer) into shares of the\nunderlying common stock (or cash or securities\nof equivalent value) at a stated exchange\nratio. A convertible security may also be\ncalled for redemption or conversion by the\nissuer after a particular date and under\ncertain circumstances (including a specified\nprice) established upon issue. If a\nconvertible security held by the Fund is\ncalled for redemption or conversion, the Fund\ncould be required to tender it for redemption,\nconvert it into the underlying common stock,\nor sell it to a third party.\n                      4                       \nConvertible securities generally have less\npotential for gain or loss than common stock.\nConvertible securities generally provide\nyields higher than underlying common stock,\nbut generally lower than comparable non-\nconvertible securities. Because of this higher\nyield, convertible securities generally sell\nat a price above their \u201cconversion value,\u201d\nwhich is the current market value of the stock\nto be received upon conversion. The difference\nbetween this conversion value and the price of\nconvertible securities will vary over time\ndepending on changes in the value of the\nunderlying common stock and interest rates.\nWhen the underlying common stock declines in\nvalue, convertible securities will tend not to\ndecline to the same extent because of the\ninterest or dividend payments and the\nrepayment of principal at maturity for certain\ntypes of convertible securities. However,\nsecurities that are convertible other than at\nthe option of the holder generally do not\nlimit the potential for loss to the same\nextent as securities convertible at the option\nof the holder. When the underlying common\nstock rises in value, the value of convertible\nsecurities may also be expected to increase.\nAt the same time, however, the difference\nbetween the market value of convertible\nsecurities and their conversion value will\nnarrow, which means that the value of\nconvertible securities will generally not\nincrease to the same extent as the value of\nthe underlying common stock. Because\nconvertible securities may also be interest-\nrate sensitive, their value may increase as\ninterest rates fall and decrease as interest\nrates rise. Convertible securities are also\nsubject to credit risk, and are often lower-\nquality securities.\n\nEXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS\n\nThe Fund may invest in other exchange-traded\nfunds (including ETFs managed by the Adviser).\nETFs may be structured as investment companies\nthat are registered under the 1940 Act,\ntypically as open-end funds or unit investment\ntrusts. These ETFs are generally based on\nspecific domestic and foreign market\nsecurities indices. An \u201cindex-based ETF\u201d seeks\nto provide investment results that match the\nperformance of an index by holding in its\nportfolio either the contents of the index or\na representative sample of the securities in\nthe index. An \u201cactively-managed ETF\u201d invests\nin securities based on an adviser\u2019s investment\nstrategy. An \u201cenhanced ETF\u201d seeks to provide\ninvestment results that match a positive or\nnegative multiple of the performance of an\nunderlying index. In seeking to provide such\nresults, an ETF and, in particular, an\nenhanced ETF, may engage in short sales of\nsecurities included in the underlying index\nand may invest in derivatives instruments,\nsuch as equity index swaps, futures contracts,\nand options on securities, futures contracts,\nand stock indices. Alternatively, ETFs may be\nstructured as grantor trusts or other forms of\npooled investment vehicles that are not\nregistered or regulated under the 1940 Act.\nThese ETFs typically hold commodities,\nprecious metals, currency or other non-\nsecurities investments. ETFs, like mutual\nfunds, have expenses associated with their\noperation, such as advisory and custody fees.\nWhen the Fund invests in an ETF, in addition\nto directly bearing expenses associated with\nits own operations, including the brokerage\ncosts associated with the purchase and sale of\nshares of the ETF, the Fund will bear a pro\nrata portion of the ETF\u2019s expenses. In\naddition, it may be more costly to own an ETF\nthan to directly own the securities or other\ninvestments held by the ETF because of ETF\nexpenses. The risks of owning shares of an ETF\ngenerally reflect the risks of owning the\nunderlying securities or other investments\nheld by the ETF, although lack of liquidity in\nthe market for the shares of an ETF could\nresult in the ETF\u2019s value being more volatile\nthan the underlying securities or other\ninvestments.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe Fund may conduct foreign currency\ntransactions on a spot (i.e., cash) or forward\nbasis (i.e., by entering into forward\ncontracts to purchase or sell foreign\ncurrencies). Although foreign exchange dealers\ngenerally do not charge a fee for such\nconversions, they do realize a profit based on\nthe difference between the prices at which\nthey are buying and selling various\ncurrencies. Thus, a dealer may offer to sell a\nforeign currency at one rate, while offering a\nlesser rate of exchange should the\ncounterparty desire to resell that currency to\nthe dealer. Forward contracts are customized\ntransactions that generally require a specific\namount of a currency to be delivered at a\nspecific exchange rate on a specific date or\nrange of dates in the future, although the\nFund may also enter into non-deliverable\ncurrency forward contracts (\u201cNDFs\u201d) that\ncontractually require the netting of the\nparties\u2019 liabilities. Forwards, including\nNDFs, can have substantial price volatility.\nWhile foreign currency transactions on a spot\nand forward basis are exempt from the\ndefinition of \u201cswap\u201d under the Commodity\nExchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d), NDFs are not, and, thus,\nare subject to the jurisdiction of the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d).\nForward contracts are generally traded in an\ninterbank market directly between currency\ntraders (usually large commercial banks) and\ntheir customers. The parties to a forward\ncontract may agree to offset or terminate the\ncontract before its maturity, or may hold the\ncontract to maturity and complete the\ncontemplated currency exchange. In the event\nthat the parties to a forward contract agree\nto offset or terminate the contract before its\nmaturity, the contract is no longer exempt\nfrom the definition of \u201cswap\u201d under the CEA\nand shall be treated as a swap. At the\ndiscretion of the Adviser, the Fund may enter\ninto forward currency exchange contracts for\nhedging purposes to help reduce the risks and\nvolatility caused by changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, or to gain exposure\nto certain currencies in an effort to track\nthe composition of the Index. When used for\nhedging purposes, they tend to limit any\npotential gain that may be realized if the\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s foreign holdings increases\nbecause of currency fluctuations.\n\nFUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in\nderivatives, including exchange-traded futures\non indices, exchange-traded futures on\nTreasuries or Eurodollars, U.S. exchange-\ntraded or OTC put and call options contracts\nand exchange-traded or OTC swap transactions\n(including NDFs interest rate swaps, total\nreturn swaps, excess return swaps, and credit\ndefault swaps). The Fund will segregate cash\nand/or appropriate liquid assets if required\nto do so by current SEC or CFTC regulation or\ninterpretation.\n                      5                       \nFutures and Options on Futures. Futures\ncontracts generally provide for the future\nsale by one party and purchase by another\nparty of a specified commodity or security at\na specified future time and at a specified\nprice. Index futures contracts are settled\ndaily with a payment by one party to the other\nof a cash amount based on the difference\nbetween the level of the index specified in\nthe contract from one day to the next. A\nfutures contract on an index is an agreement\npursuant to which two parties agree to take or\nmake delivery of an amount of cash equal to\nthe difference between the value of the index\nat the close of the last trading day of the\ncontract and the price at which the index\ncontract originally was written. Although the\nvalue of an index might be a function of the\nvalue of certain specified securities,\nphysical delivery of these securities is not\nalways made. A public market exists in futures\ncontracts covering a number of indexes, as\nwell as financial instruments, including,\nwithout limitation: U.S. Treasury bonds; U.S.\nTreasury notes; GNMA Certificates; three-month\nU.S. Treasury bills; 90-day commercial paper;\nbank certificates of deposit; Eurodollar\ncertificates of deposit; the Australian\nDollar; the Canadian Dollar; the British\nPound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss Franc; the\nMexican Peso; and certain multinational\ncurrencies, such as the Euro. It is expected\nthat other futures contracts will be developed\nand traded in the future. Futures contracts\nare standardized as to maturity date and\nunderlying instrument and are traded on\nfutures exchanges.\n\nThe Fund may purchase and write (sell) call\nand put options on futures. Options on futures\ngive the holder the right, in return for the\npremium paid, to assume a long position (call)\nor short position (put) in a futures contract\nat a specified exercise price upon expiration\nof, or at any time during the period of, the\noption. Upon exercise of a call option, the\nholder acquires a long position in the futures\ncontract and the writer is assigned the\nopposite short position. In the case of a put\noption, the opposite is true.\n\nThe Fund is required to make a good faith\nmargin deposit in cash or U.S. government\nsecurities (or other eligible collateral) with\na broker or custodian to initiate and maintain\nopen positions in futures contracts. A margin\ndeposit is intended to assure completion of\nthe contract (delivery or acceptance of the\nunderlying commodity or payment of the cash\nsettlement amount) if it is not terminated\nprior to the specified delivery date. Brokers\nmay establish deposit requirements which are\nhigher than the exchange minimums. Futures\ncontracts are customarily purchased and sold\non margin deposits which may range upward from\nless than 5% of the value of the contract\nbeing traded.\n\nAfter a futures contract position is opened,\nthe value of the contract is marked to market\ndaily. If the futures contract price changes\nto the extent that the margin on deposit does\nnot satisfy price changes additional payments\nwill be required. Conversely, change in the\ncontract value may reduce the required margin,\nresulting in a repayment of excess margin to\nthe contract holder. Variation margin payments\nare made to and from the futures broker for as\nlong as the contract remains open. In such\ncase, the Fund would expect to earn interest\nincome on its margin deposits. Although some\nfutures contracts call for making or taking\ndelivery of the underlying commodity,\ngenerally these obligations are closed out\nprior to delivery by offsetting purchases or\nsales of matching futures contracts (involving\nthe same exchange, underlying security or\nindex and delivery month). If an offsetting\npurchase price is less than the original sale\nprice, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if\nit is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss.\nConversely, if an offsetting sale price is\nmore than the original purchase price, the\nFund realizes a capital gain, or if it is\nless, the Fund realizes a capital loss. The\ntransaction costs also must be included in\nthese calculations.\n\nOptions. The Fund may purchase and sell put\nand call options. Such options may relate to\nparticular securities and may or may not be\nlisted on a national securities exchange and\nissued by the Options Clearing Corporation.\nOptions trading is a highly specialized\nactivity that entails greater than ordinary\ninvestment risk. Options on particular\nsecurities may be more volatile than the\nunderlying securities, and therefore, on a\npercentage basis, an investment in options may\nbe subject to greater fluctuation than an\ninvestment in the underlying securities\nthemselves.\n\nShort Sales \u201cAgainst the Box.\u201d The Fund may\nengage in short sales \u201cagainst the box.\u201d In a\nshort sale against the box, the Fund agrees to\nsell at a future date a security that it\neither contemporaneously owns or has the right\nto acquire at no extra cost. If the price of\nthe security has declined at the time the Fund\nis required to deliver the security, the Fund\nwill benefit from the difference in the price.\nIf the price of the security has increased,\nthe Fund will be required to pay the\ndifference.\n\nSwap Transactions. The Fund may enter into\nswap transactions, including interest rate,\nswap, credit default swap, NDF, and total\nreturn swap transactions. Swap transactions\nare contracts between parties in which one\nparty agrees to make periodic payments to the\nother party based on the change in market\nvalue or level of a specified rate, index or\nasset. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake payments to the first party based on the\nreturn of a different specified rate, index or\nasset. Swap transactions will usually be done\non a net basis, i.e., where the two parties\nmake net payments with the Fund receiving or\npaying, as the case may be, only the net\namount of the two payments. The net amount of\nthe excess, if any, of the Fund\u2019s obligations\nover its entitlements with respect to each\nswap is accrued on a daily basis and an amount\nof cash or equivalents having an aggregate\nvalue at least equal to the accrued excess is\nmaintained by the Fund. Swaps may be used in\nconjunction with other instruments to offset\ninterest rate, currency or other underlying\n                      6                       \nrisks. For example, interest rate swaps may be\noffset with \u201ccaps,\u201d \u201cfloors\u201d or \u201ccollars\u201d. A\n\u201ccap\u201d is essentially a call option which\nplaces a limit on the amount of floating rate\ninterest that must be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201cfloor\u201d is essentially a\nput option which places a limit on the minimum\namount that would be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201ccollar\u201d is essentially a\ncombination of a long cap and a short floor\nwhere the limits are set at different levels.\n\nThe use of swap transactions by the Fund\nentails certain risks, which may be different\nfrom, or possibly greater than, the risks\nassociated with investing directly in the\nsecurities and other investments that are the\nreferenced asset for the swap agreement. Swaps\nare highly specialized instruments that\nrequire investment techniques, risk analyses,\nand tax planning different from those\nassociated with stocks, bonds, and other\ntraditional investments. The use of a swap\nrequires an understanding not only of the\nreferenced asset, reference rate, or index,\nbut also of the swap itself, without the\nbenefit of observing the performance of the\nswap under all the possible market conditions.\nBecause some swap transactions have a leverage\ncomponent, adverse changes in the value or\nlevel of the underlying asset, reference rate,\nor index can result in a loss substantially\ngreater than the amount invested in the swap\nitself. Certain swaps have the potential for\nunlimited loss, regardless of the size of the\ninitial investment.\n\nBilateral OTC transactions differ from\nexchange-traded or cleared derivatives\ntransactions in several respects. Bilateral\nOTC transactions are transacted directly with\ndealers and not with a clearing corporation.\nWithout the availability of a clearing\ncorporation, bilateral OTC transaction pricing\nis normally done by reference to information\nfrom market makers and/or available index\ndata, which information is carefully monitored\nby the Adviser and verified in appropriate\ncases. As bilateral OTC transactions are\nentered into directly with a dealer, there is\na risk of nonperformance by the dealer as a\nresult of its insolvency or otherwise. Under\nrecently-adopted regulations by the CFTC and\nfederal banking regulators (\u201cMargin Rules\u201d),\nthe Fund is required to post collateral (known\nas variation margin) to cover the mark-to-\nmarket exposure in respect of its uncleared\nswaps. The Margin Rules also mandate that\ncollateral in the form of initial margin be\nposted to cover potential future exposure\nattributable to uncleared swap transactions.\nIn the event the Fund is required to post\ncollateral in the form of initial margin or\nvariation margin in respect of its uncleared\nswap transactions, all such collateral will be\nposted with a third party custodian pursuant\nto a triparty custody agreement between the\nFund, its dealer counterparty and an\nunaffiliated custodian.\n\nThe requirement to execute certain OTC\nderivatives contracts on SEFs may offer\ncertain advantages over traditional bilateral\nOTC trading, such as ease of execution, price\ntransparency, increased liquidity and/or\nfavorable pricing. However, SEF trading may\nmake it more difficult and costly for the Fund\nto enter into highly tailored or customized\ntransactions and may result in additional\ncosts and risks. Market participants such as\nthe Fund that execute derivatives contracts\nthrough a SEF, whether directly or through a\nbroker intermediary, are required to submit to\nthe jurisdiction of the SEF and comply with\nSEF and CFTC rules and regulations which\nimpose, among other things disclosure and\nrecordkeeping obligations. In addition, the\nFund will generally incur SEF or broker\nintermediary fees when it trades on a SEF. The\nFund may also be required to indemnify the SEF\nor broker intermediary for any losses or costs\nthat may result from the Fund\u2019s transactions\non the SEF.\n\nTotal Return Swaps. The Fund may enter into\ntotal return swap transactions for investment\npurposes. Total return swaps are transactions\nin which one party agrees to make periodic\npayments based on the change in market value\nof the underlying assets, which may include a\nspecified security, basket of securities or\nsecurity indexes during the specified period,\nin return for periodic payments based on a\nfixed or variable interest rate of the total\nreturn from other underlying assets. Total\nreturn swaps may be used to obtain exposure to\na security or market without owning or taking\nphysical custody of such security or market,\nincluding in cases in which there may be\ndisadvantages associated with direct ownership\nof a particular security. In a typical total\nreturn equity swap, payments made by the Fund\nor the counterparty are based on the total\nreturn of a particular reference asset or\nassets (such as an equity security, a\ncombination of such securities, or an index).\nThat is, one party agrees to pay another party\nthe return on a stock, basket of stocks, or\nstock index in return for a specified interest\nrate. By entering into an equity index swap,\nfor example, the index receiver can gain\nexposure to stocks making up the index of\nsecurities without actually purchasing those\nstocks. Total return swaps involve not only\nthe risk associated with the investment in the\nunderlying securities, but also the risk of\nthe counterparty not fulfilling its\nobligations under the agreement.\n\nCredit Default Swaps. The Fund may enter into\ncredit default swap transactions for\ninvestment purposes. A credit default swap\ntransaction may have as reference obligations\none or more securities that are not currently\nheld by the Fund. The Fund may be either the\nprotection buyer or protection seller in the\ntransaction. Credit default swaps may also be\nstructured based on the debt of a basket of\nissuers, rather than a single issuer, and may\nbe customized with respect to the default\nevent that triggers purchase or other factors.\nAs a protection seller, the Fund would\ngenerally receive an upfront payment or a\nfixed rate of income throughout the term of\nthe swap, which typically is between six\nmonths and three years, provided that there is\nno credit event. If a credit event occurs,\ngenerally the protection seller must pay the\nprotection buyer the full face amount of the\nreference obligations that may have little or\nno value. The notional value of the credit\ndefault swap will be used to segregate liquid\nassets for selling protection on credit\ndefault swaps. If the Fund were a protection\nbuyer and no credit event occurred during the\nterm of the swap, the Fund would recover\nnothing if the swap were held through its\ntermination date. However, if a credit event\noccurred, the protection buyer may elect to\nreceive the full notional value of the swap in\nexchange for an equal face amount of the\nreference obligation that may have little or\nno value. Where the Fund is\n                      7                       \nthe protection buyer, credit default swaps\ninvolve the risk that the seller may fail to\nsatisfy its payment obligations to the Fund in\nthe event of a default. The purchase of credit\ndefault swaps involves costs, which will\nreduce the Fund\u2019s return. When the Fund buys\ncredit default swaps it will segregate an\namount at least equal to the amount of any\naccrued premium payment obligations including\namounts for early terminations.\n\nCurrency Swaps. The Fund may enter into\ncurrency swap transactions for investment\npurposes. Currency swaps are similar to\ninterest rate swaps, except that they involve\nmultiple currencies. The Fund may enter into a\ncurrency swap when it has exposure to one\ncurrency and desires exposure to a different\ncurrency. Typically, the interest rates that\ndetermine the currency swap payments are\nfixed, although occasionally one or both\nparties may pay a floating rate of interest.\nUnlike an interest rate swap, however, the\nprincipal amounts are exchanged at the\nbeginning of the contract and returned at the\nend of the contract. In addition to paying and\nreceiving amounts at the beginning and end of\nthe transaction, both sides will have to pay\nin full on a periodic basis based upon the\ncurrency they have borrowed. Change in foreign\nexchange rates and changes in interest rates,\nas described above, may negatively affect\ncurrency swaps.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps. The Fund may enter into\nan interest rate swap in an effort to protect\nagainst declines in the value of fixed income\nsecurities held by the Fund. In such an\ninstance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed\nrate (multiplied by a notional amount) while a\ncounterparty agrees to pay a floating rate\n(multiplied by the same notional amount). If\ninterest rates rise, resulting in a diminution\nin the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio, the Fund\nwould receive payments under the swap that\nwould offset, in whole or in part, such\ndiminution in value.\n\nOptions on Swaps. An option on a swap\nagreement, or a \u201cswaption,\u201d is a contract that\ngives a counterparty the right (but not the\nobligation) to enter into a new swap agreement\nor to shorten, extend, cancel or otherwise\nmodify an existing swap agreement, at some\ndesignated future time on specified terms. In\nreturn, the purchaser pays a \u201cpremium\u201d to the\nseller of the contract. The seller of the\ncontract receives the premium and bears the\nrisk of unfavorable changes on the underlying\nswap. The Fund may write (sell) and purchase\nput and call swaptions. The Fund may also\nenter into swaptions on either an asset-based\nor liability-based basis, depending on whether\nthe Fund is hedging its assets or its\nliabilities. The Fund may write (sell) and\npurchase put and call swaptions to the same\nextent it may make use of standard options on\nsecurities or other instruments. The Fund may\nenter into these transactions primarily to\npreserve a return or spread on a particular\ninvestment or portion of its holdings, as a\nduration management technique, to protect\nagainst an increase in the price of securities\nthe Fund anticipates purchasing at a later\ndate, or for any other purposes, such as for\nspeculation to increase returns. Swaptions are\ngenerally subject to the same risks involved\nin the Fund\u2019s use of options.\n\nDepending on the terms of the particular\noption agreement, the Fund will generally\nincur a greater degree of risk when it writes\na swaption than it will incur when it\npurchases a swaption. When the Fund purchases\na swaption, it risks losing only the amount of\nthe premium it has paid should it decide to\nlet the option expire unexercised. However,\nwhen the Fund writes a swaption, upon exercise\nof the option the Fund will become obligated\naccording to the terms of the underlying\nagreement.\n\nGovernment Regulation.The Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the\n\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) that was signed into law on\nJuly 21, 2010 created a new statutory\nframework that comprehensively regulated the\nover-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives markets\nfor the first time. Prior to the Dodd-Frank\nAct, the OTC derivatives markets were\ntraditionally traded on a bilateral basis (so-\ncalled \u201cbilateral OTC transactions\u201d). Under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, certain OTC derivatives\ntransactions are now required to be centrally\ncleared and traded on exchanges or electronic\ntrading platforms called swap execution\nfacilities (\u201cSEFs\u201d).\n\nOn October 28, 2020, the SEC adopted Rule\n18f-4 (the \u201cDerivatives Rule\u201d) under the 1940\nAct which, following an implementation period,\nwill replace existing SEC and staff guidance\nwith an updated, comprehensive framework for\nregistered funds\u2019 use of derivatives. Among\nother changes, the Derivatives Rule will\nrequire the Fund to trade derivatives and\ncertain other instruments that create future\npayment or delivery obligations subject to a\nvalue-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) leverage limit, develop\nand implement a derivatives risk management\nprogram and new testing requirements, and\ncomply with new requirements related to board\nand SEC reporting. These new requirements will\napply unless the Fund qualifies as a \u201climited\nderivatives user,\u201d as defined in the\nDerivatives Rule. To the extent the Fund uses\nderivatives, complying with the Derivatives\nRule may increase the cost of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments and cost of doing business, which\ncould adversely affect investors. Other new\nregulations could adversely affect the value,\navailability and performance of certain\nderivative instruments, may make them more\ncostly, and may limit or restrict their use by\nthe Fund.\n\nRegulation Under the Commodity Exchange Act.\nThe Fund intends to use commodity interests,\nsuch as futures, swaps and options on futures\nin accordance with Rule 4.5 of the CEA. The\nFund may use exchange-traded futures and\noptions on futures, together with positions in\ncash and money market instruments, to simulate\nfull investment in its underlying Index.\nExchange-traded futures and options on futures\ncontracts may not be currently available for\nthe Index. Under such circumstances, the\nAdviser may seek to utilize other instruments\nthat it believes to be correlated to the\napplicable Index components or a subset of the\ncomponents. An exclusion from the definition\nof the term \u201ccommodity pool operator\u201d has been\nclaimed with respect to each series of the\nTrust in accordance with Rule 4.5 such that\nregistration or regulation as a commodity pool\noperator under the CEA is not necessary.\n                      8                       \nRestrictions on Trading in Commodity\nInterests. The Fund reserves the right to\nengage in transactions involving futures,\noptions thereon and swaps to the extent\nallowed by the CFTC regulations in effect from\ntime to time and in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\npolicies. The Fund would take steps to prevent\nits futures positions from \u201cleveraging\u201d its\nsecurities holdings. When it has a long\nfutures position, it will maintain with its\ncustodian bank assets substantially identical\nto those underlying the contract or cash and\nequivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position). When it has a\nshort futures position, it will maintain with\nits custodian bank assets substantially\nidentical to those underlying the contract or\ncash and equivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position).\n\nCertain additional risk factors related to\nderivatives are discussed below:\n\nDerivatives Risk. Under recently adopted rules\nby the CFTC, transactions in some types of\ninterest rate swaps and index credit default\nswaps on North American and European indices\nare required to be cleared. In addition, the\nCFTC may promulgate additional regulations\nthat require clearing of other classes of\nswaps. In a cleared derivatives transaction\n(which includes commodities futures and\ncleared swaps transactions), the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty is a clearing house (such as CME,\nICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet), rather than\na bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a\nmember of a clearing house and only members of\na clearing house can participate directly in\nthe clearing house, the Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers, who are futures commission merchants\nthat are members of the clearing houses and\nwho have the appropriate regulatory approvals\nto engage in cleared swap transactions. The\nFund makes and receives payments owed under\ncleared derivatives transactions (including\nmargin payments) through its accounts at\nclearing members. Clearing members guarantee\nperformance of their clients\u2019 obligations to\nthe clearing house. In contrast to bilateral\nOTC transactions, clearing members generally\ncan require termination of existing cleared\nderivatives transactions at any time and\nincreases in margin above the margin that it\nrequired at the beginning of a transaction.\nClearing houses also have broad rights to\nincrease margin requirements for existing\ntransactions and to terminate transactions.\nAny such increase or termination could\ninterfere with the ability of the Fund to\npursue its investment strategy. Also, the Fund\nis subject to execution risk if it enters into\na derivatives transaction that is required to\nbe cleared (or that the Advisor expects to be\ncleared), and no clearing member is willing or\nable to clear the transaction on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf. While the documentation in place\nbetween the Fund and its clearing members\ngenerally provides that the clearing members\nwill accept for clearing all transactions\nsubmitted for clearing that are within credit\nlimits specified by the clearing members in\nadvance, the Fund could be subject to this\nexecution risk if the Fund submits for\nclearing transactions that exceed such credit\nlimits, if the clearing house does not accept\nthe transactions for clearing, or if the\nclearing members do not comply with their\nagreement to clear such transactions. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of any increase in the\nvalue of the transaction after the time of the\ntransaction. In addition, new regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict the Fund\u2019s\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to\nthe Fund of, derivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund or increasing\nmargin or capital requirements. If the Fund is\nnot able to enter into a particular\nderivatives transaction, the Fund\u2019s investment\nperformance and risk profile could be\nadversely affected as a result.\n\nCounterparty Risk. Counterparty risk with\nrespect to OTC derivatives may be affected by\nnew regulations promulgated by the CFTC and\nSEC affecting the derivatives market. As\ndescribed under \u201cDerivatives Risk\u201d above, some\nderivatives transactions are required to be\ncleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives\ntransaction is subject to the credit risk of\nthe clearing house and the clearing member\nthrough which it holds its cleared derivatives\nposition, rather than the credit risk of its\noriginal counterparty to the derivative\ntransaction. Clearing members are required to\nsegregate all funds received from customers\nwith respect to cleared derivatives\ntransactions from the clearing member\u2019s\nproprietary assets. However, all funds and\nother property received by a clearing broker\nfrom its customers are generally held by the\nclearing broker on a commingled basis in an\nomnibus account, which may also invest those\nfunds in certain instruments permitted under\nthe applicable regulations. Also, the clearing\nmember transfers to the clearing house the\namount of margin required by the clearing\nhouse for cleared derivatives transactions,\nwhich amounts are generally held in the\nrelevant omnibus account at the clearing house\nfor all customers of the clearing member.\n\nFor commodities futures positions, the\nclearing house may use all of the collateral\nheld in the clearing member\u2019s omnibus account\nto meet a loss in that account, without regard\nto which customer in fact supplied that\ncollateral. Accordingly, in addition to\nbearing the credit risk of its clearing\nmember, each customer to a futures transaction\nalso bears \u201cfellow customer\u201d risk from other\ncustomers of the clearing member. However,\nwith respect to cleared swaps positions,\nrecent regulations promulgated by the CFTC\nrequire that the clearing member notify the\nclearing house of the amount of initial margin\nprovided by the clearing member to the\nclearing house that is attributable to each\ncustomer. Because margin in respect of cleared\nswaps must be earmarked for specific clearing\nmember customers, the clearing house may not\nuse the collateral of one customer to cover\nthe obligations of another customer. However,\nif the clearing member does not provide\naccurate reporting, the Fund is subject to the\nrisk that a clearing house will use the Fund\u2019s\nassets held in an omnibus account at the\nclearing house to satisfy payment obligations\nof a defaulting customer of the clearing\nmember to the clearing house. In addition,\nclearing members may generally choose to\nprovide to the clearing house the net amount\nof variation margin required for cleared swaps\nfor all of its customers in the aggregate,\nrather than the gross amount for each\ncustomer.\n                      9                       \nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nThe Fund may take advantage of opportunities\nin the area of options and futures contracts,\noptions on futures contracts, warrants, swaps\nand any other investments which are not\npresently contemplated for use by the Fund or\nwhich are not currently available but which\nmay be developed, to the extent such\nopportunities are both consistent with the\nFund\u2019s investment objective and legally\npermissible for the Fund. Before entering into\nsuch transactions or making any such\ninvestment, the Fund will provide appropriate\ndisclosure.\n\nHIGH YIELD SECURITIES\n\nInvestment in high yield securities (commonly\nknown as \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) generally provides\ngreater income and increased opportunity for\ncapital appreciation than investments in\nhigher quality securities, but they also\ntypically entail greater price volatility and\ncredit risk. These high yield securities are\nregarded as predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the issuer\u2019s continuing ability to\nmeet principal and interest payments. Analysis\nof the creditworthiness of issuers of debt\nsecurities that are high yield may be more\ncomplex than for issuers of higher quality\ndebt securities. In addition, high yield\nsecurities are often issued by smaller, less\ncreditworthy companies or by highly leveraged\n(indebted) firms, but can also be issued by\ngovernments. Such issuers are generally less\nable than more financially stable issuers to\nmake scheduled payments of interest and\nprincipal. The risks posed by securities\nissued under such circumstances are\nsubstantial.\n\nInvesting in high yield debt securities\ninvolves risks that are greater than the risks\nof investing in higher quality debt\nsecurities. These risks include: (i) changes\nin credit status, including weaker overall\ncredit conditions of issuers and risks of\ndefault; (ii) industry, market and economic\nrisk; and (iii) greater price variability and\ncredit risks of certain high yield securities\nsuch as zero coupon and payment-in-kind\nsecurities. While these risks provide the\nopportunity for maximizing return over time,\nthey may result in greater volatility of the\nvalue of the Fund than a fund that invests in\nhigher-rated securities.\n\nFurthermore, the value of high yield\nsecurities may be more susceptible to real or\nperceived adverse economic, company or\nindustry conditions than is the case for\nhigher quality securities. The market values\nof certain of these lower-rated and unrated\ndebt securities tend to reflect individual\nissuer developments to a greater extent than\ndo higher-rated securities which react\nprimarily to fluctuations in the general level\nof interest rates, and tend to be more\nsensitive to economic conditions than are\nhigher-rated securities. Adverse market,\ncredit or economic conditions could make it\ndifficult at certain times to sell certain\nhigh yield securities held by the Fund.\n\nThe secondary market on which high yield\nsecurities are traded may be less liquid than\nthe market for higher grade securities. Less\nliquidity in the secondary trading market\ncould adversely affect the price at which the\nFund could sell a high yield security, and\ncould adversely affect the daily net asset\nvalue per share of the Fund. When secondary\nmarkets for high yield securities are less\nliquid than the market for higher grade\nsecurities, it may be more difficult to value\nthe securities because there is less reliable,\nobjective data available.\n\nThe use of credit ratings as a principal\nmethod of selecting high yield securities can\ninvolve certain risks. For example, credit\nratings evaluate the safety of principal and\ninterest payments, not the market value risk\nof high yield securities. Also, credit rating\nagencies may fail to change credit ratings in\na timely fashion to reflect events since the\nsecurity was last rated.\n\nILLIQUID SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in illiquid securities.\nThe Fund may not acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid\nsecurities. An illiquid security means any\nsecurity that the Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in current\nmarket conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without the sale or disposition\nsignificantly changing the market value of the\ninvestment. If illiquid securities exceed 15%\nof the Fund\u2019s net assets, certain remedial\nactions will be taken as required by Rule\n22e-4 under the 1940 Act and the Fund\u2019s\npolicies and procedures.\n\nINFLATION-PROTECTED OBLIGATIONS\n\nThe Fund may invest in inflation-protected\nobligations, commonly known as \u201cTIPS,\u201d of the\nU.S. Treasury, as well as TIPS of major\ngovernments and emerging market countries,\nexcluding the United States. TIPS are a type\nof security issued by a government that are\ndesigned to provide inflation protection to\ninvestors. TIPS are income-generating\ninstruments whose interest and principal\npayments are adjusted for inflation\u2014a\nsustained increase in prices that erodes the\npurchasing power of money. The inflation\nadjustment, which is typically applied monthly\nto the principal of the bond, follows a\ndesignated inflation index, such as the\nConsumer Price Index. A fixed coupon rate is\napplied to the inflation-adjusted principal so\nthat as inflation rises or falls, both the\nprincipal value and the interest payments will\nincrease or decrease. This can provide\ninvestors with a hedge against inflation, as\nit helps preserve the purchasing power of an\ninvestment. Because of this inflation\nadjustment feature, inflation-protected bonds\ntypically have lower yields than conventional\nfixed-rate bonds.\n                      10                      \nINVESTMENT COMPANIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in the securities of other\ninvestment companies, including affiliated\nfunds and money market funds, subject to\napplicable limitations under Section 12(d)(1)\nof the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Section 12(d)(1),\nthe Fund may invest in the securities of\nanother investment company (the \u201cacquired\ncompany\u201d) provided that the Fund, immediately\nafter such purchase or acquisition, does not\nown in the aggregate: (i) more than 3% of the\ntotal outstanding voting stock of the acquired\ncompany; (ii) securities issued by the\nacquired company having an aggregate value in\nexcess of 5% of the value of the total assets\nof the Fund; or (iii) securities issued by the\nacquired company and all other investment\ncompanies (other than Treasury stock of the\nFund) having an aggregate value in excess of\n10% of the value of the total assets of the\nFund. To the extent allowed by law,\nregulation, the Fund\u2019s investment restrictions\nand the Trust\u2019s exemptive relief, the Fund may\ninvest its assets in securities of investment\ncompanies, including affiliated funds and/or\nmoney market funds in excess of the limits\ndiscussed above.\n\nIf the Fund invests in and, thus, is a\nshareholder of, another investment company,\nthe Fund\u2019s shareholders will indirectly bear\nthe Fund\u2019s proportionate share of the fees and\nexpenses paid by such other investment\ncompany, including advisory fees, in addition\nto both the management fees payable directly\nby the Fund to the Fund\u2019s own investment\nadviser and the other expenses that the Fund\nbears directly in connection with the Fund\u2019s\nown operations.\n\nLENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may lend portfolio securities to\ncertain creditworthy borrowers in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. markets in an amount not to exceed\n40% of the value of its net assets. The\nborrowers provide collateral that is marked to\nmarket daily in an amount at least equal to\nthe current market value of the securities\nloaned. The Fund may terminate a loan at any\ntime and obtain the securities loaned. The\nFund receives the value of any interest or\ncash or non-cash distributions paid on the\nloaned securities. The Fund cannot vote\nproxies for securities on loan, but may recall\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the Fund\u2019s economic interest in the\ninvestment is to be voted upon. Efforts to\nrecall such securities promptly may be\nunsuccessful, especially for foreign\nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and\nmay involve expenses to the Fund.\nDistributions received on loaned securities in\nlieu of dividend payments (i.e., substitute\npayments) would not be considered qualified\ndividend income.\n\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower will be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. The Fund is compensated by the\ndifference between the amount earned on the\nreinvestment of cash collateral and the fee\npaid to the borrower. In the case of\ncollateral other than cash, the Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of\nthe loaned securities. Any cash collateral may\nbe reinvested in certain high quality short-\nterm instruments either directly on behalf of\nthe Fund or through one or more joint accounts\nor funds, which may include those managed by\nthe Adviser. The Fund could lose money due to\na decline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or any investments made\nwith cash collateral. Certain non-cash\ncollateral or investments made with cash\ncollateral may have a greater risk of loss\nthan other non-cash collateral or investments.\n\nThe Fund may pay a portion of the interest or\nfees earned from securities lending to a\nborrower as described above, and to one or\nmore securities lending agents approved by the\nBoard of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d)\nwho administer the lending program for the\nFund in accordance with guidelines approved by\nthe Board. In such capacity, the lending agent\nprovides the following services to the Fund in\nconnection with the Fund\u2019s securities lending\nactivities: (i) locating borrowers among an\napproved list of prospective borrowers; (ii)\ncausing the delivery of loaned securities from\nthe Fund to borrowers; (iii) monitoring the\nvalue of loaned securities, the value of\ncollateral received, and other lending\nparameters; (iv) seeking additional\ncollateral, as necessary, from borrowers; (v)\nreceiving and holding collateral from\nborrowers, and facilitating the investment and\nreinvestment of all or substantially all cash\ncollateral in an investment vehicle designated\nby the Fund; (vi) returning collateral to\nborrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute\ndividend, interest, and other distribution\npayments to the Fund from borrowers; (viii)\nnegotiating the terms of each loan of\nsecurities, including but not limited to the\namount of any loan premium, and monitoring the\nterms of securities loan agreements with\nprospective borrowers for consistency with the\nrequirements of the Fund\u2019s Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement; (ix) selecting\nsecurities, including amounts (percentages),\nto be loaned; (x) recordkeeping and accounting\nservicing; and (xi) arranging for return of\nloaned securities to the Fund in accordance\nwith the terms of the Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement. State Street Bank and\nTrust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d), an affiliate\nof the Trust, has been approved by the Board\nto serve as securities lending agent for the\nFund and the Trust has entered into an\nagreement with State Street for such services.\nAmong other matters, the Trust has agreed to\nindemnify State Street for certain\nliabilities. State Street has received an\norder of exemption from the SEC under Sections\n17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the 1940 Act to serve\nas the lending agent for affiliated investment\ncompanies such as the Trust and to invest the\ncash collateral received from loan\ntransactions to be invested in an affiliated\ncash collateral fund.\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess especially so in certain international\nmarkets such as Taiwan), \u201cgap\u201d risk (i.e., the\nrisk of a mismatch between the return on cash\ncollateral reinvestments and the fees the Fund\nhas agreed to pay a borrower), risk of loss of\ncollateral, credit, legal, counterparty and\nmarket risk. If a securities lending\ncounterparty were to default, the Fund would\nbe subject to\n                      11                      \nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return the Fund\u2019s securities as agreed,\nthe Fund may experience losses if the proceeds\nreceived from liquidating the collateral do\nnot at least equal the value of the loaned\nsecurity at the time the collateral is\nliquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nAlthough State Street has agreed to provide\nthe Fund with indemnification in the event of\na borrower default, the Fund is still exposed\nto the risk of losses in the event a borrower\ndoes not return the Fund\u2019s securities as\nagreed. For example, delays in recovery of\nlent securities may cause the Fund to lose the\nopportunity to sell the securities at a\ndesirable price.\n\nLEVERAGING\n\nWhile the Fund does not anticipate doing so,\nthe Fund may borrow money in an amount greater\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets. However, under normal circumstances,\nthe Fund will not borrow money from a bank in\nan amount greater than 10% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s total assets. Borrowing for investment\npurposes is one form of leverage. Leveraging\ninvestments, by purchasing securities with\nborrowed money, is a speculative technique\nthat increases investment risk, but also\nincreases investment opportunity. Because\nsubstantially all of the Fund\u2019s assets will\nfluctuate in value, whereas the interest\nobligations on borrowings may be fixed, the\nNAV of the Fund will increase more when the\nFund\u2019s portfolio assets increase in value and\ndecrease more when the Fund\u2019s portfolio assets\ndecrease in value than would otherwise be the\ncase. Moreover, interest costs on borrowings\nmay fluctuate with changing market rates of\ninterest and may partially offset or exceed\nthe returns on the borrowed funds.\n\nOTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser),\ncash and cash equivalents, on an ongoing basis\nto provide liquidity or for other reasons.\nMoney market instruments are generally short-\nterm investments that may include but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by the Adviser); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit\n(\u201cCDs\u201d), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nforeign banks (including foreign branches) and\nsimilar institutions; (iv) commercial paper\nrated at the date of purchase \u201cPrime-1\u201d by\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) or \u201cA-1\u201d\nby Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d), or if unrated,\nof comparable quality as determined by the\nAdviser; (v) non-convertible corporate debt\nsecurities (e.g., bonds and debentures) with\nremaining maturities at the date of purchase\nof not more than 397 days and that present\nminimal credit risks; and (vi) short-term U.S.\ndollar-denominated obligations of foreign\nbanks (including U.S. branches) that, in the\nopinion of the Adviser, are of comparable\nquality to obligations of U.S. banks which may\nbe purchased by the Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or a\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u2019 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in connection with\ninternational transactions. Money market\ninstruments also include shares of money\nmarket funds. The SEC and other government\nagencies continue to review the regulation of\nmoney market funds. The SEC has adopted\nchanges to the rules that govern money market\nfunds, and compliance with many of these\namendments was required in October 2016.\nLegislative developments may also affect money\nmarket funds. These changes and developments\nmay affect the investment strategies,\nperformance, yield, operating expenses and\ncontinued viability of a money market fund.\n\nPRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND RESTRICTED SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in securities that are\npurchased in private placements and,\naccordingly, are subject to restrictions on\nresale as a matter of contract or under\nfederal securities laws. While such private\nplacements may offer attractive opportunities\nfor investment not otherwise available on the\nopen market, the securities so purchased are\noften \u201crestricted securities,\u201d i.e.,\nsecurities which cannot be sold to the public\nwithout registration under the Securities Act\nor the availability of an exemption from\nregistration (such as Rules 144 or 144A), or\nwhich are not readily marketable because they\nare subject to other legal or contractual\ndelays in or restrictions on resale. Generally\nspeaking, restricted securities may be sold\nonly to qualified institutional buyers, or in\na privately negotiated transaction to a\nlimited number of purchasers, or in limited\nquantities after they have been held for a\nspecified period of time and other conditions\nare met pursuant to an exemption from\nregistration, or in a public offering for\nwhich a registration statement is in effect\nunder the Securities Act.\n\nBecause there may be relatively few potential\npurchasers for such investments, especially\nunder adverse market or economic conditions or\nin the event of adverse changes in the\nfinancial condition of the issuer, the Fund\ncould find it more difficult to sell such\nsecurities when the Adviser believes it\nadvisable to do so or may be able to sell such\nsecurities only at prices lower than if such\nsecurities were more widely held. Market\nquotations for such securities are generally\nless readily available than for publicly\ntraded securities. The absence of a trading\nmarket can make it difficult to ascertain a\nmarket value for such securities for purposes\nof computing the Fund\u2019s net asset value, and\nthe judgment of the Adviser may at times play\na greater role in valuing these securities\nthan in the case of publicly traded\nsecurities. Disposing of such securities,\nwhich may be illiquid investments, can involve\ntime-consuming negotiation and legal expenses,\nand it may be difficult or impossible for the\nFund to sell them promptly at an acceptable\nprice. The Fund may have to bear the extra\nexpense of registering such securities for\nresale and the risk of substantial delay in\neffecting such registration.\n                      12                      \nThe Fund may be deemed to be an \u201cunderwriter\u201d\nfor purposes of the Securities Act when\nselling restricted securities to the public,\nand in such event the Fund may be liable to\npurchasers of such securities if the\nregistration statement prepared by the issuer,\nor the prospectus forming a part of it, is\nmaterially inaccurate or misleading.\n\nRATINGS\n\nAn investment-grade rating means the security\nor issuer is rated investment-grade by\nMoody\u2019s, S&P, Fitch, Inc. (\u201cFitch\u201d), Dominion\nBond Rating Service Limited, or another credit\nrating agency designated as a nationally\nrecognized statistical rating organization by\nthe SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of\nequivalent quality by the Adviser.\n\nSubsequent to purchase by the Fund, a rated\nsecurity may cease to be rated or its\ninvestment-grade rating may be reduced below\nan investment-grade rating. Bonds rated lower\nthan Baa3 by Moody\u2019s or BBB- by S&P or Fitch\nare below investment-grade quality and are\nobligations of issuers that are considered\npredominantly speculative with respect to the\nissuer\u2019s capacity to pay interest and repay\nprincipal according to the terms of the\nobligation and, therefore, carry greater\ninvestment risk, including the possibility of\nissuer default and bankruptcy and increased\nmarket price volatility. Such securities\n(\u201clower rated securities\u201d) are commonly\nreferred to as \u201cjunk bonds\u201d and are subject to\na substantial degree of credit risk. Lower\nrated securities are often issued by smaller,\nless creditworthy companies or by highly\nleveraged (indebted) firms, which are\ngenerally less able than more financially\nstable firms to make scheduled payments of\ninterest and principal. The risks posed by\nsecurities issued under such circumstances are\nsubstantial. Bonds rated below investment-\ngrade tend to be less marketable than higher-\nquality bonds because the market for them is\nless broad. The market for unrated bonds is\neven narrower. See \u201cHIGH YIELD SECURITIES\u201d\nabove for more information relating to the\nrisks associated with investing in lower rated\nsecurities, or Appendix C for more information\non the ratings of debt instruments.\n\nREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in repurchase agreements\nwith commercial banks, brokers or dealers to\ngenerate income from its excess cash balances\nand to invest securities lending cash\ncollateral. A repurchase agreement is an\nagreement under which the Fund acquires a\nfinancial instrument (e.g., a security issued\nby the U.S. government or an agency thereof, a\nbanker\u2019s acceptance or a certificate of\ndeposit) from a seller, subject to resale to\nthe seller at an agreed upon price and date\n(normally, the next Business Day \u2013 as defined\nbelow). A repurchase agreement may be\nconsidered a loan collateralized by\nsecurities. The resale price reflects an\nagreed upon interest rate effective for the\nperiod the instrument is held by the Fund and\nis unrelated to the interest rate on the\nunderlying instrument.\n\nIn these repurchase agreement transactions,\nthe securities acquired by the Fund (including\naccrued interest earned thereon) must have a\ntotal value in excess of the value of the\nrepurchase agreement and are held by the\nCustodian until repurchased. No more than an\naggregate of 15% of the Fund\u2019s net assets will\nbe invested in illiquid securities, including\nrepurchase agreements having maturities longer\nthan seven days and securities subject to\nlegal or contractual restrictions on resale,\nor for which there are no readily available\nmarket quotations.\n\nThe use of repurchase agreements involves\ncertain risks. For example, if the other party\nto the agreement defaults on its obligation to\nrepurchase the underlying security at a time\nwhen the value of the security has declined,\nthe Fund may incur a loss upon disposition of\nthe security. If the other party to the\nagreement becomes insolvent and subject to\nliquidation or reorganization under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or other laws, a court may\ndetermine that the underlying security is\ncollateral for a loan by the Fund not within\nthe control of the Fund and, therefore, the\nFund may not be able to substantiate its\ninterest in the underlying security and may be\ndeemed an unsecured creditor of the other\nparty to the agreement.\n\nREVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements, which involve the sale of\nsecurities with an agreement to repurchase the\nsecurities at an agreed-upon price, date and\ninterest payment and have the characteristics\nof borrowing. The securities purchased with\nthe funds obtained from the agreement and\nsecurities collateralizing the agreement will\nhave maturity dates no later than the\nrepayment date. Generally the effect of such\ntransactions is that the Fund can recover all\nor most of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to keep some of the\ninterest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are only\nadvantageous if the Fund has an opportunity to\nearn a greater rate of interest on the cash\nderived from these transactions than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available and the Fund intends to\nuse the reverse repurchase technique only when\nthe Adviser believes it will be advantageous\nto\n                      13                      \nthe Fund. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements may exaggerate any interim increase\nor decrease in the value of the Fund\u2019s assets.\nThe Fund\u2019s exposure to reverse repurchase\nagreements will be covered by securities\nhaving a value equal to or greater than such\ncommitments. Under the 1940 Act, reverse\nrepurchase agreements are considered\nborrowings. Although there is no percentage\nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nthe Fund does not expect to engage, under\nnormal circumstances, in reverse repurchase\nagreements with respect to more than 10% of\nits total assets.\n\nSOVEREIGN DEBT OBLIGATIONS\n\nSovereign debt obligations are issued or\nguaranteed by foreign governments or their\nagencies. Sovereign debt may be in the form of\nconventional securities or other types of debt\ninstruments such as loans or loan\nparticipations. Governmental entities\nresponsible for repayment of the debt may be\nunable or unwilling to repay principal and pay\ninterest when due, and may require\nrenegotiation or reschedule of debt payments.\nIn addition, prospects for repayment of\nprincipal and payment of interest may depend\non political as well as economic factors.\nAlthough some sovereign debt, such as Brady\nBonds, is collateralized by U.S. Government\nsecurities, repayment of principal and payment\nof interest is not guaranteed by the U.S.\nGovernment.\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nU.S. Government obligations are a type of\nbond. U.S. Government obligations include\nsecurities issued or guaranteed as to\nprincipal and interest by the U.S. Government,\nits agencies or instrumentalities.\n\nOne type of U.S. Government obligation, U.S.\nTreasury obligations, are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. Treasury and\ndiffer only in their interest rates,\nmaturities, and times of issuance. U.S.\nTreasury bills have initial maturities of one-\nyear or less; U.S. Treasury notes have initial\nmaturities of one to ten years; and U.S.\nTreasury bonds generally have initial\nmaturities of greater than ten years.\n\nOther U.S. Government obligations are issued\nor guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities\nof the U.S. Government including, but not\nlimited to, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), the Government\nNational Mortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d),\nthe Small Business Administration, the Federal\nFarm Credit Administration, the Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d), the\nFederal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLB\u201d), Banks for\nCooperatives (including the Central Bank for\nCooperatives), the Federal Land Banks, the\nFederal Intermediate Credit Banks, the\nTennessee Valley Authority, the Export-Import\nBank of the United States, the Commodity\nCredit Corporation, the Federal Financing\nBank, the Student Loan Marketing Association,\nthe National Credit Union Administration and\nthe Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation\n(Farmer Mac). Some obligations issued or\nguaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and\ninstrumentalities, including, for example,\nGinnie Mae pass-through certificates, are\nsupported by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. Treasury. Other obligations issued by or\nguaranteed by federal agencies, such as those\nsecurities issued by Fannie Mae, are supported\nby the discretionary authority of the U.S.\nGovernment to purchase certain obligations of\nthe federal agency, while other obligations\nissued by or guaranteed by federal agencies,\nsuch as those of the Federal Home Loan Banks,\nare supported by the right of the issuer to\nborrow from the U.S. Treasury. While the U.S.\nGovernment provides financial support to such\nU.S. Government-sponsored federal agencies, no\nassurance can be given that the U.S.\nGovernment will always do so, since the U.S.\nGovernment is not so obligated by law.\n\nIn September 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced\na federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac, placing the two federal instrumentalities\nin conservatorship. Under the terms of the\ntakeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed to acquire\n$1 billion of senior preferred stock of each\ninstrumentality and obtained warrants for the\npurchase of common stock of each\ninstrumentality. Under these Senior Preferred\nStock Purchase Agreements (\u201cSPAs\u201d), the U.S.\nTreasury has pledged to provide a limited\namount of capital per instrumentality as\nneeded, including the contribution of cash\ncapital to the instrumentalities in the event\ntheir liabilities exceed their assets. In May\n2009, the U.S. Treasury increased its maximum\ncommitment to each instrumentality under the\nSPAs from $100 billion to $200 billion per\ninstrumentality. In December 2009, the U.S.\nTreasury amended the SPAs to provide Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac with some additional\nflexibility to meet the requirement to reduce\ntheir mortgage portfolios. Also in December\n2009, the U.S. Treasury further amended the\nSPAs to allow the cap on the U.S. Treasury\u2019s\nfunding commitment to increase as necessary to\naccommodate any cumulative reduction in Fannie\nMae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s net worth through the\nend of 2012. On August 17, 2012, the U.S.\nTreasury announced that it was again amending\nthe SPAs to terminate the requirement that\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac each pay a 10%\ndividend annually on all amounts received\nunder the funding commitment. Instead, they\nwere required to transfer to the U.S. Treasury\non a quarterly basis all profits earned during\na quarter that exceeded a capital reserve\namount of $3 billion. On September 30, 2019,\nthe U.S. Treasury announced amendments to the\nSPAs permitting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to\nmaintain capital reserves of $25 billion and\n$20 billion, respectively. It is believed that\nthe amendment puts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nin a better position to service their debt\nbecause the companies no longer have to borrow\nfrom the U.S. Treasury to make fixed dividend\npayments.\n                      14                      \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the subject of\nseveral continuing class action lawsuits and\ninvestigations by federal regulators over\ncertain accounting, disclosure or corporate\ngovernance matters, which (along with any\nresulting financial restatements) may\nadversely affect the guaranteeing entities.\nImportantly, the future of the entities is in\nserious question as the U.S. government\nreportedly is considering multiple options,\nranging from nationalization, privatization,\nconsolidation, or abolishment of the entities.\n\nVARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES\n\nVariable rate securities are instruments\nissued or guaranteed by entities such as (1)\nUS Government, or an agency or instrumentality\nthereof, (2) states, municipalities and other\npolitical subdivisions, agencies, authorities\nand instrumentalities or states and multi-\nstate agencies or authorities (3)\ncorporations, (4) financial institutions, (5)\ninsurance companies or (6) trusts that have a\nrate of interest subject to adjustment at\nregular intervals but less frequently than\nannually. A variable rate security provides\nfor the automatic establishment of a new\ninterest rate on set dates. Variable rate\nobligations whose interest is readjusted no\nless frequently than annually will be deemed\nto have a maturity equal to the period\nremaining until the next readjustment of the\ninterest rate. The Fund may also purchase\nfloating rate securities. A floating rate\nsecurity provides for the automatic adjustment\nof its interest rate whenever a specified\ninterest rate changes. Interest rates on these\nsecurities are ordinarily tied to, and are a\npercentage of, a widely recognized interest\nrate, such as the yield on 90-day US Treasury\nbills or the prime rate of a specified bank.\nThese rates may change as often as twice\ndaily. Generally, changes in interest rates\nwill have a smaller effect on the market value\nof variable and fixed rate floating rate\nsecurities than on the market value of\ncomparable fixed rate fixed income\nobligations. Thus, investing in variable and\nfixed rate floating rate securities generally\nallows less opportunity for capital\nappreciation and depreciation than investing\nin comparable fixed rate fixed income\nsecurities.\n                                              \n       SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS       \n                                              \nA discussion of the risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. The discussion below supplements,\nand should be read in conjunction with, the\nProspectus.\n\nGENERAL\n\nInvestment in the Fund should be made with an\nunderstanding that the value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities may fluctuate in\naccordance with changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuers of the portfolio\nsecurities, the value of securities generally\nand other factors.\n\nAn investment in the Fund should also be made\nwith an understanding of the risks inherent in\nan investment in securities, including the\nrisk that the financial condition of issuers\nmay become impaired or that the general\ncondition of the securities markets may\ndeteriorate (either of which may cause a\ndecrease in the value of the portfolio\nsecurities and thus in the value of Shares).\nSecurities are susceptible to general market\nfluctuations and to volatile increases and\ndecreases in value as market confidence in and\nperceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and\nfiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic and banking\ncrises. Securities of issuers traded on\nexchanges may be suspended on certain\nexchanges by the issuers themselves, by an\nexchange or by government authorities. The\nlikelihood of such suspensions may be higher\nfor securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than in countries\nwith more developed markets. Trading\nsuspensions may be applied from time to time\nto the securities of individual issuers for\nreasons specific to that issuer, or may be\napplied broadly by exchanges or governmental\nauthorities in response to market events.\nSuspensions may last for significant periods\nof time, during which trading in the\nsecurities and instruments that reference the\nsecurities, such as participatory notes (or\n\u201cP-notes\u201d) or other derivative instruments,\nmay be halted.\n\nHolders of common stock incur more risk than\nholders of preferred stocks and debt\nobligations because common stockholders, as\nowners of the issuer, have generally inferior\nrights to receive payments from the issuer in\ncomparison with the rights of creditors of, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks issued by, the issuer. Further, unlike\ndebt securities which typically have a stated\nprincipal amount payable at maturity (whose\nvalue, however, will be subject to market\nfluctuations prior thereto), or preferred\nstocks which typically have a liquidation\npreference and which may have stated optional\nor mandatory redemption provisions, common\nstock have neither a fixed principal amount\nnor a maturity. Common stock values are\nsubject to market fluctuations as long as the\ncommon stock remains outstanding.\n\nThe principal trading market for some of the\nsecurities in the Index may be in the over-\nthe-counter market. The existence of a liquid\ntrading market for certain securities may\ndepend on whether dealers will make a market\nin such securities. There can be no assurance\nthat a market will be made or maintained or\nthat any such market will be or remain liquid.\nThe price at which securities may be sold and\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s Shares will be\nadversely affected if trading markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities are limited or\nabsent or if bid/ask spreads are wide.\n                      15                      \nCHINA BOND RISK\n\nThe Fund may invest in renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d)\ndenominated fixed income securities of Chinese\nissuers (\u201cChina bonds\u201d). To the extent the\nFund\u2019s underlying Index includes China bonds,\nthe Fund\u2019s ability to achieve its investment\nobjective is dependent on its continued access\nto such bonds. The Fund may invest in China\nbonds (i) through direct access to the China\nInterbank Bond Market (\u201cCIBM\u201d), (ii) through\ncertain foreign institutional investors that\nhave obtained a license from the Chinese\nregulators, and (iii) through Bond Connect, a\nprogram that provides foreign investors with\naccess to China\u2019s onshore bond market.\n\nCIBM Direct Access Program Risks. The CIBM is\nan OTC market established in 1997, and\naccounts for more than 95% of outstanding bond\nvalues of the total trading volume in the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (the \u201cPRC\u201d). On\nCIBM, domestic institutional investors and\ncertain foreign institutional investors can\ntrade, on a one-to-one quote-driven basis,\nsovereign bonds, government bonds, corporate\nbonds, bond repo, bond lending, bills issued\nby the People\u2019s Bank of China (\u201cPBOC\u201d) and\nother financial debt instruments. Pursuant to\nthe Announcement (2016) No. 3 issued by the\nPBOC on February 24, 2016, eligible foreign\ninstitutional investors can conduct trading on\nthe CIBM under a program established by the\nPBOC (\u201cCIBM Direct Access Program\u201d) subject to\nother rules and regulations as promulgated by\nthe PRC authorities. There is no trading quota\nlimitation.\n\nCIBM is regulated and supervised by the PBOC.\nThe PBOC is responsible for, among others,\npromulgating the applicable CIBM listing,\ntrading and operating rules, and supervising\nthe market operators of CIBM. Bonds and bond-\nrelated derivatives are traded in the CIBM\nprimarily through (i) independent bilateral\nnegotiation on a transaction by transaction\nbasis or (ii) through the \u201cclick-and-deal\u201d\ntrading model, whereby a party offers a quote\nin the market that can then be accepted by a\ncounterparty (thus, \u201cclicking\u201d the \u201cdeal\u201d). A\n\u201cclick-and-deal\u201d quote may also be\nautomatically matched with a price limit\norder. In addition, recently an \u201canonymous\nclick\u201d trading model has been implemented for\ncertain bonds and bond-related derivatives\nwhereby anonymous quotes offered in the market\nare automatically matched with counterparties\nbased on timing and price. Once a transaction\nis agreed upon, the parties will, in\naccordance with the terms of the transaction,\npromptly send instructions for the delivery of\nbonds and funds. Parties are required to have\nsufficient bonds and funds for delivery on the\nagreed upon delivery date. China Central\nDepository & Clearing Co., Ltd (\u201cCCDC\u201d) or\nShanghai Clearing House (\u201cSHCH\u201d) will deliver\nbonds according to the instructions sent by\nthe parties. Fund clearing banks will handle\nthe transfer and settlement of the payments of\nthe bonds on behalf of the parties. The China\nForeign Exchange Trading System is the unified\ntrading platform for CIBM.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investments in China bonds through\nthe CIBM Direct Access Program will be subject\nto a number of additional risks and\nrestrictions that may affect the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments and returns. Certain of these\nrisks are discussed below.\n\nThe CIBM Direct Access Program is relatively\nnew. Laws, rules, regulations, policies,\nnotices, circulars or guidelines relating to\nthe CIBM Direct Access Program as published or\napplied by the PBOC and other PRC authorities\nare relatively untested and are subject to\nchange from time to time. There can be no\nassurance that the CIBM Direct Access Program\nwill not be restricted, suspended or\nabolished. If such event occurs, the Fund\u2019s\nability to invest in the CIBM through the CIBM\nDirect Access Program will be adversely\naffected, and if the Fund is unable to\nadequately access the CIBM through other\nmeans, the Fund\u2019s ability to achieve its\ninvestment objective will be adversely\naffected.\n\nUnder the prevailing PRC regulations, eligible\nforeign institutional investors who wish to\ninvest directly in CIBM through the CIBM\nDirect Access Program may do so through an\nonshore settlement agent, who would be\nresponsible for making the relevant filings\nand account opening with the relevant\nauthorities. The Fund is therefore subject to\nthe risk of default or errors on the part of\nsuch agent.\n\nRQFII Investment Risk. Investment companies,\nsuch as the Fund, are not currently within the\ntypes of entities that are eligible for a\nRenminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional\nInvestor (\u201cRQFII\u201d) or Qualified Foreign\nInstitutional Investor (\u201cQFII\u201d) license.\nRather, the Fund may utilize the Adviser\u2019s\nRQFII license granted under RQFII regulations\nto invest in China bonds.\n\nIt is possible that the Adviser\u2019s RQFII status\ncould be suspended or revoked. Pursuant to PRC\nand RQFII regulations, the State\nAdministration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d)\nand the China Securities Regulatory Commission\n(\u201cCSRC\u201d) are vested with the power to impose\nregulatory sanctions if the Adviser, in its\ncapacity as RQFII, or the PRC custodian\nviolates any provision of the RQFII\nregulations. Any such violations could result\nin the revocation of the Adviser\u2019s RQFII\nlicense or other regulatory sanctions and may\nadversely affect the ability of the Fund to\ninvest in China bonds. The Adviser is also\nsubject to regulation by certain Hong Kong\nregulatory authorities, including the Hong\nKong Securities and Futures Commission.\nRegulatory matters arising from such\nregulation could also adversely affect the\nAdviser\u2019s RQFII license and ability to provide\nadvisory services, generally.\n                      16                      \nThere can be no assurance that the Adviser\nwill continue to maintain its RQFII status. In\nthe event the Adviser is unable to maintain\nits RQFII status, it may be necessary for the\nFund to limit or suspend creations of Creation\nUnits. In such event it is possible that the\ntrading price of the Fund\u2019s Shares on its\nExchange will be at a significant premium to\nthe NAV (which may also increase tracking\nerror of the Fund). In extreme circumstances,\nthe Fund may incur significant loss due to\nlimited investment capabilities, or may not be\nable fully to implement or pursue its\ninvestment objectives or strategies, due to\nRQFII investment restrictions, illiquidity of\nthe PRC securities markets, and delay or\ndisruption in execution of trades or in\nsettlement of trades.\n\nThe regulations which regulate investments by\nRQFIIs in the PRC and the repatriation of\ncapital from RQFII investments are relatively\nnew. The application and interpretation of\nsuch investment regulations are therefore\nrelatively untested and there is no certainty\nas to how they will be applied as the PRC\nauthorities and regulators have been given\nwide discretion in such investment regulations\nand there is no precedent or certainty as to\nhow such discretion may be exercised now or in\nthe future. Existing RQFII regulations may\nchange over time and new RQFII regulations may\nbe promulgated in the future and no assurance\ncan be given that any such changes will not\nadversely affect the Fund or its ability to\nachieve its investment objective.\n\nBond Connect Risks. The \u201cMutual Bond Market\nAccess between Mainland China and Hong Kong\u201d\n(\u201cBond Connect\u201d) program is a new initiative\nestablished by PBOC, China Foreign Exchange\nTrade System & National Interbank Funding\nCentre (\u201cCFETS\u201d), CCDC, SHCH, and Hong Kong\nExchanges and Clearing Limited (\u201cHKEx\u201d) and\nCentral Moneymarkets Unit (\u201cCMU\u201d) of the Hong\nKong Monetary Authority (\u201cHKMA\u201d) to facilitate\ninvestor\u2019s investments between the Mainland\nChina and Hong Kong bond markets through\nconnection between the Mainland China and Hong\nKong financial institutions.\n\nUnder the prevailing PRC regulations, eligible\nforeign investors are allowed to invest in the\nbonds available on the CIBM through the\nnorthbound trading of Bond Connect\n(\u201cNorthbound Trading Link\u201d). There is\ncurrently no investment quota for the\nNorthbound Trading Link. The Northbound\nTrading Link refers to the trading platform\nthat is located outside of Mainland China and\nis connected to CFETS for eligible foreign\ninvestors to submit their trade requests for\nbonds circulated in the CIBM through Bond\nConnect. HKEx and CFETS work together with\noffshore electronic bond trading platforms to\nprovide electronic trading services and\nplatforms to allow direct trading between\neligible foreign investors and approved\nonshore dealers in Mainland China through\nCFETS. Under the Northbound Trading Link,\neligible foreign investors are required to\nappoint the CFETS or other institutions\nrecognized by the PBOC as registration agents\nto apply for registration with the PBOC.\n\nPursuant to the prevailing regulations in\nMainland China, the CMU, the offshore custody\nagent recognized by the HKMA, opens omnibus\nnominee accounts with the onshore custody\nagent recognized by the PBOC (i.e., the CCDC\nand SHCH). All bonds traded by eligible\nforeign investors will be registered in the\nname of the CMU, which will hold such bonds as\na nominee owner.\n\nBond Connect is relatively new. Laws, rules,\nregulations, policies, notices, circulars or\nguidelines relating to Bond Connect as\npublished or applied by any of the Bond\nConnect Authorities (as defined below) are\nrelatively untested and are subject to change.\n\u201cBond Connect Authorities\u201d refers to the\nexchanges, trading systems, settlement\nsystems, governmental, regulatory or tax\nbodies which provide services and/or regulate\nBond Connect and activities relating to Bond\nConnect, including, without limitation, the\nPBOC, the HKMA, the HKEx, the CFETS, the CMU,\nthe CCDC and the SHCH and any other regulator,\nagency or authority with jurisdiction,\nauthority or responsibility in respect of Bond\nConnect. There can be no assurance that Bond\nConnect will not be restricted, suspended or\nabolished. If such event occurs, the Fund\u2019s\nability to invest in the CIBM through Bond\nConnect may be adversely affected, and if the\nFund is unable to adequately access the CIBM\nthrough other means, the Fund\u2019s ability to\nachieve its investment objective may be\nadversely affected.\n\nUnder the prevailing Bond Connect regulations,\neligible foreign investors who wish to\nparticipate in Bond Connect may do so through\nan offshore custody agent, registration agent\nor other third parties (as the case may be),\nwho would be responsible for making the\nrelevant filings and account opening with the\nrelevant authorities. The Fund is therefore\nsubject to the risk of default or errors on\nthe part of such agents.\n\nTrading through Bond Connect is performed\nthrough newly developed trading platforms and\noperational systems. There is no assurance\nthat such systems will function properly (in\nparticular, under extreme market conditions)\nor will continue to be adapted to changes and\ndevelopments in the market. In the event that\nthe relevant systems fail to function\nproperly, trading through Bond Connect may be\ndisrupted. The Fund\u2019s ability to trade through\nBond Connect (and hence to pursue its\ninvestment strategy) may therefore be\nadversely affected. In addition, where the\nFund invests in the CIBM through Bond Connect,\nit may be subject to risks of delays inherent\nin the order placing and/or settlement.\n\nThe CMU is the \u201cnominee holder\u201d of the bonds\nacquired by the Fund through Bond Connect.\nWhile Bond Connect Authorities have expressly\nstated that investors will enjoy the rights\nand interests of the bonds acquired through\nBond Connect similar to investors in bond\ninterests acquired through more traditional\nmeans in accordance with applicable laws, the\nexercise and the enforcement of beneficial\nownership rights in such bonds in the Chinese\ncourts has yet to be tested. As a result, for\nexample, though the HKMA has\n                      17                      \nstated otherwise in its Frequently Asked\nQuestions relating to Bond Connect, it is\npossible that in the event that the nominee\nholder becomes insolvent, such bonds may be\ndeemed to form part of the pool of assets of\nthe nominee holder available for distribution\nto its creditors thereby subjugating the\nrights of the Fund.\n\nChinese Credit Rating Risks. China bonds will\ngenerally be rated by Chinese ratings agencies\n(and not by U.S. nationally recognized\nstatistical ratings organizations (\u201cNRSROs\u201d)).\nThe rating criteria and methodology used by\nChinese rating agencies may be different from\nthose adopted by NRSROs and international\ncredit rating agencies. Therefore, such rating\nsystems may not provide an equivalent standard\nfor comparison with securities rated by NRSROs\nand international credit rating agencies.\n\nMarket Risks. The Fund investing in the CIBM\nwill be subject to liquidity and volatility\nrisks. Market volatility and potential lack of\nliquidity due to possible low trading volume\nof certain bonds in the CIBM may result in\nprices of certain bonds traded in the CIBM\nfluctuating significantly. The bid and offer\nspreads of the prices of such bonds may be\nlarge, and the Fund may therefore incur\nsignificant trading and realization costs and\nmay even suffer losses when selling such\ninvestments. To the extent that the Fund\ntransacts in the CIBM, the Fund may also be\nexposed to risks associated with settlement\nprocedures and default of counterparties. The\ncounterparty which has entered into a\ntransaction with the Fund may default in its\nobligation to settle the transaction by\nfailure to deliver relevant securities or to\nmake payment.\n                                              \n  GeneralPRC-RelatedRisks                     \n                                              \nEconomic, Political and Social Risks of the\nPRC. The economy of China, which has been in a\nstate of transition from a planned economy to\na more market oriented economy, differs from\nthe economies of most developed countries in\nmany respects, including the level of\ngovernment involvement, its state of\ndevelopment, its growth rate, control of\nforeign exchange, protection of intellectual\nproperty rights and allocation of resources.\n\nAlthough the majority of productive assets in\nChina are still owned by the PRC government at\nvarious levels, in recent years, the PRC\ngovernment has implemented economic reform\nmeasures emphasizing utilization of market\nforces in the development of the economy of\nChina and a high level of management autonomy.\nThe economy of China has experienced\nsignificant growth in the past several\ndecades, but growth has been uneven both\ngeographically and among various sectors of\nthe economy, and no assurance can be given\nthat such growth will continue. Economic\ngrowth has also been accompanied by periods of\nhigh inflation. The PRC government has\nimplemented various measures from time to time\nto control inflation and restrain the rate of\neconomic growth.\n\nThere can, however, be no assurance that the\nPRC government will continue to pursue such\neconomic policies or, if it does, that those\npolicies will continue to be successful. Any\nsuch adjustment and modification of those\neconomic policies may have an adverse impact\non the securities markets in the PRC as well\nas the portfolio securities of the Fund.\nFurther, the PRC government may from time to\ntime adopt corrective measures to control the\ngrowth of the PRC economy, which may also have\nan adverse impact on the capital growth and\nperformance of the Fund. Political changes,\nsocial instability and adverse diplomatic\ndevelopments in the PRC could result in the\nimposition of additional government\nrestrictions, including expropriation of\nassets, confiscatory taxes, limits on\nrepatriation, or nationalization of some or\nall of the property held by the underlying\nissuers of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.\n\nPRC Laws and Regulations Risk. The regulatory\nand legal framework for capital markets and\ncompanies in the PRC may not be as well\ndeveloped as those of developed countries. PRC\nlaws and regulations affecting securities\nmarkets are relatively new and evolving, and\nbecause of the limited volume of published\ncases and judicial interpretation and their\nnon-binding nature, interpretation and\nenforcement of these regulations involve\nsignificant uncertainties. In addition, as the\nPRC legal system develops, no assurance can be\ngiven that changes in such laws and\nregulations or new laws, regulations or\npractices relating to transactions in Chinese\nsecurities will be promulgated, or that their\ninterpretation or enforcement will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities.\n\nPRC Tax Risk. Uncertainties in PRC tax rules\ngoverning taxation of income and gains from\ninvestments in China bonds could result in\nunexpected tax liabilities for the Fund. The\nFund\u2019s investments in China bonds may cause\nthe Fund to become subject to withholding and\nother taxes imposed by the PRC. The Ministry\nof Finance of the PRC and the State\nAdministration of Taxation of the PRC issued\nCaishui No. 108 on November 7, 2018, which\nstates that bond interests derived from\ninvestment in the China bond market (including\nthrough CIBM, a RQFII/QFII license or Bond\nConnect) by foreign investors will be\ntemporarily exempt from withholding income tax\nand value added tax. The temporary exemption\nwill remain in effect until November 6, 2021.\nIf, in the future, China begins applying tax\nrules regarding the taxation of investment in\nChina bonds by foreign investors, and/or\nbegins collecting withholding and other taxes\non interest derived by such investment, the\nFund\u2019s return might be adversely affected.\n                      18                      \nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK\n\nAn investment in the Fund may be subject to a\nnumber of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest. For example, the Adviser or its\naffiliates may provide services to the Fund,\nsuch as securities lending agency services,\ncustodial, administrative, bookkeeping, and\naccounting services, transfer agency and\nshareholder servicing, securities brokerage\nservices, and other services for which the\nFund would compensate the Adviser and/or such\naffiliates. The Fund may invest in other\npooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed,\nor otherwise affiliated with the Adviser.\nThere is no assurance that the rates at which\nthe Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser\nor its affiliates, or the terms on which it\nenters into transactions with the Adviser or\nits affiliates, will be the most favorable\navailable in the market generally or as\nfavorable as the rates the Adviser makes\navailable to other clients. Because of its\nfinancial interest, the Adviser may have an\nincentive to enter into transactions or\narrangements on behalf of the Fund with itself\nor its affiliates in circumstances where it\nmight not have done so in the absence of that\ninterest.\n\nCONTINUOUS OFFERING\n\nThe method by which Creation Units of Shares\nare created and traded may raise certain\nissues under applicable securities laws.\nBecause new Creation Units of Shares are\nissued and sold by the Trust on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u201cdistribution,\u201d as such\nterm is used in the Securities Act, may occur.\nBroker-dealers and other persons are cautioned\nthat some activities on their part may,\ndepending on the circumstances, result in\ntheir being deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner which could render\nthem statutory underwriters and subject them\nto the prospectus delivery and liability\nprovisions of the Securities Act.\n\nFor example, a broker-dealer firm or its\nclient may be deemed a statutory underwriter\nif it takes Creation Units after placing an\norder with the Distributor, breaks them down\ninto constituent Shares, and sells such Shares\ndirectly to customers, or if it chooses to\ncouple the creation of a supply of new Shares\nwith an active selling effort involving\nsolicitation of secondary market demand for\nShares. A determination of whether one is an\nunderwriter for purposes of the Securities Act\nmust take into account all the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case, and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an underwriter.\n\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201cunderwriters\u201d but are\neffecting transactions in Shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nShares, are generally required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\nSecurities Act is not available in respect of\nsuch transactions as a result of Section 24(d)\nof the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a\nprospectus-delivery obligation with respect to\nShares of the Fund are reminded that under\nSecurities Act Rule 153, a prospectus-delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the\nSecurities Act owed to an exchange member in\nconnection with a sale on the Exchange is\nsatisfied by the fact that the Fund\u2019s\nProspectus is available at the Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism\nprovided in Rule 153 is only available with\nrespect to transactions on an exchange.\n\nSSGA or its affiliates (the \u201cSelling\nShareholder\u201d) may purchase Creation Units\nthrough a broker-dealer to \u201cseed\u201d (in whole or\nin part) the Fund as it is launched, or may\npurchase shares from broker-dealers or other\ninvestors that have previously provided \u201cseed\u201d\nfor the Fund when it was launched or otherwise\nin secondary market transactions, and because\nthe Selling Shareholder may be deemed an\naffiliate of the Fund, the Shares are being\nregistered to permit the resale of these\nshares from time to time after purchase. The\nFund will not receive any of the proceeds from\nthe resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese Shares.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder intends to sell all or\na portion of the Shares owned by it and\noffered hereby from time to time directly or\nthrough one or more broker-dealers, and may\nalso hedge such positions. The Shares may be\nsold on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the Shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, in the over-the-counter\nmarket or in transactions other than on these\nexchanges or systems at fixed prices, at\nprevailing market prices at the time of the\nsale, at varying prices determined at the time\nof sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales\nmay be effected in transactions, which may\ninvolve cross or block transactions.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder may also loan or\npledge Shares to broker-dealers that in turn\nmay sell such Shares, to the extent permitted\nby applicable law. The Selling Shareholder may\nalso enter into options or other transactions\nwith broker-dealers or other financial\ninstitutions or the creation of one or more\nderivative securities which require the\ndelivery to such broker-dealer or other\nfinancial institution of Shares, which Shares\nsuch broker-dealer or other financial\ninstitution may resell.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer\nor agents participating in the distribution of\nShares may be deemed to be \u201cunderwriters\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(11) of the\nSecurities Act in connection with such sales.\nIn such event, any commissions paid to any\nsuch broker-dealer or agent and any profit on\nthe resale of the Shares purchased by them may\nbe deemed to be underwriting commissions or\ndiscounts under the Securities Act. The\nSelling Shareholder who may be deemed an\n\u201cunderwriter\u201d within the meaning of Section\n2(11) of the Securities Act will be subject to\nthe applicable prospectus delivery\nrequirements of the Securities Act.\n                      19                      \nCOUNTERPARTY RISK\n\nCounterparty risk with respect to derivatives\nhas been and may continue to be affected by\nnew rules and regulations affecting the\nderivatives market. Some derivatives\ntransactions are required to be centrally\ncleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives\ntransaction is subject to the credit risk of\nthe clearing house and the clearing member\nthrough which it holds its cleared position,\nrather than the credit risk of its original\ncounterparty to the derivatives transaction.\nCredit risk of market participants with\nrespect to derivatives that are centrally\ncleared is concentrated in a few clearing\nhouses, and it is not clear how an insolvency\nproceeding of a clearing house would be\nconducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by the\nFund, and what impact an insolvency of a\nclearing house would have on the financial\nsystem more generally.\n\nFUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS\n\nThere can be no assurance that a liquid\nsecondary market will exist for any particular\nfutures contract or option at any specific\ntime. Thus, it may not be possible to close a\nfutures or options position. In the event of\nadverse price movements, the Fund would\ncontinue to be required to make daily cash\npayments to maintain its required margin. In\nsuch situations, if the Fund has insufficient\ncash, it may have to sell portfolio securities\nto meet daily margin requirements at a time\nwhen it may be disadvantageous to do so. In\naddition, the Fund may be required to make\ndelivery of the instruments underlying futures\ncontracts it has sold.\n\nThe Fund will minimize the risk that it will\nbe unable to close out a futures or options\ncontract by only entering into futures and\noptions for which there appears to be a liquid\nsecondary market.\n\nThe risk of loss in trading futures contracts\nor uncovered call options in some strategies\n(e.g., selling uncovered index futures\ncontracts) is potentially unlimited. The Fund\ndoes not plan to use futures and options\ncontracts, when available, in this manner. The\nrisk of a futures position may still be large\nas traditionally measured due to the low\nmargin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, may utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit its risk exposure to that\nwhich is comparable to what it would have\nincurred through direct investment in\nsecurities.\n\nUtilization of futures transactions by the\nFund involves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to its benchmark Index if\nthe index underlying the futures contracts\ndiffers from the benchmark Index or if the\nfutures contracts do not track the benchmark\nIndex as expected. There is also the risk of\nloss by the Fund of margin deposits in the\nevent of bankruptcy of a broker with whom the\nFund has an open position in the futures\ncontract or option.\n\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit establishes the maximum amount\nthat the price of a futures contract may vary\neither up or down from the previous day\u2019s\nsettlement price at the end of a trading\nsession. Once the daily limit has been reached\nin a particular type of contract, no trades\nmay be made on that day at a price beyond that\nlimit. The daily limit governs only price\nmovement during a particular trading day and\ntherefore does not limit potential losses,\nbecause the limit may prevent the liquidation\nof unfavorable positions. Futures contract\nprices have occasionally moved to the daily\nlimit for several consecutive trading days\nwith little or no trading, thereby preventing\nprompt liquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting some futures traders to substantial\nlosses.\n\nRISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nSwap agreements are subject to the risk that\nthe swap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, the\nFund will have contractual remedies pursuant\nto the agreements related to the transaction,\nbut such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy\nand insolvency laws which could affect the\nFund\u2019s rights as a creditor.\n\nThe use of interest-rate and index swaps is a\nhighly specialized activity that involves\ninvestment techniques and risks different from\nthose associated with ordinary portfolio\nsecurity transactions. The use of a swap\nrequires an understanding not only of the\nreferenced asset, reference rate or index but\nalso of the swap itself, without the benefit\nof observing the performance of the swap under\nall possible market conditions. These\ntransactions generally do not involve the\ndelivery of securities or other underlying\nassets or principal.\n\nThe absence of a regulated execution facility\nor contract market and lack of liquidity for\nswap transactions has led, in some instances,\nto difficulties in trading and valuation,\nespecially in the event of market disruptions.\nUnder recently adopted rules and regulations,\ntransactions in some types of swaps are\nrequired to be centrally cleared. In a cleared\nderivatives transaction, the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty to the transaction is a central\nderivatives clearing organization, or clearing\nhouse, rather than a bank or broker. Because\nthe Fund is not a member of a clearing house,\nand only members of a clearing house can\nparticipate directly in the clearing house,\nthe Fund holds cleared derivatives through\naccounts at clearing members. In cleared\nderivatives transactions, the Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and\nreceive payments from a clearing house through\nits accounts at clearing members. Clearing\nmembers guarantee performance of their\nclients\u2019 obligations to the clearing house.\nCentrally cleared derivative arrangements may\nbe less\n                      20                      \nfavorable to the Fund than bilateral (non-\ncleared) arrangements. For example, the Fund\nmay be required to provide greater amounts of\nmargin for cleared derivatives transactions\nthan for bilateral derivatives transactions.\nAlso, in contrast to bilateral derivatives\ntransactions, in some cases following a period\nof notice to the Fund, a clearing member\ngenerally can require termination of existing\ncleared derivatives transactions at any time\nor an increase in margin requirements above\nthe margin that the clearing member required\nat the beginning of a transaction. Clearing\nhouses also have broad rights to increase\nmargin requirements for existing transactions\nor to terminate transactions at any time. The\nFund is subject to risk if it enters into a\nderivatives transaction that is required to be\ncleared (or which SSGA FM expects to be\ncleared), and no clearing member is willing or\nable to clear the transaction on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf. In that case, the transaction might\nhave to be terminated, and the Fund could lose\nsome or all of the benefit of the transaction,\nincluding loss of an increase in the value of\nthe transaction and loss of hedging\nprotection. In addition, the documentation\ngoverning the relationship between the Fund\nand clearing members is drafted by the\nclearing members and generally is less\nfavorable to the Fund than typical bilateral\nderivatives documentation.\n\nThese clearing rules and other new rules and\nregulations could, among other things,\nrestrict the Fund\u2019s ability to engage in, or\nincrease the cost to the Fund of, derivatives\ntransactions, for example, by making some\ntypes of derivatives no longer available to\nthe Fund, increasing margin or capital\nrequirements, or otherwise limiting liquidity\nor increasing transaction costs. These\nregulations are new and evolving, so their\npotential impact on the Fund and the financial\nsystem are not yet known.\n\nBecause they are two party contracts that may\nbe subject to contractual restrictions on\ntransferability and termination and because\nthey may have terms of greater than seven\ndays, swap agreements may be considered to be\nilliquid and subject to the Fund\u2019s limitation\non investments in illiquid securities. To the\nextent that a swap is not liquid, it may not\nbe possible to initiate a transaction or\nliquidate a position at an advantageous time\nor price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Like most other investments, swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nmarket value of the instrument will change in\na way detrimental to the Fund\u2019s interest.\n\nIf the Fund uses a swap as a hedge against, or\nas a substitute for, a portfolio investment,\nthe Fund will be exposed to the risk that the\nswap will have or will develop imperfect or no\ncorrelation with the portfolio investment.\nThis could cause substantial losses for the\nFund. While hedging strategies involving swap\ninstruments can reduce the risk of loss, they\ncan also reduce the opportunity for gain or\neven result in losses by offsetting favorable\nprice movements in other Fund investments.\nMany swaps are complex and often valued\nsubjectively.\n\nEUROPE \u2013 RECENT EVENTS\n\nA number of countries in Europe, including\nGreece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal,\nhave experienced rising government debt\nlevels. The concern over these debt levels has\nled to volatility in the European financial\nmarkets, which has adversely affected the\nexchange rate of the euro and may continue to\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe.\nFor some countries, the ability to repay\nsovereign debt is in question, and default is\npossible, which could affect their ability to\nborrow in the future. Several countries have\nagreed to multi-year bailout loans from the\nEuropean Central Bank, the IMF, and other\ninstitutions. A default or debt restructuring\nby any European country can adversely impact\nholders of that country\u2019s debt and can affect\nexposures to other EU countries and their\nfinancial companies as well. These financial\ndifficulties may continue, worsen or spread\nwithin or outside Europe. Responses to the\nfinancial problems by European governments,\ncentral banks and others, including austerity\nmeasures and reforms, may not work, may result\nin social unrest and may limit future growth\nand economic recovery or have other unintended\nconsequences.\n\nUncertainties regarding the viability of the\nEU have impacted and may continue to impact\nmarkets in the United States and around the\nworld. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom\nformally withdrew from the EU (commonly\nreferred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and entered an\n11-month transition period during which the\nUnited Kingdom remained part of the EU single\nmarket and customs union, the laws of which\ngoverned the economic, trade, and security\nrelations between the United Kingdom and EU.\nThe transition period concluded on December\n31, 2020, and the United Kingdom left the EU\nsingle market and customs union under the\nterms of a new trade agreement. The agreement\ngoverns the new relationship between the\nUnited Kingdom and EU with respect to trading\ngoods and services, but critical aspects of\nthe relationship remain unresolved and subject\nto further negotiation and agreement. The full\nscope and nature of the consequences of the\nexit are not at this time known and are\nunlikely to be known for a significant period\nof time. It is also unknown whether the United\nKingdom\u2019s exit will increase the likelihood of\nother countries also departing the EU. Any\nadditional exits from the EU, or the\npossibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments.\n\nLIBOR RISK\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA), which\nregulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to\nphase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. On\nNovember 30, 2020, the administrator of LIBOR\nannounced its intention to delay the phase out\nof the majority of the USD LIBOR publications\nuntil June 30, 2023, with the remainder of\nLIBOR publications to still end on December\n31, 2021.\n                      21                      \nVarious financial industry groups have begun\nplanning for the phase out, however, there\nremains uncertainty regarding the future\nutilization of LIBOR and the nature of any\nreplacement rate. The replacement or\nabandonment of, or modification to, LIBOR\ncould have adverse impacts on newly issued\nfinancial instruments and existing financial\ninstruments which reference LIBOR. While some\ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate setting methodology, not\nall instruments may have such provisions and\nthere are significant uncertainty regarding\nthe effectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies. Abandonment of or modifications\nto LIBOR could lead to significant short-term\nand long-term uncertainty and market\ninstability and the extent to which that may\nimpact the Fund may vary depending on various\nfactors, which include, but are not limited\nto: (i) existing fallback or termination\nprovisions in individual contracts and (ii)\nwhether, how, and when industry participants\ndevelop and adopt new successor reference\nrates and/or fallbacks for both legacy and new\ninstruments. In addition, the transition to a\nsuccessor rate could potentially cause (i)\nincreased volatility or illiquidity in markets\nfor instruments that currently rely on LIBOR,\n(ii) a reduction in the value of certain\ninstruments held by the Fund, or (iii) reduced\neffectiveness of related Fund transactions,\nsuch as hedging. It remains uncertain how such\nchanges would be implemented and the effects\nsuch changes would have on the Fund, issuers\nof instruments in which the Fund invests and\nfinancial markets generally. Instruments in\nwhich the Fund invests may pay interest at\nfloating or adjusting rates based on LIBOR or\nmay be subject to interest caps or floors.\nThere remains uncertainty regarding the future\nutilization of LIBOR and the nature of any\nreplacement rate. The unavailability or\nreplacement of LIBOR may affect the value,\nliquidity or return on certain Fund\ninvestments and may result in costs incurred\nin connection with closing out positions and\nentering into new trades. Any pricing\nadjustments to the Fund\u2019s investments\nresulting from a substitute reference rate may\nalso adversely affect the Fund\u2019s performance\nand/or NAV. Such successor or substitute\nreference rate and any adjustments selected\nmay negatively impact the Fund\u2019s investments,\nperformance or financial condition, and may\nexpose the Fund to additional tax, accounting\nand regulatory risks, Additionally, if LIBOR\nceases to exist, the Fund may need to\nrenegotiate the credit agreements extending\nbeyond the LIBOR phase out date with the\nFund\u2019s obligors that utilize LIBOR as a factor\nin determining the interest rate and certain\nof the Fund\u2019s existing credit facilities to\nreplace LIBOR with the new standard that is\nestablished. Any pricing adjustments to the\nFund\u2019s investments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s performance and/or NAV. Such successor\nor substitute reference rate and any\nadjustments selected may negatively impact the\nFund\u2019s investments, performance or financial\ncondition, and may expose the Fund to\nadditional tax, accounting and regulatory\nrisks.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with\nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a\nsteering committee comprised of large U.S.\nfinancial institutions, intends to replace the\nUSD LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate(SOFR), a new index calculated by short-\nterm repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury\nsecurities. Abandonment of or modifications to\nLIBOR could have adverse impacts on newly\nissued financial instruments and existing\nfinancial instruments which reference LIBOR.\nWhile some instruments may contemplate a\nscenario where LIBOR is no longer available by\nproviding for an alternative rate setting\nmethodology, not all instruments may have such\nprovisions and there are significant\nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any\nsuch alternative methodologies.\n\nIn 2012, regulators in the United States and\nthe United Kingdom alleged that some of the\nmember banks surveyed by the British Bankers\nAssociation engaged in manipulative acts in\nconnection with the calculation of LIBOR.\nSeveral financial institutions have reached\nsettlements with the CFTC, the U.S. Department\nof Justice Fraud Section and the FCA in\nconnection with investigations by such\nauthorities into submissions made by such\nfinancial institutions to the bodies that set\nLIBOR and other interbank offered rates.\nAdditional investigations remain ongoing with\nrespect to other major banks. Despite\nincreased regulation and other corrective\nactions since that time, concerns have arisen\nregarding LIBOR\u2019s viability as a benchmark,\ndue to decreased confidence of the market in\nLIBOR and lead market participants looking for\nalternative, non-LIBOR based types of\nfinancing, such as fixed rate loans or bonds\nor floating rate loans based on non-LIBOR\nindices.\n\nMARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING FROM COVID-19\n\nAn outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by\na novel coronavirus first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has spread globally in a short\nperiod of time. In an organized attempt to\ncontain and mitigate the effects of the spread\nof the coronavirus known as COVID-19,\ngovernments and businesses world-wide have\ntaken aggressive measures, including closing\nborders, restricting international and\ndomestic travel, and the imposition of\nprolonged quarantines of large populations.\nCOVID-19 has resulted in the disruption of and\ndelays in the delivery of healthcare services\nand processes, the cancellation of organized\nevents and educational institutions, the\ndisruption of production and supply chains, a\ndecline in consumer demand for certain goods\nand services, and general concern and\nuncertainty, all of which have contributed to\nincreased volatility in global markets. The\neffects of COVID-19 will likely affect certain\nsectors and industries more dramatically than\nothers, which may adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investments in those sectors or\nindustries. COVID-19, and other epidemics and\npandemics that may arise in the future, could\nadversely affect the economies of many\nnations, the global economy, individual\ncompanies and capital markets in ways that\ncannot be foreseen at the present time. In\naddition, the impact of infectious diseases in\ndeveloping or emerging market countries may be\ngreater due to limited health care resources.\nPolitical, economic and social stresses caused\nby COVID-19 also may exacerbate other pre-\nexisting political, social and economic risks\nin certain countries. The duration of COVID-19\nand its effects cannot be determined at this\ntime, but the effects could be present for an\nextended period of time.\n                      22                      \nTAX RISKS\n\nAs with any investment, you should consider\nhow your investment in Shares of the Fund will\nbe taxed. The tax information in the\nProspectus and this SAI is provided as general\ninformation. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in Shares of the Fund.\n\nUnless your investment in Shares is made\nthrough a tax-exempt entity or tax-advantaged\nretirement account, such as an individual\nretirement account, you need to be aware of\nthe possible tax consequences when the Fund\nmakes distributions or you sell Shares.\n                      23                      \n                                              \n           INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS            \nThe Trust has adopted the following investment\nrestrictions as fundamental policies with\nrespect to the Fund. These restrictions cannot\nbe changed without the approval of the holders\nof a majority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. For purposes of the 1940 Act, a\nmajority of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund means the vote, at an annual or a\nspecial meeting of the security holders of the\nTrust, of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the\nvoting securities of the Fund present at such\nmeeting, if the holders of more than 50% of\nthe outstanding voting securities of the Fund\nare present or represented by proxy, or (2)\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund. Except with the\napproval of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities, the Fund may not:\n\n1. Concentrate its investments in securities\nof issuers in the same industry, except as may\nbe necessary to approximate the composition of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying Index;\n\n2. Make loans to another person except as\npermitted by the 1940 Act or other governing\nstatute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the\nSEC or other regulatory agency with authority\nover the Fund;\n\n3. Issue senior securities or borrow money\nexcept as permitted by the 1940 Act or other\ngoverning statute, by the Rules thereunder, or\nby the SEC or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund;\n\n4. Invest directly in real estate unless the\nreal estate is acquired as a result of\nownership of securities or other instruments.\nThis restriction shall not preclude the Fund\nfrom investing in companies that deal in real\nestate or in instruments that are backed or\nsecured by real estate;\n\n5. Act as an underwriter of another issuer\u2019s\nsecurities, except to the extent the Fund may\nbe deemed to be an underwriter within the\nmeaning of the Securities Act in connection\nwith the Fund\u2019s purchase and sale of portfolio\nsecurities; or\n\n6. Invest in commodities except as permitted\nby the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other\nregulatory agency with authority over the\nFund.\n\nIn addition to the investment restrictions\nadopted as fundamental policies as set forth\nabove, the Fund observes the following\nrestrictions, which may be changed by the\nBoard without a shareholder vote. The Fund\nwill not:\n\n1. Invest in the securities of a company for\nthe purpose of exercising management or\ncontrol, provided that the Trust may vote the\ninvestment securities owned by the Fund in\naccordance with its views;\n\n2. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its total assets in securities\nthat comprise the benchmark Index. Securities\nthat have economic characteristics\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index are included within this\n80% investment policy; and\n\n3. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of\nborrowings for investment purposes, in U.S.\ndollar-denominated debt securities. Prior to\nany change in the Fund\u2019s 80% investment\npolicy, the Fund will provide shareholders\nwith 60 days\u2019 written notice.\n\nThe Fund defines the foregoing terms in\naccordance with the definition of such terms\nper the Index. If a percentage limitation is\nadhered to at the time of investment or\ncontract, a later increase or decrease in\npercentage resulting from any change in value\nor total or net assets will not result in a\nviolation of such restriction, except that the\npercentage limitations with respect to the\nborrowing of money will be observed\ncontinuously. With respect to the limitation\non borrowing, in the event that a subsequent\nchange in net assets or other circumstances\ncause the Fund to exceed its limitation, the\nFund will take steps to bring the aggregate\namount of borrowing back within the\nlimitations within three days thereafter (not\nincluding Sundays and holidays).\n\nThe 1940 Act currently permits the Fund to\nloan up to 33 1/3% of its total assets. With\nrespect to borrowing, the 1940 Act presently\nallows the Fund to: (1) borrow from any bank\n(including pledging, mortgaging or\nhypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 \u2044%\nof its total assets, (2) borrow money for\ntemporary purposes in an amount not exceeding\n5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets at\nthe time of the loan, and (3) enter into\nreverse repurchase agreements. However, under\nnormal circumstances any borrowings by the\nFund will not exceed 10% of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets. The 1940 Act generally prohibits funds\nfrom issuing senior securities, although it\ndoes not treat certain transactions as senior\nsecurities, such as certain borrowings, short\nsales, reverse repurchase agreements, firm\ncommitment agreements and standby commitments,\nwith appropriate earmarking or segregation of\nassets to cover such obligation. With respect\nto investments in commodities, the 1940 Act\npresently permits the Fund to invest in\ncommodities in accordance with\n                                              \n     The SEC Staff considers concentration    \n  1  to involve more than 25% of a fund\u2019s     \n     assets to be invested in an industry or  \n     group of industries.                     \n                                              \n                      24                      \ninvestment policies contained in its\nprospectus and SAI. Any such investment shall\nalso comply with the CEA and the rules and\nregulations thereunder. The 1940 Act does not\ndirectly restrict an investment company\u2019s\nability to invest in real estate, but does\nrequire that every investment company have the\nfundamental investment policy governing such\ninvestments. The Fund will not purchase or\nsell real estate, except that the Fund may\ninvest in companies that deal in real estate\n(including real estate investment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d)) or in instruments that are backed\nor secured by real estate.\n                                              \n         EXCHANGE LISTING AND TRADING         \n                                              \nA discussion of exchange listing and trading\nmatters associated with an investment in the\nFund is contained in the Prospectus under\n\u201cPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION\u201d and\n\u201cADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION.\u201d\nThe discussion below supplements, and should\nbe read in conjunction with, such sections of\nthe Prospectus.\n\nThe Shares of the Fund are approved for\nlisting and trading on the Exchange, subject\nto notice of issuance. Shares trade on the\nExchange at prices that may differ to some\ndegree from their net asset value. There can\nbe no assurance that the requirements of the\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nShares of the Fund will continue to be met.\n\nThe Exchange may consider the suspension of\ntrading in, and may initiate delisting\nproceedings of, the Shares of the Fund under\nany of the following circumstances: (i) if the\nExchange becomes aware that the Fund is no\nlonger eligible to operate in reliance on Rule\n6c-11 under the 1940 Act; (ii) if the Fund no\nlonger complies with the applicable listing\nrequirements set forth in the Exchange\u2019s\nrules; (iii) if, following the initial twelve-\nmonth period after commencement of trading on\nthe Exchange of the Fund, there are fewer than\n50 beneficial holders of the Fund; or (iv) if\nsuch other event shall occur or condition\nexists which, in the opinion of the Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Exchange\ninadvisable. The Exchange will remove the\nShares from listing and trading upon\ntermination of the Fund.\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nShare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund or an investor\u2019s\nequity interest in the Fund.\n\nAs in the case of other publicly traded\nsecurities, brokers\u2019 commissions on\ntransactions will be based on negotiated\ncommission rates at customary levels.\n\nThe base and trading currencies of the Fund is\nthe U.S. dollar. The base currency is the\ncurrency in which the Fund\u2019s net asset value\nper Share is calculated and the trading\ncurrency is the currency in which Shares of\nthe Fund are listed and traded on the\nExchange.\n                                              \n           MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST            \n                                              \nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u201cMANAGEMENT.\u201d\n\nBoard Responsibilities. The management and\naffairs of the Trust and its series, including\nthe Fund described in this SAI, are overseen\nby the Trustees. The Board has approved\ncontracts, as described in this SAI, under\nwhich certain companies provide essential\nmanagement services to the Trust.\n\nLike most mutual funds, the day-to-day\nbusiness of the Trust, including the\nmanagement of risk, is performed by third\nparty service providers, such as the Adviser,\nSub-Adviser, Distributor, Administrator and\nSub-Administrator. The Trustees are\nresponsible for overseeing the Trust\u2019s service\nproviders and, thus, have oversight\nresponsibility with respect to risk management\nperformed by those service providers. Risk\nmanagement seeks to identify and address\nrisks, i.e., events or circumstances that\ncould have material adverse effects on the\nbusiness, operations, shareholder services,\ninvestment performance or reputation of the\nFund. The Fund and its service providers\nemploy a variety of processes, procedures and\ncontrols to identify various of those possible\nevents or circumstances, to lessen the\nprobability of their occurrence and/or to\nmitigate the effects of such events or\ncircumstances if they do occur. Each service\nprovider is responsible for one or more\ndiscrete aspects of the Trust\u2019s business and,\nconsequently, for managing the risks\nassociated with that business. The Board has\nemphasized to the Fund\u2019s service providers the\nimportance of maintaining vigorous risk\nmanagement.\n\nThe Trustees\u2019 role in risk oversight begins\nbefore the inception of the Fund, at which\ntime the Fund\u2019s Adviser and Sub-Adviser\npresent the Board with information concerning\nthe investment objectives, strategies and\nrisks of the Fund, as well as proposed\ninvestment limitations for the Fund.\nAdditionally, the Fund\u2019s Adviser and Sub-\nAdviser provide the Board with an overview of,\namong\n                      25                      \nother things, their investment philosophies,\nbrokerage practices and compliance\ninfrastructures. Thereafter, the Board\ncontinues its oversight function as various\npersonnel, including the Trust\u2019s Chief\nCompliance Officer, as well as personnel of\nthe Adviser and other service providers, such\nas the Fund\u2019s independent accountants, make\nperiodic reports to the Audit Committee or to\nthe Board with respect to various aspects of\nrisk management. The Board and the Audit\nCommittee oversee efforts by management and\nservice providers to manage risks to which the\nFund may be exposed.\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the\nnature, extent and quality of the services\nprovided to the Fund by the Adviser and Sub-\nAdviser and receives information about those\nservices at its regular meetings. In addition,\non an annual basis, in connection with its\nconsideration of whether to renew the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement and Sub-Advisory\nAgreement with the Adviser and Sub-Adviser,\nrespectively, the Board meets with the Adviser\nand Sub-Adviser to review such services. Among\nother things, the Board regularly considers\nthe Adviser\u2019s and Sub-Adviser\u2019s adherence to\nthe Fund\u2019s investment restrictions and\ncompliance with various Fund policies and\nprocedures and with applicable securities\nregulations. The Board also reviews\ninformation about the Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nThe Trust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer reports\nregularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance issues. At least annually, the\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer provides the\nBoard with a report reviewing the adequacy and\neffectiveness of the Trust\u2019s policies and\nprocedures and those of its service providers,\nincluding the Adviser. The report addresses\nthe operation of the policies and procedures\nof the Trust and each service provider since\nthe date of the last report; any material\nchanges to the policies and procedures since\nthe date of the last report; any\nrecommendations for material changes to the\npolicies and procedures; and any material\ncompliance matters since the date of the last\nreport.\n\nThe Board receives reports from the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers regarding operational risks\nand risks related to the valuation and\nliquidity of portfolio securities. Regular\nreports are made to the Board concerning\ninvestments for which market quotations are\nnot readily available. Annually, the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nreviews with the Audit Committee its audit of\nthe Fund\u2019s financial statements, focusing on\nmajor areas of risk encountered by the Fund\nand noting any significant deficiencies or\nmaterial weaknesses in the Fund\u2019s internal\ncontrols. Additionally, in connection with its\noversight function, the Board oversees Fund\nmanagement\u2019s implementation of disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, which are designed to\nensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports\nwith the SEC are recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the required\ntime periods. The Board also oversees the\nTrust\u2019s internal controls over financial\nreporting, which comprise policies and\nprocedures designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the\nTrust\u2019s financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Trust\u2019s financial\nstatements.\n\nFrom their review of these reports and\ndiscussions with the Adviser and Sub-Adviser,\nthe Chief Compliance Officer, the independent\nregistered public accounting firm and other\nservice providers, the Board and the Audit\nCommittee learn in detail about the material\nrisks of the Fund, thereby facilitating a\ndialogue about how management and service\nproviders identify and mitigate those risks.\n\nThe Board recognizes that not all risks that\nmay affect the Fund can be identified and/or\nquantified, that it may not be practical or\ncost-effective to eliminate or mitigate\ncertain risks, that it may be necessary to\nbear certain risks (such as investment-related\nrisks) to achieve the Fund\u2019s goals, and that\nthe processes, procedures and controls\nemployed to address certain risks may be\nlimited in their effectiveness. Moreover,\nreports received by the Trustees as to risk\nmanagement matters are typically summaries of\nthe relevant information. Most of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment management and business affairs are\ncarried out by or through the Fund\u2019s Adviser,\nSub-Adviser and other service providers, each\nof which has an independent interest in risk\nmanagement but whose policies and the methods\nby which one or more risk management functions\nare carried out may differ from the Fund\u2019s and\neach other\u2019s in the setting of priorities, the\nresources available or the effectiveness of\nrelevant controls. As a result of the\nforegoing and other factors, the Board\u2019s\nability to monitor and manage risk, as a\npractical matter, is subject to limitations.\n\nTrustees and Officers. There are seven members\nof the Board of Trustees, six of whom are not\ninterested persons of the Trust, as that term\nis defined in the 1940 Act (\u201cIndependent\nTrustees\u201d). Carl Verboncoeur, an Independent\nTrustee, serves as Chairman of the Board. The\nBoard has determined its leadership structure\nis appropriate given the specific\ncharacteristics and circumstances of the\nTrust. The Board made this determination in\nconsideration of, among other things, the fact\nthat the Independent Trustees constitute a\nsuper-majority (greater than 75%) of the\nBoard, the fact that the chairperson of each\nCommittee of the Board is an Independent\nTrustee, the amount of assets under management\nin the Trust, and the number of funds (and\nclasses of shares) overseen by the Board. The\nBoard also believes that its leadership\nstructure facilitates the orderly and\nefficient flow of information to the\nIndependent Trustees from fund management.\n\nThe Board of Trustees has two standing\ncommittees: the Audit Committee and Trustee\nCommittee. The Audit Committee and Trustee\nCommittee are each chaired by an Independent\nTrustee and composed of all of the Independent\nTrustees.\n                      26                      \nSet forth

Each Code of Ethics\npermits personnel, subject to that Code of\nEthics, to invest in securities for their\npersonal investment accounts, subject to\ncertain limitations, including securities that\nmay be purchased or held by the Fund.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Codes of\nEthics will be effective in preventing such\nactivities.

As\nsuch, the Board has delegated the\nresponsibility to vote such proxies to the\nSub-Adviser. Each of the Trust\u2019s and the Sub-\nAdviser\u2019s proxy voting policy is attached at\nthe end of this SAI. SSGA LTD\u2019s proxy voting\npolicy is substantially and materially the\nsame as the Adviser\u2019s proxy voting policy.\nInformation regarding how the Fund voted\nproxies relating to its portfolio securities\nduring the most recent twelve-month period\nended June 30 is available: (1) without charge\nby calling 1-866-787-2257; (2) on the Fund\u2019s\nwebsite at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs; and (3)\non the SEC\u2019s website at https://www.sec.gov.\n\nDISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS POLICY\n\nThe Trust has adopted a policy regarding the\ndisclosure of information about the Trust\u2019s\nportfolio holdings.

The Investment Advisory Agreement\nwith respect to the Fund is terminable without\npenalty, on 60 days\u2019 notice, by the Board or\nby a vote of the holders of a majority (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund\u2019s\noutstanding voting securities. The Investment\nAdvisory Agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays\u2019 notice by the Adviser and will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined in the 1940 Act).\n\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, the\nAdviser, subject to the oversight of the Board\nand in conformity with the stated investment\npolicies of the Fund, manages the investment\nof the Fund\u2019s assets.

The Adviser pays all\nexpenses of the Fund other than the management\nfee, brokerage, taxes, interest, fees and\nexpenses of the Independent Trustees\n(including any Trustee\u2019s counsel fees),\nacquired fund fees and expenses, litigation\nexpenses and other extraordinary expenses.\n\nA summary of the factors considered by the\nBoard of Trustees in connection with the\ninitial approval of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement for the Fund will be available in\nthe Fund\u2019s annual report or semi-annual\nreport, as applicable, after the Fund\ncommences operations.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not pay\nfees to the Adviser for the past three fiscal\nyears.\n\nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all\nor a portion of its fee. The Adviser has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its\nmanagement fee and/or reimburse expenses in an\namount equal to any acquired fund fees and\nexpenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds\nfor cash management purposes, if any) for the\nFund until October 31, 2021. This contractual\nfee waiver and/or reimbursement does not\nprovide for the recoupment by the Adviser of\nany fees the Adviser previously waived. The\nAdviser may continue the waiver and/or\nreimbursement from year to year, but there is\nno guarantee that the Adviser will do so and\nthe waiver and/or reimbursement may be\ncancelled or modified at any time after\nOctober 31, 2021. The waiver and/or\nreimbursement may not be terminated prior to\nOctober 31, 2021 except with the approval of\nthe Board.\n                      36                      \nPursuant to the Advisory Agreement between the\nFund and the Adviser, the Adviser is\nauthorized to engage one or more sub-advisers\nfor the performance of any of the services\ncontemplated to be rendered by the Adviser.\nThe Adviser has engaged the following sub-\nadviser.\n\nINVESTMENT SUB-ADVISER\n\nThe Adviser has retained SSGA LTD, as sub-\nadviser, to assist in the day to day\nmanagement of the Fund\u2019s investments, subject\nto supervision of the Adviser and oversight by\nthe Board.

The Fund had not\ncommenced operations as of the date of this\nSAI and therefore did not pay fees to the Sub-\nAdviser for the past three fiscal years.\n\nA summary of the factors considered by the\nBoard of Trustees in connection with the\ninitial approval of the Sub-Advisory Agreement\nfor the Fund will be available in the Fund\u2019s\nfirst shareholder report after the Fund\ncommences operations.\n\nPORTFOLIO MANAGERS\n\nThe professionals primarily responsible for\nthe day-to-day portfolio management of the\nFund are Orhan Imer, Abhishek Kumar and James\nKramer.

Those\nconflicts could include preferential treatment\nof one account over others in terms of: (a)\nthe portfolio manager\u2019s execution of different\ninvestment strategies for various accounts or\n(b) the allocation of resources or of\ninvestment opportunities.\n\nPortfolio managers may manage numerous\naccounts for multiple clients. These accounts\nmay include registered investment companies,\nother types of pooled accounts (e.g.,\ncollective investment funds), and separate\naccounts (i.e., accounts managed on behalf of\nindividuals or public or private\ninstitutions). Portfolio managers make\ninvestment decisions for each account based on\nthe investment objectives and policies and\nother relevant investment considerations\napplicable to that portfolio.\n\nA potential conflict of interest may arise as\na result of the portfolio managers\u2019\nresponsibility for multiple accounts with\nsimilar investment guidelines. Under these\ncircumstances, a potential investment may be\nsuitable for more than one of the portfolio\nmanagers\u2019 accounts, but the quantity of the\ninvestment available for purchase is less than\nthe aggregate amount the accounts would\nideally devote to the opportunity. Similar\nconflicts may arise when multiple accounts\nseek to dispose of the same investment. The\nportfolio managers\n                      37                      \nmay also manage accounts whose objectives and\npolicies differ from that of the Fund. These\ndifferences may be such that under certain\ncircumstances, trading activity appropriate\nfor one account managed by the portfolio\nmanager may have adverse consequences for\nanother account managed by the portfolio\nmanager. For example, an account may sell a\nsignificant position in a security, which\ncould cause the market price of that security\nto decrease, while the Fund maintained its\nposition in that security.\n\nA potential conflict may arise when the\nportfolio managers are responsible for\naccounts that have different advisory fees\u2014the\ndifference in fees could create an incentive\nfor the portfolio manager to favor one account\nover another, for example, in terms of access\nto investment opportunities. Another potential\nconflict may arise when the portfolio manager\nhas an investment in one or more accounts that\nparticipate in transactions with other\naccounts. His or her investment(s) may create\nan incentive for the portfolio manager to\nfavor one account over another. The Adviser\nhas adopted policies and procedures reasonably\ndesigned to address these potential material\nconflicts. For instance, portfolio managers\nare normally responsible for all accounts\nwithin a certain investment discipline, and do\nnot, absent special circumstances,\ndifferentiate among the various accounts when\nallocating resources. Additionally, the\nAdviser and its advisory affiliates have\nprocesses and procedures for allocating\ninvestment opportunities among portfolios that\nare designed to provide a fair and equitable\nallocation.\n\nSSGA\u2019s culture is complemented and reinforced\nby a total rewards strategy that is based on a\npay for performance philosophy which seeks to\noffer a competitive pay mix of base salary,\nbenefits, cash incentives and deferred\ncompensation.\n\nSalary is based on a number of factors,\nincluding external benchmarking data and\nmarket trends, State Street performance, SSGA\nperformance, and individual overall\nperformance. SSGA\u2019s Global Human Resources\ndepartment regularly participates in\ncompensation surveys in order to provide SSGA\nwith market-based compensation information\nthat helps support individual pay decisions.\n\nAdditionally, subject to State Street and SSGA\nbusiness results, State Street allocates an\nincentive pool to SSGA to reward its\nemployees. The size of the incentive pool for\nmost business units is based on the firm\u2019s\noverall profitability and other factors,\nincluding performance against risk-related\ngoals. For most SSGA investment teams, SSGA\nrecognizes and rewards performance by linking\nannual incentive decisions for investment\nteams to the firm\u2019s or business unit\u2019s\nprofitability and business unit investment\nperformance over a multi-year period.\n\nIncentive pool funding for most active\ninvestment teams is driven in part by the\npost-tax investment performance of fund(s)\nmanaged by the team versus the return levels\nof the benchmark index(es) of the fund(s) on a\none-, three- and, in some cases, five-year\nbasis. For most active investment teams, a\nmaterial portion of incentive compensation for\nsenior staff is deferred over a four-year\nperiod into the SSGA Long-Term Incentive\n(\u201cSSGA LTI\u201d) program. For these teams, The\nSSGA LTI program indexes the performance of\nthese deferred awards against the post-tax\ninvestment performance of fund(s) managed by\nthe team. This is intended to align our\ninvestment team\u2019s compensation with client\ninterests, both through annual incentive\ncompensation awards and through the long-term\nvalue of deferred awards in the SSGA LTI\nprogram.\n\nFor the passive equity investment team,\nincentive pool funding is driven in part by\nthe post-tax 1 and 3-year tracking error of\nthe funds managed by the team against the\nbenchmark indexes of the funds.\n\nThe discretionary allocation of the incentive\npool to the business units within SSGA is\ninfluenced by market-based compensation data,\nas well as the overall performance of each\nbusiness unit. Individual compensation\ndecisions are made by the employee\u2019s manager,\nin conjunction with the senior management of\nthe employee\u2019s business unit. These decisions\nare based on the overall performance of the\nemployee and, as mentioned above, on the\nperformance of the firm and business unit.\nDepending on the job level, a portion of the\nannual incentive may be awarded in deferred\ncompensation, which may include cash and/or\nDeferred Stock Awards (State Street stock),\nwhich typically vest over a four-year period.\nThis helps to retain staff and further aligns\nSSGA employees\u2019 interests with SSGA clients\u2019\nand shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.\n\nSSGA recognizes and rewards outstanding\nperformance by:\n                                              \n       Promoting employee ownership to        \n  \u2022    connect employees directly to the      \n       company\u2019s success.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Using rewards to reinforce mission,    \n       vision, values and business strategy.  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Seeking to recognize and preserve the  \n  \u2022    firm\u2019s unique culture and team         \n       orientation.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Providing all employees the            \n  \u2022    opportunity to share in the success    \n       of SSGA.                               \n                                              \n                      38                      \nTHE ADMINISTRATOR, SUB-ADMINISTRATOR,\nCUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT\n\nAdministrator.

Its principal\naddress is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. Investor information can\nbe obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257. The\nDistributor has entered into a distribution\nagreement (\u201cDistribution Agreement\u201d) with the\nTrust pursuant to which it distributes Shares\nof the Fund. The Distribution Agreement will\ncontinue for two years from its effective date\nand is renewable annually thereafter. Shares\nwill be continuously offered for sale by the\nTrust through the Distributor only in Creation\nUnits, as described in the Prospectus and\nbelow under \u201cPurchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units.\u201d Shares in less than Creation\nUnits are not distributed by the Distributor.\nThe Distributor will deliver the Prospectus to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nand confirmations of acceptance furnished by\nit. The Distributor is a broker-dealer\nregistered under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and a member of\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n(\u201cFINRA\u201d). The Distributor has no role in\ndetermining the investment policies of the\nTrust or which securities are to be purchased\nor sold by the Trust. An affiliate of the\nDistributor may assist Authorized Participants\n(as defined below) in assembling shares to\npurchase Creation Units or upon redemption,\nfor which it may receive commissions or other\nfees from such Authorized Participants. An\naffiliate of the Distributor also receives\ncompensation from State Street for providing\non-line creation and redemption functionality\nto Authorized Participants through its Fund\nConnect application.\n\nThe Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of\nthe Adviser or Distributor, may directly or\nindirectly make cash payments to certain\nbroker-dealers for participating in activities\nthat are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives and other professionals more\nknowledgeable about exchange traded products,\nincluding the SPDR funds, or for other\nactivities, such as participation in marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems.\n\nIn addition, as of the date of this SAI, the\nAdviser and/or Distributor had arrangements\nwhereby they may make payments, other than for\nthe educational programs and marketing\nactivities described above, to Pershing LLC\n(\u201cPershing\u201d), RBC Capital Markets, LLC\n(\u201cRBC\u201d), LPL Financial, LLC (\u201cLPL\u201d), and\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management, LLC. These\namounts, which may be significant,\n                      39                      \nare paid by the Adviser and/or Distributor\nfrom their own resources and not from Fund\nassets. Pursuant to these arrangements,\nPershing, RBC and LPL have agreed to offer\ncertain SPDR funds to their customers and not\nto charge certain of their customers any\ncommissions when those customers purchase or\nsell shares of certain SPDR funds. Payments to\na broker-dealer or intermediary may create\npotential conflicts of interest between the\nbroker dealer or intermediary and its clients.\n\nIn addition, the Adviser or Distributor, or an\naffiliate of the Adviser or Distributor, as\nwell as an index provider that is not\naffiliated with the Adviser or Distributor,\nmay also reimburse expenses or make payments\nfrom their own assets to other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat they believe may benefit the SPDR\nbusiness or facilitate investment in SPDR\nfunds.\n\nThe Distribution Agreement provides that it\nmay be terminated at any time, without the\npayment of any penalty, as to the Fund: (i) by\nvote of a majority of the Independent Trustees\nor (ii) by vote of a majority (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund, on at least 60 days\nwritten notice to the Distributor.

Such Soliciting\nDealers may also be Participating Parties (as\ndefined in the \u201cBook Entry Only System\u201d\nsection below) and/or DTC Participants (as\ndefined below).\n\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the\nTrust has agreed to indemnify the Distributor,\nand may indemnify Soliciting Dealers and\nAuthorized Participants (as described below)\nentering into agreements with the Distributor,\nfor certain liabilities, including certain\nliabilities arising under the federal\nsecurities laws, unless such loss or liability\nresults from willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its\nobligations and duties under the Distribution\nAgreement or other agreement, as applicable.\n\nINDEX PROVIDER AND OTHER PERSONS\n\nAn unaffiliated index provider may make\npayments from its own assets to other persons\nin consideration for services provided or\nother activities that may facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds.\n                                              \n            BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS            \n                                              \nPortfolio transactions are placed on behalf of\nthe Fund by the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser, as\napplicable. Purchases and sales of securities\non a securities exchange are affected through\nbrokers who charge a commission for their\nservices. Ordinarily commissions are not\ncharged on over the counter orders (e.g.,\nfixed income securities) because the Fund pays\na spread which is included in the cost of the\nsecurity and represents the difference between\nthe dealer\u2019s quoted price at which it is\nwilling to sell the security and the dealer\u2019s\nquoted price at which it is willing to buy the\nsecurity. When the Fund executes an over the\ncounter order with an electronic\ncommunications network or an alternative\ntrading system, a commission is charged by\nsuch electronic communications networks and\nalternative trading systems as they execute\nsuch orders on an agency basis. Securities may\nbe purchased from underwriters at prices that\ninclude underwriting fees.\n\nIn placing a portfolio transaction, the\nAdviser seeks to achieve best execution. The\nAdviser\u2019s duty to seek best execution requires\nthe Adviser to take reasonable steps to obtain\nfor the client as favorable an overall result\nas possible for Fund portfolio transactions\nunder the circumstances, taking into account\nvarious factors that are relevant to the\nparticular transaction.\n\nThe Adviser refers to and selects from the\nlist of approved trading counterparties\nmaintained by the Adviser\u2019s Credit Risk\nManagement team.

The Adviser does not\nnecessarily select a trading counterparty\nbased upon price and costs but may take other\nrelevant factors into account if it believes\nthat these are important in taking reasonable\nsteps to obtain the best possible result for\nthe Fund under the circumstances.\nConsequently, the Adviser may cause a client\nto pay a trading counterparty more than\nanother trading counterparty might have\ncharged for the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value and quality of the\nbrokerage services provided. The following\nmatters may influence the relative importance\nthat the Adviser places upon the relevant\nfactors:\n\n(i) The nature and characteristics of the\norder or transaction. For example, size of\norder, market impact of order, limits, or\nother instructions relating to the order;\n\n(ii) The characteristics of the financial\ninstrument(s) or other assets which are the\nsubject of that order. For example, whether\nthe order pertains to an equity, fixed income,\nderivative or convertible instrument;\n\n(iii) The characteristics of the execution\nvenues to which that order can be directed, if\nrelevant. For example, availability and\ncapabilities of electronic trading systems;\n\n(iv) Whether the transaction is a \u2018delivery\nversus payment\u2019 or \u2018over the counter\u2019\ntransaction. The creditworthiness of the\ntrading counterparty, the amount of existing\nexposure to a trading counterparty and trading\ncounterparty settlement capabilities may be\ngiven a higher relative importance in the case\nof \u2018over the counter\u2019 transactions; and/or\n\n(v) Any other circumstances the Adviser\nbelieves is relevant at the time.\n\nThe process by which trading counterparties\nare selected to effect transactions is\ndesigned to exclude consideration of the sales\nefforts conducted by broker-dealers in\nrelation to the Fund.\n                      41                      \nThe Adviser does not currently use the Fund\u2019s\nassets in connection with third party soft\ndollar arrangements. While the Adviser does\nnot currently use \u201csoft\u201d or commission dollars\npaid by the Fund for the purchase of third\nparty research, the Adviser reserves the right\nto do so in the future.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not pay\nbrokerage commissions during the past three\nfiscal years.\n\nSecurities of \u201cRegular Broker-Dealers.\u201d The\nTrustis required to identify any securities of\nits \u201cregular brokers and dealers\u201d (as such\nterm is defined in the 1940 Act) which it may\nhold at the close of its most recent fiscal\nyear. \u201cRegular brokers or dealers\u201d of the\nTrust are the ten brokers or dealers that,\nduring the most recent fiscal year: (i)\nreceived the greatest dollar amounts of\nbrokerage commissions from the Trust\u2019s\nportfolio transactions; (ii) engaged as\nprincipal in the largest dollar amounts of\nportfolio transactions of the Trust; or (iii)\nsold the largest dollar amounts of the Trust\u2019s\nshares.\n\nThe Trust\u2019s holdings in Securities of Regular\nBroker-Dealers as of June 30, 2020.\n                                              \n  J.P.

Shares\nof the Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee,\nCede & Co., and deposited with, or on behalf\nof, DTC. Except in the limited circumstance\nprovided below, certificates will not be\nissued for Shares.\n\nDTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was\ncreated to hold securities of its participants\n(the \u201cDTC Participants\u201d) and to facilitate the\nclearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions among the DTC Participants in\nsuch securities through electronic book-entry\nchanges in accounts of the DTC Participants,\nthereby eliminating the need for physical\nmovement of securities certificates. DTC\nParticipants include securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations,\nsome of whom (and/or their representatives)\nown DTC. More specifically, DTC is owned by a\nnumber of its DTC Participants and by the New\nYork Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and FINRA. Access\nto the DTC system is also available to others\nsuch as banks, brokers, dealers and trust\ncompanies that clear through or maintain a\ncustodial relationship with a DTC Participant,\neither directly or indirectly (the \u201cIndirect\nParticipants\u201d).\n\nBeneficial ownership of Shares is limited to\nDTC Participants, Indirect Participants and\npersons holding interests through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in Shares\n(owners of such beneficial interests are\nreferred to herein as \u201cBeneficial Owners\u201d) is\nshown on, and the transfer of ownership is\neffected only through, records maintained by\nDTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on\nthe records of DTC Participants (with respect\nto Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of Shares.\n\nConveyance of all notices, statements and\nother communications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be\n                      42                      \ncharged to the Trust a listing of the Shares\nof the Fund held by each DTC Participant. The\nTrust, either directly or through a third\nparty service, shall inquire of each such DTC\nParticipant as to the number of Beneficial\nOwners holding Shares, directly or indirectly,\nthrough such DTC Participant. The Trust,\neither directly or through a third party\nservice, shall provide each such DTC\nParticipant with copies of such notice,\nstatement or other communication, in such\nform, number and at such place as such DTC\nParticipant may reasonably request, in order\nthat such notice, statement or communication\nmay be transmitted by such DTC Participant,\ndirectly or indirectly, to such Beneficial\nOwners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to\neach such DTC Participant and/or third party\nservice a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to\nsuch transmittal, all subject to applicable\nstatutory and regulatory requirements.\n\nShare distributions shall be made to DTC or\nits nominee, Cede & Co., as the registered\nholder of all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon\nreceipt of any such distributions, shall\ncredit immediately DTC Participants\u2019 accounts\nwith payments in amounts proportionate to\ntheir respective beneficial interests in\nShares of the Fund as shown on the records of\nDTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC\nParticipants to Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners of Shares held through such\nDTC Participants will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is\nnow the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in bearer form or\nregistered in a \u201cstreet name,\u201d and will be the\nresponsibility of such DTC Participants.\n\nThe Trust has no responsibility or liability\nfor any aspects of the records relating to or\nnotices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made\non account of beneficial ownership interests\nin such Shares, or for maintaining,\nsupervising or reviewing any records relating\nto such beneficial ownership interests or for\nany other aspect of the relationship between\nDTC and the DTC Participants or the\nrelationship between such DTC Participants and\nthe Indirect Participants and Beneficial\nOwners owning through such DTC Participants.\n\nDTC may determine to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to Shares at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action\neither to find a replacement for DTC to\nperform its functions at a comparable cost or,\nif such a replacement is unavailable, to issue\nand deliver printed certificates representing\nownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes\nother arrangements with respect thereto\nsatisfactory to the Exchange.\n                                              \n   CONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF   \n   SECURITIES                                 \n                                              \nThe Fund had not commenced operations prior to\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any beneficial owners that owned greater\nthan 5% of the outstanding voting securities\nas of the date of this SAI.\n\nAn Authorized Participant (as defined below)\nmay hold of record more than 25% of the\noutstanding Shares. From time to time,\nAuthorized Participants may be a beneficial\nand/or legal owner of the Fund, may be\naffiliated with an index provider, may be\ndeemed to have control of the Fund and/or may\nbe able to affect the outcome of matters\npresented for a vote of the shareholders of\nthe Fund.

In such cases, the Agent\nshall mirror vote (or abstain from voting)\nsuch Shares in the same proportion as all\nother beneficial owners of the Fund.\n\nThe Trustees and Officers of the Trust, as a\ngroup, own less than 1% of the Trust\u2019s voting\nsecurities as of the date of this SAI.\n                                              \n     PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION      \n     UNITS                                    \n                                              \nThe Fund issues and redeems its Shares on a\ncontinuous basis, at net asset value, only in\na large specified number of Shares called a\n\u201cCreation Unit.\u201d The value of the Fund is\ndetermined once each business day, as\ndescribed under \u201cDetermination of Net Asset\nValue.\u201d The Creation Unit size for the Fund\nmay change. Authorized Participants (as\ndefined below) will be notified of such\nchange. The principal consideration for\ncreations and redemptions for the Fund is set\nforth in the table below:\n                                              \n  FUND              CREATION*    REDEMPTION*  \n  SPDR Bloomberg                              \n  Barclays                                    \n  Emerging          In-Kind      In-Kind      \n  Markets                                     \n  USD Bond ETF                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  May be revised at any time without       \n     notice.                                  \n                                              \nPURCHASE (CREATION). The Trust issues and\nsells Shares of the Fund only in Creation\nUnits on a continuous basis through the\nPrincipal Underwriter, without a sales load\n(but subject to transaction fees), at their\nNAV per share next determined after receipt of\nan order, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), in proper form pursuant to the terms\nof the Authorized Participant Agreement\n(\u201cParticipant Agreement\u201d). A \u201cBusiness Day\u201d\nwith respect to the Fund is, generally, any\nday on which the NYSE is open for business,\nwith the exception of Veterans Day and\nColumbus Day.\n                      43                      \nFUND DEPOSIT. The consideration for purchase\nof a Creation Unit of the Fund generally\nconsists of either (i) the Deposit Securities\nand the Cash Component (defined below),\ncomputed as described below or (ii) the cash\nvalue of the Deposit Securities and \u201cCash\nComponent,\u201d computed as described below. When\naccepting purchases of Creation Units for\ncash, the Fund may incur additional costs\nassociated with the acquisition of Deposit\nSecurities that would otherwise be provided by\nan in-kind purchaser.\n\nTogether, the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u201cFund Deposit,\u201d which\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of the\nFund. The \u201cCash Component\u201d which may include a\nDividend Equivalent Payment, is an amount\nequal to the difference between the net asset\nvalue of the Shares (per Creation Unit) and\nthe market value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable. The \u201cDividend\nEquivalent Payment\u201d enables the Fund to make a\ncomplete distribution of dividends on the day\npreceding the next dividend payment date, and\nis an amount equal, on a per Creation Unit\nbasis, to the dividends on all the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund (\u201cDividend Securities\u201d)\nwith ex-dividend dates within the accumulation\nperiod for such distribution (the\n\u201cAccumulation Period\u201d), net of expenses and\nliabilities for such period, as if all of the\nDividend Securities had been held by the Fund\nfor the entire Accumulation Period. The\nAccumulation Period begins on the ex-dividend\ndate for the Fund and ends on the day\npreceding the next ex-dividend date. If the\nCash Component is a positive number (i.e., the\nnet asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the\nmarket value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash\nComponent shall be such positive amount. If\nthe Cash Component is a negative number (i.e.,\nthe net asset value per Creation Unit is less\nthan the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),\nthe Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to\nreceive cash in an amount equal to the Cash\nComponent. The Cash Component serves the\nfunction of compensating for any differences\nbetween the net asset value per Creation Unit\nand the market value of the Deposit Securities\nor Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of\nthe Cash Component excludes any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities, if applicable, which shall\nbe the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below).\n\nThe Custodian, through NSCC, makes available\non each Business Day, prior to the opening of\nbusiness on the NYSE (currently 9:30 a.m.,\nEastern time), the list of the names and the\nrequired number of shares of each Deposit\nSecurity or the required amount of Deposit\nCash, as applicable, to be included in the\ncurrent standard Fund Deposit (based on\ninformation at the end of the previous\nBusiness Day) for the Fund. Such standard Fund\nDeposit is subject to any applicable\nadjustments as described below, in order to\neffect purchases of Creation Units of the Fund\nuntil such time as the next-announced\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities or the\nrequired amount of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, is made available.\n\nThe identity and number of shares of the\nDeposit Securities or the amount of Deposit\nCash, as applicable, required for a Fund\nDeposit for the Fund may be changed from time\nto time with a view to the investment\nobjective of the Fund. Information regarding a\nFund Deposit necessary for the purchase of a\nCreation Unit is made available to Authorized\nParticipants and other market participants\nseeking to transact in Creation Unit\naggregations.\n\nAs noted above, the Trust reserves the right\nto permit or require the substitution of\nDeposit Cash to replace any Deposit Security,\nwhich shall be added to the Cash Component,\nincluding, without limitation, in situations\nwhere the Deposit Security: (i) may not be\navailable in sufficient quantity for delivery,\n(ii) may not be eligible for transfer through\nthe systems of DTC for corporate securities\nand municipal securities or the Federal\nReserve System for U.S. Treasury securities;\n(iii) may not be eligible for trading by an\nAuthorized Participant (as defined below) or\nthe investor for which it is acting; (iv)\nwould be restricted under the securities laws\nor where the delivery of the Deposit Security\nto the Authorized Participant would result in\nthe disposition of the Deposit Security by the\nAuthorized Participant becoming restricted\nunder the securities laws, or (v) in certain\nother situations (collectively, \u201cnon-standard\norders\u201d). The Trust also reserves the right\nto: (i) permit or require the substitution of\nDeposit Securities in lieu of Deposit Cash;\nand (ii) include or remove Deposit Securities\nfrom the basket in anticipation of portfolio\nchanges. The adjustments described above will\nreflect changes, known to the Adviser on the\ndate of announcement to be in effect by the\ntime of delivery of the Fund Deposit, in the\ncomposition of the subject Index being tracked\nby the Fund or resulting from certain\ncorporate actions.\n\nPROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the Principal\nUnderwriter, as facilitated via the Transfer\nAgent, to purchase a Creation Unit of the\nFund, an entity must be (i) a \u201cParticipating\nParty\u201d, i.e., a broker-dealer or other\nparticipant in the clearing process through\nthe Continuous Net Settlement System of the\nNSCC (the \u201cClearing Process\u201d), a clearing\nagency that is registered with the SEC; or\n(ii) a DTC Participant (see \u201cBOOK ENTRY ONLY\nSYSTEM\u201d) and have the ability to clear through\nthe Federal Reserve System. In addition, each\nParticipating Party or DTC Participant (each,\nan \u201cAuthorized Participant\u201d) must execute a\nParticipant Agreement that has been agreed to\nby the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer\nAgent, and that has been accepted by the\nTrust, with respect to purchases and\nredemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized\nParticipant will agree, pursuant to the terms\nof a Participant Agreement, on behalf of\nitself or any investor on whose behalf it will\nact, to certain conditions, including that it\nwill pay to the Trust, an amount of cash\nsufficient to pay the Cash Component together\nwith the creation transaction fee (described\nbelow) and any other applicable fees, taxes\nand additional variable charge.\n                      44                      \nAll orders to purchase Shares directly from\nthe Fund, including non-standard orders, must\nbe placed for one or more Creation Units and\nin the manner and by the time set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement and/or the applicable\norder form. The date on which an order to\npurchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem\nCreation Units, as set forth below) is\nreceived and accepted is referred to as the\n\u201cOrder Placement Date.\u201d\n\nAn Authorized Participant may require an\ninvestor to make certain representations or\nenter into agreements with respect to the\norder (e.g., to provide for payments of cash,\nwhen required). Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not have executed\na Participant Agreement and that, therefore,\norders to purchase Shares directly from the\nFund in Creation Units have to be placed by\nthe investor\u2019s broker through an Authorized\nParticipant that has executed a Participant\nAgreement. In such cases there may be\nadditional charges to such investor. At any\ngiven time, there may be only a limited number\nof broker-dealers that have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and only a small number\nof such Authorized Participants may have\ninternational capabilities.\n\nOn days when the Exchange or the bond markets\nclose earlier than normal, the Fund may\nrequire orders to create Creation Units to be\nplaced earlier in the day. In addition, if a\nmarket or markets on which the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are primarily traded is closed,\nthe Fund will also generally not accept orders\non such day(s). Orders must be transmitted by\nan Authorized Participant by telephone or\nother transmission method acceptable to the\nDistributor pursuant to procedures set forth\nin the Participant Agreement and in accordance\nwith the applicable order form. Those placing\norders through an Authorized Participant\nshould allow sufficient time to permit proper\nsubmission of the purchase order by the cut-\noff time. Economic or market disruptions or\nchanges, or telephone or other communication\nfailure may impede the ability to reach the\nDistributor or an Authorized Participant.\n\nFund Deposits must be delivered by an\nAuthorized Participant through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government\nsecurities), or through DTC (for corporate\nsecurities and municipal securities), through\na subcustody agent (for foreign securities)\nand/or through such other arrangements allowed\nby the Trust or its agents. With respect to\nforeign Deposit Securities, the Custodian\nshall cause the subcustodian of the Fund to\nmaintain an account into which the Authorized\nParticipant shall deliver, on behalf of itself\nor the party on whose behalf it is acting,\nsuch Deposit Securities. Foreign Deposit\nSecurities must be delivered to an account\nmaintained at the applicable local\nsubcustodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must\nbe ordered by the Authorized Participant in a\ntimely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of\nthe requisite number of Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, to the account of\nthe Fund or its agents by no later than the\nSettlement Date. The \u201cSettlement Date\u201d for the\nFund is generally the second Business Day\n(\u201cT+2\u201d) after the Order Placement Date. All\nquestions as to the number of Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as\napplicable, and the validity, form and\neligibility (including time of receipt) for\nthe deposit of any tendered securities or\ncash, as applicable, will be determined by the\nTrust, whose determination shall be final and\nbinding. The amount of cash represented by the\nCash Component must be transferred directly to\nthe Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank\nwire transfer system in a timely manner so as\nto be received by the Custodian no later than\nthe Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and\nthe Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, are not received in a timely\nmanner by the Settlement Date, the creation\norder may be cancelled. Upon written notice to\nthe Distributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using a\nFund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect\nthe then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery\nof Creation Units so created generally will\noccur no later than the second Business Day\nfollowing the day on which the purchase order\nis deemed received by the Distributor.\n\nThe order shall be deemed to be received on\nthe Business Day on which the order is placed\nprovided that the order is placed in proper\nform prior to the applicable cut-off time and\nthe federal funds in the appropriate amount\nare deposited by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions),\nwith the Custodian on the Settlement Date. If\nthe order is not placed in proper form as\nrequired, or federal funds in the appropriate\namount are not received by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00\np.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, then the\norder may be deemed to be rejected and the\nAuthorized Participant shall be liable to the\nFund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom.\nA creation request is considered to be in\n\u201cproper form\u201d if all procedures set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, order form and this\nSAI are properly followed.\n\nISSUANCE OF A CREATION UNIT. Except as\nprovided herein, Creation Units will not be\nissued until the transfer of good title to the\nTrust of the Deposit Securities or payment of\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, and the payment\nof the Cash Component have been completed.\nWhen the subcustodian has confirmed to the\nCustodian that the required Deposit Securities\n(or the cash value thereof) have been\ndelivered to the account of the relevant\nsubcustodian or subcustodians, the Principal\nUnderwriter and the Adviser shall be notified\nof such delivery, and the Trust will issue and\ncause the delivery of the Creation Units.\n\nIn instances where the Trust accepts Deposit\nSecurities for the purchase of a Creation\nUnit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in\nadvance of receipt by the Trust of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nas described below. In these circumstances,\nthe initial deposit will have a value greater\nthan the net asset value of the Shares on the\ndate the order is placed in proper form since\nin addition to available Deposit Securities,\ncash must be deposited in an amount equal to\nthe sum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii)\nan\n                      45                      \nadditional amount of cash equal to a\npercentage of the market value as set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, of the undelivered\nDeposit Securities (the \u201cAdditional Cash\nDeposit\u201d), which shall be maintained in a\ngeneral non-interest bearing collateral\naccount. An additional amount of cash shall be\nrequired to be deposited with the Trust,\npending delivery of the missing Deposit\nSecurities to the extent necessary to maintain\nthe Additional Cash Deposit with the Trust in\nan amount at least equal to the applicable\npercentage, as set forth in the Participant\nAgreement, of the daily marked to market value\nof the missing Deposit Securities. The Trust\nmay use such Additional Cash Deposit to buy\nthe missing Deposit Securities at any time.\nAuthorized Participants will be liable to the\nTrust for all costs, expenses, dividends,\nincome and taxes associated with missing\nDeposit Securities, including the costs\nincurred by the Trust in connection with any\nsuch purchases. These costs will be deemed to\ninclude the amount by which the actual\npurchase price of the Deposit Securities\nexceeds the market value of such Deposit\nSecurities on the day the purchase order was\ndeemed received by the Principal Underwriter\nplus the brokerage and related transaction\ncosts associated with such purchases. The\nTrust will return any unused portion of the\nAdditional Cash Deposit once all of the\nmissing Deposit Securities have been properly\nreceived by the Custodian or purchased by the\nTrust and deposited into the Trust. In\naddition, a transaction fee as set forth below\nunder \u201cCreation Transaction Fees\u201d will be\ncharged in all cases and an additional\nvariable charge may also be applied. The\ndelivery of Creation Units so created\ngenerally will occur no later than the\nSettlement Date.\n\nACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF CREATION UNITS. The\nTrust reserves the absolute right to reject an\norder for Creation Units transmitted in\nrespect of the Fund at its discretion,\nincluding, without limitation, if (a) the\norder is not in proper form; (b) the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable,\ndelivered by the Authorized Participant are\nnot as disseminated through the facilities of\nthe NSCC for that date by the Custodian; (c)\nthe investor(s), upon obtaining the Shares\nordered, would own 80% or more of the\ncurrently outstanding Shares of the Fund; (d)\nacceptance of the Deposit Securities would\nhave certain adverse tax consequences to the\nFund; (e) the acceptance of the Fund Deposit\nwould, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful;\n(f) the acceptance of the Fund Deposit would\notherwise, in the discretion of the Trust or\nthe Adviser, have an adverse effect on the\nTrust or the rights of beneficial owners; (g)\nthe acceptance or receipt of the order for a\nCreation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel\nto the Trust, be unlawful; or (h) in the event\nthat circumstances outside the control of the\nTrust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent\nand/or the Adviser make it for all practical\npurposes not feasible to process orders for\nCreation Units. Examples of such circumstances\ninclude acts of God or public service or\nutility problems such as fires, floods,\nextreme weather conditions and power outages\nresulting in telephone, telecopy and computer\nfailures; market conditions or activities\ncausing trading halts; systems failures\ninvolving computer or other information\nsystems affecting the Trust, the Principal\nUnderwriter, the Custodian, the Transfer\nAgent, DTC, NSCC, Federal Reserve System, or\nany other participant in the creation process,\nand other extraordinary events. The Trust or\nits agents shall communicate to the Authorized\nParticipant its rejection of an order. The\nTrust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and\nthe Principal Underwriter are under no duty,\nhowever, to give notification of any defects\nor irregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall either of them incur any\nliability for the failure to give any such\nnotification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent,\nthe Custodian and the Principal Underwriter\nshall not be liable for the rejection of any\npurchase order for Creation Units.\n\nAll questions as to the number of shares of\neach security in the Deposit Securities and\nthe validity, form, eligibility and acceptance\nfor deposit of any securities to be delivered\nshall be determined by the Trust, and the\nTrust\u2019s determination shall be final and\nbinding. REDEMPTION. Shares may be redeemed\nonly in Creation Units at their net asset\nvalue next determined after receipt of a\nredemption request in proper form by the Fund\nthrough the Transfer Agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE\nFUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN\nAMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors\nmust accumulate enough Shares in the secondary\nmarket to constitute a Creation Unit in order\nto have such Shares redeemed by the Trust.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that there\nwill be sufficient liquidity in the public\ntrading market at any time to permit assembly\nof a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to\nincur brokerage and other costs in connection\nwith assembling a sufficient number of Shares\nto constitute a redeemable Creation Unit.\n\nWith respect to the Fund, the Custodian,\nthrough the NSCC, makes available prior to the\nopening of business on the NYSE (currently\n9:30 a.m. Eastern time) on each Business Day,\nthe list of the names and share quantities of\nsecurities designated by the Fund that will be\napplicable (subject to possible amendment or\ncorrection) to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day\n(\u201cRedemption Securities\u201d). Redemption\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit Securities. The identity\nand number of shares of the Redemption\nSecurities or the Cash Redemption Amount\n(defined below) may be changed from time to\ntime with a view to the investment objective\nof the Fund.\n\nRedemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are\npaid either in-kind or in cash, or a\ncombination thereof, as determined by the\nTrust. With respect to in-kind redemptions of\nthe Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit will consist of Redemption Securities\nplus cash in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the net asset value of the Shares\nbeing redeemed, as next determined after a\nreceipt of a request in proper form, and the\nvalue of the Redemption Securities (the \u201cCash\nRedemption Amount\u201d), less a fixed redemption\ntransaction fee and any applicable additional\nvariable charge as set forth below. In the\nevent that the Redemption Securities have a\nvalue greater than the net asset value of the\nShares, a compensating cash payment equal to\nthe differential is required to be made by or\nthrough an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, at the Trust\u2019s discretion, an\nAuthorized Participant may receive the\ncorresponding cash value of the securities in\nlieu of the in-kind securities value\nrepresenting one or more Redemption\nSecurities.\n                      46                      \nPROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS.\nAfter the Trust has deemed an order for\nredemption received, the Trust will initiate\nprocedures to transfer the requisite\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to the Authorized Participant by the\nSettlement Date. With respect to in-kind\nredemptions of the Fund, the calculation of\nthe value of the Redemption Securities and the\nCash Redemption Amount to be delivered upon\nredemption will be made by the Custodian\naccording to the procedures set forth under\n\u201cDetermination of Net Asset Value\u201d, computed\non the Business Day on which a redemption\norder is deemed received by the Trust.\nTherefore, if a redemption order in proper\nform is submitted to the Principal Underwriter\nby a DTC Participant by the specified time on\nthe Order Placement Date, and the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund are delivered to\nthe Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions) on\nthe Settlement Date, then the value of the\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to be delivered will be determined by\nthe Custodian on such Order Placement Date. If\nthe requisite number of Shares of the Fund are\nnot delivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions) on\nthe Settlement Date, the Fund will not release\nthe underlying securities for delivery unless\ncollateral is posted in such percentage amount\nof missing Shares as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement (marked to market\ndaily).\n\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of the\nFund, in connection with taking delivery of\nshares of Redemption Securities upon\nredemption of Creation Units, an Authorized\nParticipant must maintain appropriate custody\narrangements with a qualified broker-dealer,\nbank or other custody providers in each\njurisdiction in which any of the Redemption\nSecurities are customarily traded (or such\nother arrangements as allowed by the Trust or\nits agents), to which account such Redemption\nSecurities will be delivered. Deliveries of\nredemption proceeds generally will be made\nwithin two Business Days of the trade date.\nDue to the schedule of holidays in certain\ncountries, however, the delivery of in-kind\nredemption proceeds may take longer than two\nBusiness Days after the day on which the\nredemption request is received in proper form.\nIf the Authorized Participant has not made\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nthe Redemption Securities in the applicable\nforeign jurisdiction and it is not possible to\nmake other such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of the\nRedemption Securities in such jurisdiction,\nthe Trust may, in its discretion, exercise its\noption to redeem such Shares in cash, and the\nAuthorized Participant will be required to\nreceive its redemption proceeds in cash.\n\nIf it is not possible to make other such\narrangements, or if it is not possible to\neffect deliveries of the Redemption\nSecurities, the Trust may in its discretion\nexercise its option to redeem such Shares in\ncash, and the redeeming investor will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in\ncash. In addition, an investor may request a\nredemption in cash that the Fund may, in its\nsole discretion, permit. In either case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe NAV of its Shares based on the NAV of\nShares of the Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption transaction fee and\nadditional charge for requested cash\nredemptions specified above, to offset the\nTrust\u2019s brokerage and other transaction costs\nassociated with the disposition of Redemption\nSecurities). The Fund may also, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder,\nprovide such redeemer a portfolio of\nsecurities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Redemption Securities but\ndoes not differ in net asset value.\n\nAn Authorized Participant submitting a\nredemption request is deemed to represent to\nthe Trust that, as of the close of the\nBusiness Day on which the redemption request\nwas submitted, it (or its client) will own\n(within the meaning of Rule 200 of Regulation\nSHO) or has arranged to borrow for delivery to\nthe Trust on or prior to the Settlement Date\nof the redemption request, the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund to be redeemed as\na Creation Unit. In either case, the\nAuthorized Participant is deemed to\nacknowledge that: (i) it (or its client) has\nfull legal authority and legal right to tender\nfor redemption the requisite number of Shares\nof the Fund and to receive the entire proceeds\nof the redemption; and (ii) if such Shares\nsubmitted for redemption have been loaned or\npledged to another party or are the subject of\na repurchase agreement, securities lending\nagreement or any other arrangement affecting\nlegal or beneficial ownership of such Shares\nbeing tendered, there are no restrictions\nprecluding the tender and delivery of such\nShares (including borrowed shares, if any) for\nredemption, free and clear of liens, on the\nredemption Settlement Date. The Trust reserves\nthe right to verify these representations at\nits discretion, but will typically require\nverification with respect to a redemption\nrequest from the Fund in connection with\nhigher levels of redemption activity and/or\nshort interest in the Fund. If the Authorized\nParticipant, upon receipt of a verification\nrequest, does not provide sufficient\nverification of its representations as\ndetermined by the Trust, the redemption\nrequest will not be considered to have been\nreceived in proper form and may be rejected by\nthe Trust.\n\nRedemptions of Shares for Redemption\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable federal and state securities laws\nand the Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Trust could not lawfully\ndeliver specific Redemption Securities upon\nredemptions or could not do so without first\nregistering the Redemption Securities under\nsuch laws. An Authorized Participant or an\ninvestor for which it is acting subject to a\nlegal restriction with respect to a particular\nsecurity included in the Redemption Securities\napplicable to the redemption of Creation Units\nmay be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The\nAuthorized Participant may request the\nredeeming investor of the Shares to complete\nan order form or to enter into agreements with\nrespect to such matters as compensating cash\npayment. Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201cqualified institutional buyer,\u201d\n(\u201cQIB\u201d) as such term is defined under Rule\n144A of the Securities Act, will not be able\nto receive Redemption Securities that are\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may\nbe required by the Trust to provide a written\nconfirmation with respect to QIB status in\norder to receive Redemption Securities.\n                      47                      \nThe right of redemption may be suspended or\nthe date of payment postponed with respect to\nthe Fund (1) for any period during which the\nExchange is closed (other than customary\nweekend and holiday closings); (2) for any\nperiod during which trading on the Exchange is\nsuspended or restricted; (3) for any period\nduring which an emergency exists as a result\nof which disposal of the Shares of the Fund or\ndetermination of the NAV of the Shares is not\nreasonably practicable; or (4) in such other\ncircumstance as is permitted by the SEC.\n\nREQUIRED EARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as described in\nthe Participant Agreement and/or applicable\norder form, the Fund may require orders to be\nplaced prior to the trade date, as described\nin the Participant Agreement or the applicable\norder form, in order to receive the trade\ndate\u2019s net asset value. The cut-off time to\nreceive the trade date\u2019s net asset value will\nnot precede the calculation of the net asset\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s shares on the prior\nBusiness Day. Orders to purchase shares of\nsuch funds that are submitted on the Business\nDay immediately preceding a holiday or a day\n(other than a weekend) that the equity markets\nin the relevant foreign market are closed may\nnot be accepted. Authorized Participants may\nbe notified that the cut-off time for an order\nmay be earlier on a particular Business Day,\nas described in the Participant Agreement and\nthe applicable order form.\n\nCREATION AND REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES. A\ntransaction fee, as set forth in the table\nbelow, is imposed for the transfer and other\ntransaction costs associated with the purchase\nor redemption of Creation Units, as\napplicable. Authorized Participants will be\nrequired to pay a fixed creation transaction\nfee and/or a fixed redemption transaction fee,\nas applicable, on a given day regardless of\nthe number of Creation Units created or\nredeemed on that day. The Fund may adjust the\ntransaction fee from time to time. An\nadditional charge or a variable charge\n(discussed below) will be applied to certain\ncreation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standard orders and whole or\npartial cash purchases or redemptions.

Expenses\nand fees, including the management fees, are\naccrued daily and taken into account for\npurposes of determining net asset value. The\nnet asset value of the Fund is calculated by\nState Street and determined once daily as of\nthe close of the regular trading session on\nthe NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time)\non each day that such exchange is open. Fixed-\nincome assets are generally valued as of the\nannounced closing time for trading in fixed-\nincome instruments in a particular market or\nexchange. Creation/redemption order cut-off\ntimes may be earlier on any day that the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable exchange or market\non which the Fund\u2019s investments are traded)\nannounces an early closing time. Any assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S.\ndollars at market rates on the date of\nvaluation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London\ntime) as quoted by one or more sources.\n                      48                      \nIn calculating the Fund\u2019s net asset value per\nShare, the Fund\u2019s investments are generally\nvalued using market valuations. A market\nvaluation generally means a valuation (i)\nobtained from an exchange, a pricing service,\nor a major market maker (or dealer), (ii)\nbased on a price quotation or other equivalent\nindication of value supplied by an exchange, a\npricing service, or a major market maker (or\ndealer) or (iii) based on amortized cost. The\nFund relies on a third-party service provider\nfor assistance with the daily calculation of\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV. The third-party service\nprovider, in turn, relies on other parties for\ncertain pricing data and other inputs used in\nthe calculation of the Fund\u2019s NAV. Therefore,\nthe Fund is subject to certain operational\nrisks associated with reliance on its service\nprovider and that service provider\u2019s sources\nof pricing and other data. NAV calculation may\nbe adversely affected by operational risks\narising from factors such as errors or\nfailures in systems and technology. Such\nerrors or failures may result in inaccurately\ncalculated NAVs, delays in the calculation of\nNAVs and/or the inability to calculate NAV\nover extended time periods. The Fund may be\nunable to recover any losses associated with\nsuch failures. In the case of shares of other\nfunds that are not traded on an exchange, a\nmarket valuation means such fund\u2019s published\nnet asset value per share. The Adviser may use\nvarious pricing services, or discontinue the\nuse of any pricing service, as approved by the\nBoard from time to time. A price obtained from\na pricing service based on such pricing\nservice\u2019s valuation matrix may be considered a\nmarket valuation.\n\nIn the event that current market valuations\nare not readily available or are deemed\nunreliable, the Trust\u2019s procedures require the\nOversight Committee to determine a security\u2019s\nfair value if a market price is not readily\navailable. In determining such value the\nOversight Committee may consider, among other\nthings, (i) price comparisons among multiple\nsources, (ii) a review of corporate actions\nand news events, and (iii) a review of\nrelevant financial indicators (e.g., movement\nin interest rates, market indices, and prices\nfrom the Fund\u2019s Index Provider). In these\ncases, the Fund\u2019s net asset value may reflect\ncertain portfolio securities\u2019 fair values\nrather than their market prices. The fair\nvalue of a portfolio instrument is generally\nthe price which the Fund might reasonably\nexpect to receive upon its current sale in an\norderly market between market participants.\nAscertaining fair value requires a\ndetermination of the amount that an\narm\u2019s-length buyer, under the circumstances,\nwould currently pay for the portfolio\ninstrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that\nthe fair value determination for a security is\nmaterially different than the value that could\nbe realized upon the sale of the security. In\naddition, fair value pricing could result in a\ndifference between the prices used to\ncalculate the Fund\u2019s net asset value and the\nprices used by the Fund\u2019s benchmark Index.\nThis may result in a difference between the\nFund\u2019s performance and the performance of the\nFund\u2019s benchmark Index. With respect to\nsecurities that are primarily listed on\nforeign exchanges, the value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities may change on days when\nyou will not be able to purchase or sell your\nShares.\n                                              \n         DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS          \n                                              \nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u201cDISTRIBUTIONS.\u201d\n\nGENERAL POLICIES\n\nDividends from net investment income, if any,\nare generally declared and paid monthly by the\nFund, but may vary significantly from period\nto period. Distributions of net realized\nsecurities gains, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid once a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more frequent\nbasis for the Fund to improve index tracking\nor to comply with the distribution\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code, in\nall events in a manner consistent with the\nprovisions of the 1940 Act.\n\nDividends and other distributions on Shares\nare distributed, as described below, on a pro\nrata basis to Beneficial Owners of such\nShares. Dividend payments are made through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants to\nBeneficial Owners then of record with proceeds\nreceived from the Trust.\n\nManagement of the Trust reserves the right to\ndeclare special dividends if, in its\nreasonable discretion, such action is\nnecessary or advisable to preserve the Fund\u2019s\neligibility for treatment as a RIC under the\nInternal Revenue Code or to avoid imposition\nof income or excise taxes at the Fund level.\n\nDIVIDEND REINVESTMENT\n\nBroker dealers, at their own discretion, may\noffer a dividend reinvestment service under\nwhich Shares are purchased in the secondary\nmarket at current market prices. Investors\nshould consult their broker dealer for further\ninformation regarding any dividend\nreinvestment service offered by such broker\ndealer.\n                      49                      \n                                              \n                    TAXES                     \nThe following is a summary of certain federal\nincome tax considerations generally affecting\nthe Fund and its shareholders that supplements\nthe discussion in the Prospectus. No attempt\nis made to present a comprehensive explanation\nof the federal, state, local or foreign tax\ntreatment of the Fund or its shareholders, and\nthe discussion here and in the Prospectus is\nnot intended to be a substitute for careful\ntax planning.\n\nThe following general discussion of certain\nfederal income tax consequences is based on\nthe Internal Revenue Code and the regulations\nissued thereunder as in effect on the date of\nthis SAI. New legislation, as well as\nadministrative changes or court decisions, may\nsignificantly change the conclusions expressed\nherein, and may have a retroactive effect with\nrespect to the transactions contemplated\nherein.\n\nThe following information should be read in\nconjunction with the section in the Prospectus\nentitled \u201cADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION.\u201d\n\nTAXATION OF THE FUND. The Fund is treated as a\nseparate corporation for federal income tax\npurposes. The Fund therefore is considered to\nbe a separate entity in determining its\ntreatment under the rules for RICs described\nherein and in the Prospectus. Losses in one\nseries of the Trust do not offset gains in any\nother series of the Trust and the requirements\n(other than certain organizational\nrequirements) for qualifying for treatment as\na RIC are determined at the Fund level rather\nthan at the Trust level. The Fund has elected\nor will elect and intends to qualify each year\nto be treated as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. As\nsuch, the Fund should not be subject to\nfederal income tax on its net investment\nincome and capital gains, if any, to the\nextent that it timely distributes such income\nand capital gains to its shareholders. In\norder to qualify for treatment as a RIC, the\nFund must distribute annually to its\nshareholders at least the sum of 90% of its\ntaxable net investment income (generally\nincluding the excess of net short-term capital\ngains over net long-term capital losses) and\n90% of its net tax exempt interest income, if\nany (the \u201cDistribution Requirement\u201d) and also\nmust meet several additional requirements.\nAmong these requirements are the following:\n(i) at least 90% of the Fund\u2019s gross income\neach taxable year must be derived from\ndividends, interest, payments with respect to\ncertain securities loans, gains from the sale\nor other disposition of stock, securities or\nforeign currencies, or other income derived\nwith respect to its business of investing in\nsuch stock, securities or currencies, and net\nincome derived from interests in qualified\npublicly traded partnerships (the \u201cQualifying\nIncome Requirement\u201d); and (ii) at the end of\neach quarter of the Fund\u2019s taxable year, its\nassets must be diversified so that (a) at\nleast 50% of the market value of its total\nassets must be represented by cash and cash\nitems, U.S. government securities, securities\nof other RICs and other securities, with such\nother securities limited, in respect to any\none issuer, to an amount not greater in value\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets and to not more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of its\ntotal assets is invested in the securities\n(other than U.S. government securities or\nsecurities of other RICs) of any one issuer,\nthe securities (other than securities of other\nRICs) of two or more issuers that it controls\nand that are engaged in the same, similar, or\nrelated trades or businesses, or the\nsecurities of one or more qualified publicly\ntraded partnerships (the \u201cDiversification\nRequirement\u201d).\n\nIf the Fund fails to satisfy the Qualifying\nIncome Requirement or the Diversification\nRequirement in any taxable year, the Fund may\nbe eligible for relief provisions if the\nfailures are due to reasonable cause and not\nwillful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid\nwith respect to each failure to satisfy the\napplicable requirements. Additionally, relief\nis provided for certain de minimis failures of\nthe Diversification Requirement where the Fund\ncorrects the failure within a specified period\nof time. In order to be eligible for the\nrelief provisions with respect to a failure to\nmeet the Diversification Requirement, the Fund\nmay be required to dispose of certain assets.\nIf these relief provisions were not available\nto the Fund and it were to fail to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of\nits taxable income would be subject to tax at\nthe regular corporate rate without any\ndeduction for distributions to shareholders,\nand its distributions (including capital gains\ndistributions) generally would be taxable as\nordinary income dividends to its shareholders,\nsubject to the dividends-received deduction\nfor corporate shareholders and the lower tax\nrates on qualified dividend income received by\nnoncorporate shareholders. To requalify for\ntreatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable\nyear, the Fund would be required to satisfy\nthe RIC qualification requirements for that\nyear and to distribute any earnings and\nprofits from any year in which the Fund failed\nto qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If the\nFund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, it would\ngenerally be required to pay a Fund-level tax\non certain net built-in gains recognized with\nrespect to certain of its assets upon a\ndisposition of such assets within five years\nof qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year.\nThe Board reserves the right not to maintain\nthe qualification of the Fund for treatment as\na RIC if it determines such course of action\nto be beneficial to shareholders.\n\nAs discussed more fully below, the Fund\nintends to distribute substantially all of its\nnet investment income and its capital gains\nfor each taxable year.\n\nIf the Fund meets the Distribution Requirement\nbut retains some or all of its income or\ngains, it will be subject to federal income\ntax to the extent any such income or gains are\nnot distributed. The Fund may designate\ncertain amounts retained as undistributed net\ncapital gain in a notice to its shareholders,\nwho (i) will be required to include in income\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-\nterm\n                      50                      \ncapital gain, their proportionate shares of\nthe undistributed amount so designated, (ii)\nwill be entitled to credit their proportionate\nshares of the income tax paid by the Fund on\nthat undistributed amount against their\nfederal income tax liabilities and to claim\nrefunds to the extent such credits exceed\ntheir liabilities and (iii) will be entitled\nto increase their tax basis, for federal\nincome tax purposes, in their Shares by an\namount equal to the excess of the amount of\nundistributed net capital gain included in\ntheir respective income over their respective\nincome tax credits. If the Fund failed to\nsatisfy the Distribution Requirement for any\ntaxable year, it would be taxed as a regular\ncorporation, with consequences generally\nsimilar to those described in the preceding\nparagraph.\n\nThe Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on\ncertain undistributed income if it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders in each\ncalendar year an amount at least equal to 98%\nof its ordinary income for the calendar year\nplus 98.2% of its capital gain net income for\nthe twelve months ended October 31 of such\nyear, subject to an increase for any shortfall\nin the prior year\u2019s distribution. The Fund\nintends to declare and distribute dividends\nand distributions in the amounts and at the\ntimes necessary to avoid the application of\nthis 4% excise tax.\n\nThe Fund may elect to treat part or all of any\n\u201cqualified late year loss\u201d as if it had been\nincurred in the succeeding taxable year in\ndetermining the Fund\u2019s taxable income, net\ncapital gain, net short-term capital gain, and\nearnings and profits. The effect of this\nelection is to treat any such \u201cqualified late\nyear loss\u201d as if it had been incurred in the\nsucceeding taxable year in characterizing Fund\ndistributions for any calendar year. A\n\u201cqualified late year loss\u201d generally includes\nnet capital loss, net long-term capital loss,\nor net short-term capital loss incurred after\nOctober 31 of the current taxable year\n(commonly referred to as \u201cpost-October\nlosses\u201d) and certain other late-year losses.\n\nCapital losses in excess of capital gains\n(\u201cnet capital losses\u201d) are not permitted to be\ndeducted against a RIC\u2019s net investment\nincome. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, potentially subject to certain\nlimitations, the Fund may carry a net capital\nloss from any taxable year forward\nindefinitely to offset its capital gains, if\nany, in years following the year of the loss.\nTo the extent subsequent capital gains are\noffset by such losses, they will not result in\nU.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund\nand may not be distributed as capital gains to\nits shareholders. Generally, the Fund may not\ncarry forward any losses other than net\ncapital losses.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014DISTRIBUTIONS. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders substantially all of its\ninvestment company taxable income (computed\nwithout regard to the deduction for dividends\npaid), its net tax-exempt income, if any, and\nany net capital gain (net recognized long-term\ncapital gains in excess of net recognized\nshort-term capital losses, taking into account\nany capital loss carryforwards). The Fund will\nreport to shareholders annually the amounts of\ndividends paid from ordinary income and the\namount of distributions of net capital gain.\nSince the Fund primarily holds investments\nthat do not pay dividends, it is not expected\nthat a substantial portion (if any) of the\ndividends paid by the Fund will qualify for\neither the dividends-received deduction for\ncorporations or the favorable income tax rates\navailable to individuals on qualified dividend\nincome.\n\nDistributions from the Fund\u2019s net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be taxable to\nshareholders as ordinary income. Distributions\nfrom the Fund\u2019s net capital gain will be\ntaxable to shareholders at long-term capital\ngains rates, regardless of how long\nshareholders have held their Shares. Long-term\ncapital gains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at rates of up to\n20%.\n\nAlthough dividends generally will be treated\nas distributed when paid, any dividend\ndeclared by the Fund in October, November or\nDecember and payable to shareholders of record\nin such a month that is paid during the\nfollowing January will be treated for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes as received by\nshareholders on December 31 of the calendar\nyear in which it was declared.\n\nIf the Fund\u2019s distributions exceed its\nearnings and profits, all or a portion of the\ndistributions made in the taxable year may be\ntreated as a return of capital to\nshareholders. A return of capital distribution\ngenerally will not be taxable but will reduce\nthe shareholder\u2019s cost basis and result in a\nhigher capital gain or lower capital loss when\nthe Shares on which the distribution was\nreceived are sold. After a shareholder\u2019s basis\nin the Shares has been reduced to zero,\ndistributions in excess of earnings and\nprofits will be treated as gain from the sale\nof the shareholder\u2019s Shares.\n\nDistributions that are reinvested in\nadditional Shares through the means of a\ndividend reinvestment service, if offered by\nyour broker-dealer, will nevertheless be\ntaxable dividends to the same extent as if\nsuch dividends had been received in cash.\n\nA 3.8% Medicare contribution tax generally\napplies to all or a portion of the net\ninvestment income of a shareholder who is an\nindividual and not a nonresident alien for\nfederal income tax purposes and who has\nadjusted gross income (subject to certain\nadjustments) that exceeds a threshold amount\n($250,000 if married filing jointly or if\nconsidered a \u201csurviving spouse\u201d for federal\nincome tax purposes, $125,000 if married\nfiling separately, and $200,000 in other\ncases). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a\nportion of the undistributed net investment\nincome of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. For these purposes,\ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains\n(generally including capital gain\ndistributions and capital gains realized on\nthe sale of Shares) are generally taken into\naccount in computing a shareholder\u2019s net\ninvestment income.\n                      51                      \nDistributions of ordinary income and capital\ngains may also be subject to foreign, state\nand local taxes depending on a shareholder\u2019s\ncircumstances.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS \u2013 SALE OF SHARES. In\ngeneral, a sale of Shares results in capital\ngain or loss, and for individual shareholders,\nis taxable at a federal rate dependent upon\nthe length of time the Shares were held. A\nsale of Shares held for a period of one year\nor less at the time of such sale will, for tax\npurposes, generally result in short-term\ncapital gains or losses, and a sale of those\nheld for more than one year will generally\nresult in long-term capital gains or losses.\nLong-term capital gains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at rates of up to\n20%.\n\nGain or loss on the sale of Shares is measured\nby the difference between the amount received\nand the adjusted tax basis of the Shares.\nShareholders should keep records of\ninvestments made (including Shares acquired\nthrough reinvestment of dividends and\ndistributions) so they can compute the tax\nbasis of their Shares.\n\nA loss realized on a sale of Shares may be\ndisallowed if substantially identical Shares\nare acquired (whether through the reinvestment\nof dividends or otherwise) within a sixty-one\n(61) day period beginning thirty (30) days\nbefore and ending thirty (30) days after the\ndate that the Shares are disposed of. In such\na case, the basis of the Shares acquired must\nbe adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.\nAny loss upon the sale of Shares held for six\n(6) months or less will be treated as a long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of any amounts\ntreated as distributions to the shareholder of\nlong-term capital gain (including any amounts\ncredited to the shareholder as undistributed\ncapital gains).\n\nCOST BASIS REPORTING. The cost basis of Shares\nacquired by purchase will generally be based\non the amount paid for the Shares and then may\nbe subsequently adjusted for other applicable\ntransactions as required by the Internal\nRevenue Code. The difference between the\nselling price and the cost basis of Shares\ngenerally determines the amount of the capital\ngain or loss realized on the sale or exchange\nof Shares. Contact the broker through whom you\npurchased your Shares to obtain information\nwith respect to the available cost basis\nreporting methods and elections for your\naccount.\n\nTAXATION OF FUND INVESTMENTS. Dividends and\ninterest received by the Fund on foreign\nsecurities may give rise to withholding and\nother taxes imposed by foreign countries. Tax\nconventions between certain countries and the\nUnited States may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If the Fund meets certain requirements,\nwhich include a requirement that more than 50%\nof the value of the Fund\u2019s total assets at the\nclose of its taxable year consist of certain\nforeign stocks or securities (generally\nincluding foreign government securities), then\nthe Fund should be eligible to file an\nelection with the Internal Revenue Service\n(the \u201cIRS\u201d) that may enable its shareholders,\nin effect, to receive either the benefit of a\nforeign tax credit, or a tax deduction, with\nrespect to certain foreign and U.S.\npossessions income taxes paid by the Fund,\nsubject to certain limitations. Pursuant to\nthis election, the Fund would treat those\ntaxes as dividends paid to its shareholders.\nEach such shareholder would be required to\ninclude a proportionate share of those taxes\nin gross income as income received from a\nforeign source and must treat the amount so\nincluded as if the shareholder had paid the\nforeign tax directly. The shareholder may then\neither deduct the taxes deemed paid by him or\nher in computing his or her taxable income or,\nalternatively, use the foregoing information\nin calculating any foreign tax credit the\nshareholder may be entitled to use against\nsuch shareholder\u2019s federal income tax. If the\nFund makes this election, the Fund will report\nannually to its shareholders the respective\namounts per share of the Fund\u2019s income from\nsources within, and taxes paid to, foreign\ncountries and U.S. possessions. No deduction\nfor such taxes will be permitted to\nindividuals in computing their alternative\nminimum tax liability. If the Fund does not\nmake this election, the Fund may be entitled\nto claim a deduction for certain foreign taxes\nincurred by the Fund. In certain instances,\nthe Fund might not elect to apply otherwise\nallowable U.S. federal income tax deductions\nfor those foreign taxes, whether or not\ncredits or deductions for those foreign taxes\ncould be passed through to its shareholders\npursuant to the election described above. If\nthe Fund does not elect to apply these\ndeductions, taxable distributions you receive\nfrom the Fund may be larger than they would\nhave been if the Fund had taken deductions for\nsuch taxes. Under certain circumstances, if\nthe Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes\npaid in respect of a prior year, the value of\nShares could be affected or any foreign tax\ncredits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund\u2019s foreign\ntaxes for the current year could be reduced.\n\nCertain Fund investments may be subject to\ncomplex provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode (including provisions relating to hedging\ntransactions, straddles, integrated\ntransactions, foreign currency contracts,\nforward foreign currency contracts, and\nnotional principal contracts) that, among\nother things, may affect the character of\ngains and losses realized by the Fund (i.e.,\nmay affect whether gains or losses are\nordinary or capital), accelerate recognition\nof income to the Fund and defer losses. These\nrules could therefore affect the character,\namount and timing of distributions to\nshareholders. These provisions also may\nrequire the Fund to mark-to-market certain\ntypes of positions in its portfolio (i.e.,\ntreat them as if they were closed out) which\nmay cause the Fund to recognize income without\nreceiving cash with which to make\ndistributions to its shareholders in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the RIC distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. The Fund intends to monitor its\ntransactions, intends to make appropriate tax\nelections, and intends to make appropriate\nentries in its books and records in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and\npreserve the Fund\u2019s qualification for\ntreatment as a RIC.\n                      52                      \nThe Fund is required for federal income tax\npurposes to mark-to-market and recognize as\nincome for each taxable year its net\nunrealized gains and losses on certain futures\ncontracts as of the end of the year as well as\nthose actually realized during the year. Gain\nor loss from futures and options contracts on\nbroad-based indexes required to be marked to\nmarket will be 60% long-term and 40% short-\nterm capital gain or loss. Application of this\nrule may alter the timing and character of\ndistributions to shareholders. The Fund may be\nrequired to defer the recognition of losses on\nfutures contracts, options contracts and swaps\nto the extent of any unrecognized gains on\noffsetting positions held by the Fund. It is\nanticipated that certain net gain realized\nfrom the closing out of futures or options\ncontracts will be considered gain from the\nsale of securities and therefore will be\nqualifying income for purposes of the\nQualifying Income Requirement.\n\nInvestments by the Fund in zero coupon or\nother discount securities will result in\nincome to the Fund equal to a portion of the\nexcess face value of the securities over their\nissue price (the \u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or\n\u201cOID\u201d) each year that the securities are held,\neven though the Fund may receive no cash\ninterest payments or may receive cash interest\npayments that are less than the income\nrecognized for tax purposes. In other\ncircumstances, whether pursuant to the terms\nof a security or as a result of other factors\noutside the control of the Fund, the Fund may\nrecognize income without receiving a\ncommensurate amount of cash. Such income is\nincluded in determining the amount of income\nthat the Fund must distribute to maintain its\neligibility for treatment as a RIC and to\navoid the payment of federal income tax,\nincluding the nondeductible 4% excise tax\ndescribed above.\n\nAny market discount recognized on a market\ndiscount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue, or below adjusted issue price if issued\nwith original issue discount. Absent an\nelection by the Fund to include the market\ndiscount in income as it accrues, gain on the\nFund\u2019s disposition of such an obligation will\nbe treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued\nmarket discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the OID and/or\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by the Fund, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or\ndispose of securities to enable the Fund to\nmake distributions to its shareholders in\norder to qualify for treatment as a RIC and\neliminate taxes at the Fund level.\n\nSpecial rules apply if the Fund holds\ninflation-indexed bonds, such as Treasury\nInflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).\nGenerally, all stated interest on inflation-\nindexed bonds is taken into income by the Fund\nunder its regular method of accounting for\ninterest income. The amount of any positive\ninflation adjustment for a taxable year, which\nresults from an increase in the inflation-\nadjusted principal amount of the bond, is\ntreated as OID. The amount of the Fund\u2019s OID\nin a taxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund\u2019s taxable income for such\nyear without a corresponding receipt of cash,\nuntil the bond matures. As a result, the Fund\nmay need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for the\napplicable year. The amount of any negative\ninflation adjustments, which result from a\ndecrease in the inflation-adjusted principal\namount of the bond, first reduces the amount\nof interest (including stated interest, OID,\nand market discount, if any) otherwise\nincludable in the Fund\u2019s taxable income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year; any\nremaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain\ncircumstances, carried forward to reduce the\namount of interest income taken into account\nwith respect to the bond in future taxable\nyears.\n\nTAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS. Certain tax-exempt\nshareholders, including qualified pension\nplans, individual retirement accounts, salary\ndeferral arrangements, 401(k) plans, and other\ntax-exempt entities, generally are exempt from\nfederal income taxation except with respect to\ntheir unrelated business taxable income\n(\u201cUBTI\u201d). Under current law, the Fund\ngenerally serves to block UBTI from being\nrealized by its tax-exempt shareholders.\nHowever, notwithstanding the foregoing, tax-\nexempt shareholders could realize UBTI by\nvirtue of their investment in the Fund where,\nfor example, (i) the Fund invests in REITs\nthat hold residual interests in real estate\nmortgage investment conduits (\u201cREMICs\u201d) or\n(ii) Shares constitute debt-financed property\nin the hands of the tax-exempt shareholders\nwithin the meaning of section 514(b) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Charitable remainder\ntrusts are subject to special rules and should\nconsult their tax advisors. The IRS has issued\nguidance with respect to these issues and\nprospective shareholders, especially\ncharitable remainder trusts, are strongly\nencouraged to consult with their tax advisors\nregarding these issues.\n\nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions\nwill be subject to a 1.4% tax on net\ninvestment income. For these purposes, certain\ndividends and capital gain distributions, and\ncertain gains from the disposition of Shares\n(among other categories of income), are\ngenerally taken into account in computing a\nshareholder\u2019s net investment income.\n\nFOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends, other than\ncapital gains dividends, \u201cshort-term capital\ngain dividends\u201d and \u201cinterest-related\ndividends\u201d (described below), paid by the Fund\nto shareholders who are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities will be subject to a 30%\nUnited States withholding tax unless a reduced\nrate of withholding or a withholding exemption\nis provided under applicable treaty law to the\nextent derived from investment income and\nshort-term capital gain or unless such income\nis effectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness carried on through a permanent\nestablishment in the United States.\nNonresident shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors concerning the\napplicability of the United States withholding\ntax and the proper withholding form(s) to be\nsubmitted to the Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an appropriate IRS Form\nW-8 may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate.\n                      53                      \nDividends reported by the Fund as (i)\ninterest-related dividends, to the extent such\ndividends are derived from the Fund\u2019s\n\u201cqualified net interest income,\u201d or (ii)\nshort-term capital gain dividends, to the\nextent such dividends are derived from the\nFund\u2019s \u201cqualified short-term gain,\u201d are\ngenerally exempt from this 30% withholding\ntax. \u201cQualified net interest income\u201d is the\nFund\u2019s net income derived from U.S.-source\ninterest and original issue discount, subject\nto certain exceptions and limitations.\n\u201cQualified short-term gain\u201d generally means\nthe excess of the Fund\u2019s net short-term\ncapital gain for the taxable year over its net\nlong-term capital loss, if any. In the case of\nShares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as an interest-related\ndividend or as a short-term capital gain\ndividend. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact\ntheir intermediaries with respect to the\napplication of these rules to their accounts.\n\nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold\nShares comply with IRS requirements that will\ngenerally require them to report information\nregarding U.S. persons investing in, or\nholding accounts with, such entities, a 30%\nwithholding tax may apply to Fund\ndistributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the\nwithholding described in this paragraph under\nan applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the\nterms of such agreement.\n\nBACKUP WITHHOLDING. The Fund will be required\nin certain cases to withhold (as \u201cbackup\nwithholding\u201d) on amounts payable to any\nshareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the U.S.\n\nCREATION UNITS. An Authorized Participant who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units\ngenerally will recognize a gain or a loss. The\ngain or loss will be equal to the difference\nbetween the market value of the Creation Units\nat the time and the sum of the exchanger\u2019s\naggregate basis in the securities surrendered\nplus the amount of cash paid for such Creation\nUnits. A person who redeems Creation Units\nwill generally recognize a gain or loss equal\nto the difference between the exchanger\u2019s\nbasis in the Creation Units and the sum of the\naggregate market value of any securities\nreceived plus the amount of any cash received\nfor such Creation Units. The IRS, however, may\nassert that a loss realized upon an exchange\nof securities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing\n\u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the basis that there has\nbeen no significant change in economic\nposition.\n\nAny gain or loss realized upon a creation of\nCreation Units will be treated as capital gain\nor loss if the Authorized Participant holds\nthe securities exchanged therefor as capital\nassets, and otherwise will be ordinary income\nor loss. Similarly, any gain or loss realized\nupon a redemption of Creation Units will be\ntreated as capital gain or loss if the\nAuthorized Participant holds the Shares\ncomprising the Creation Units as capital\nassets, and otherwise will be ordinary income\nor loss. Any capital gain or loss realized\nupon the creation of Creation Units will\ngenerally be treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss if the securities exchanged for such\nCreation Units have been held for more than\none year, and otherwise will be short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon the redemption of Creation Units\nwill generally be treated as long-term capital\ngain or loss if the Shares comprising the\nCreation Units have been held for more than\none year, and otherwise, will generally be\nshort-term capital gain or loss. Any capital\nloss realized upon a redemption of Creation\nUnits held for six (6) months or less will be\ntreated as a long-term capital loss to the\nextent of any amounts treated as distributions\nto the applicable Authorized Participant of\nlong-term capital gains with respect to the\nCreation Units (including any amounts credited\nto the Authorized Participant as undistributed\ncapital gains).\n\nThe Fund has the right to reject an order for\nCreation Units if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Shares\nso ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding\nshares of the Fund and if, pursuant to section\n351 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund\nwould have a basis in any deposit securities\ndifferent from the market value of such\nsecurities on the date of deposit. The Fund\nalso has the right to require information\nnecessary to determine beneficial Share\nownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. If the Fund does issue Creation\nUnits to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding Shares, the purchaser (or a group\nof purchasers) may not recognize gain or loss\nupon the exchange of securities for Creation\nUnits.\n\nPersons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units\nshould consult their own tax advisors with\nrespect to the tax treatment of any creation\nor redemption transaction.\n\nCERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\nUnder promulgated Treasury regulations, if a\nshareholder recognizes a loss on disposition\nof the Fund\u2019s shares of $2 million or more for\nan individual shareholder or $10 million or\nmore for a\n                      54                      \ncorporate shareholder (or certain greater\namounts over a combination of years), the\nshareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A\nshareholder who fails to make the required\ndisclosure to the IRS may be subject to\nadverse tax consequences, including\nsignificant penalties. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer\u2019s treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisers\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances.\n\nThe foregoing discussion is a summary only and\nis not intended as a substitute for careful\ntax planning. Purchasers of Shares should\nconsult their own tax advisors as to the tax\nconsequences of investing in such Shares,\nincluding under state, local and other tax\nlaws. Finally, the foregoing discussion is\nbased on applicable provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code, regulations, judicial authority\nand administrative interpretations in effect\non the date hereof. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.\n                                              \n      CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES      \n                                              \nThe Fund issues Shares of beneficial interest,\npar value $.01 per Share. The Board may\ndesignate additional funds.\n\nEach Share issued by the Trust has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of the corresponding\nseries of the Trust. Shares have no\npreemptive, exchange, subscription or\nconversion rights and are freely transferable.\nEach Share is entitled to participate equally\nin dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to the Fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of the Fund on\nliquidation.\n\nEach Share has one vote with respect to\nmatters upon which a shareholder vote is\nrequired consistent with the requirements of\nthe 1940 Act and the rules promulgated\nthereunder. Shares of all series of the Trust\n(\u201cFunds\u201d) vote together as a single class\nexcept that if the matter being voted on\naffects only a particular fund it will be\nvoted on only by that fund and if a matter\naffects a particular fund differently from\nother Funds, that fund will vote separately on\nsuch matter. Under Massachusetts law, the\nTrust is not required to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust\nis not to hold an annual meeting of\nshareholders unless required to do so under\nthe 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights for the election of Trustees.\nUnder Massachusetts law, Trustees of the Trust\nmay be removed by vote of the shareholders.\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, shareholders of a\nbusiness trust may, under certain\ncircumstances, be held personally liable as\npartners for obligations of the Trust.\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an\nexpress disclaimer of shareholder liability\nfor acts or obligations of the Trust, requires\nthat Trust obligations include such\ndisclaimer, and provides for indemnification\nand reimbursement of expenses out of the\nTrust\u2019s property for any shareholder held\npersonally liable for the obligations of the\nTrust. Thus, the risk of a shareholder\nincurring financial loss on account of\nshareholder liability is limited to\ncircumstances in which the Trust itself would\nbe unable to meet its obligations. Given the\nabove limitations on shareholder personal\nliability, and the nature of the Fund\u2019s assets\nand operations, the risk to shareholders of\npersonal liability is believed to be remote.\n\nShareholder inquiries may be made by writing\nto the Trust, c/o the Distributor, State\nStreet Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC\nat One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts\n02210.\n                                              \n     COUNSEL AND INDEPENDENT REGISTERED       \n     PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                   \n                                              \nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 1111 Pennsylvania\nAvenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, serves as\ncounsel to the Trust.

The ability of the Trust\nto effect in-kind redemptions within two\nBusiness Days of receipt of a redemption\nrequest is subject to, among other things, the\ncondition that, within the time period from\nthe date of the request to the date of\ndelivery of the securities, there are no days\nthat are local market holidays on the relevant\nBusiness Days. For every occurrence of one or\nmore intervening holidays in the local market\nthat are not holidays observed in the United\nStates, the redemption settlement cycle may be\nextended by the number of such intervening\nlocal holidays. In addition to holidays, other\nunforeseeable closings in a foreign market due\nto emergencies may also prevent the Trust from\ndelivering securities within two Business\nDays.\n                      55                      \nThe securities delivery cycles currently\npracticable for transferring portfolio\nsecurities to redeeming investors, coupled\nwith local market holiday schedules, may\nrequire a delivery process longer than the\nstandard settlement period. In certain\ncircumstances during the calendar year, the\nsettlement period may be greater than seven\ncalendar days.\n                                              \n             FINANCIAL STATEMENTS             \n                                              \nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any financial information to report for\nthe Trust\u2019s June 30, 2020 fiscal year end.\n\nSPDRSERTRUSBSAI\n                      56                      \n                                              \n                  APPENDIX A                  \n                                              \n              SPDR\u00aeSeries Trust               \n                                              \n                                              \n           SPDR\u00aeIndex Shares Funds            \n                                              \n                                              \n              SSGA Active Trust               \n                                              \n   (each, a \u201cTrust,\u201d and, collectively, the   \n                  \u201cTrusts\u201d)                   \n                                              \n      PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES      \n                                              \nThe Boards of Trustees of the Trusts have\nadopted the following policy and procedures\nwith respect to voting proxies relating to\nportfolio securities held by the Trusts\u2019\ninvestment portfolios.\n                           \n  1.  Proxy Voting Policy  \n                           \nThe policy of each Trust is to delegate the\nresponsibility for voting proxies relating to\nportfolio securities held by the Trusts to\nSSGA Funds Management, Inc.

Fiduciary Duty  \n                      \nThe right to vote proxies with respect to\nportfolio securities held by each Trust is an\nasset of the Trusts. The Adviser acts as a\nfiduciary of the Trusts and must vote proxies\nin a manner consistent with the best interest\nof the Trusts and the Funds\u2019 shareholders.\n                               \n  3.

Such       \n  engagements                                 \n  may lead to further monitoring to ensure    \n  that the                                    \n  company improves its governance or          \n  sustainability                              \n  practices. In these cases, the engagement   \n  process                                     \n  represents the most meaningful opportunity  \n  for us                                      \n  to protect long-term shareholder value      \n  from                                        \n  excessive risk due to poor governance and   \n  sustainability practices.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n         Global Proxy Voting and Engagement   \n         Principles                           \n  B-2                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n                        Reactive Reactive     \n                        engagement is         \n                        initiated by the      \n                        issuers. We           \n                        routinely discuss     \n                        specific voting       \n                        issues and items      \n                        with the issuer       \n                        community. Reactive   \n                        engagement is an      \n                        opportunity to        \n                        address not only      \n                        voting items, but     \n                        also a wide range of  \n                        governance and        \n                        sustainability        \n                        issues.               \n                        We have established   \n                        an engagement         \n                        protocol that         \n                        further describes     \n                        our approach to       \n                        issuer engagement.    \n                        Measurement           \n                        Assessing the         \n                        effectiveness of our  \n                        issuer engagement     \n                        process is often      \n                        difficult. In order   \n                        to limit the          \n                        subjectivity of       \n                        effectiveness         \n                        measurement, we       \n                        actively seek issuer  \n                        feedback and monitor  \n                        the actions issuers   \n                        take post-engagement  \n                        in order to identify  \n                        tangible changes.     \n                        Thus, we are able to  \n                        establish indicators  \n                        to gauge how issuers  \n                        respond to our        \n                        concerns and to what  \n                        degree these          \n                        responses satisfy     \n                        our requests. It is   \n                        also important to     \n                        note that successful  \n                        engagement activity   \n                        can be measured over  \n                        differing time        \n                        periods depending     \n                        upon the relevant     \n                        facts and             \n                        circumstances.        \n                        Engagements can last  \n                        as briefly as a       \n                        single meeting or     \n                        span multiple years.  \n                        Depending upon the    \n                        issue and whether     \n                        the engagement        \n                        activity is           \n                        reactive, recurring,  \n                        or active,            \n                        engagement with       \n                        issuers can take the  \n                        form of written       \n                        communication,        \n                        conference calls, or  \n                        in-person meetings.   \n                        We believe active     \n                        engagement is best    \n                        conducted directly    \n                        with company          \n                        management or board   \n                        members.              \n                        Collaborative         \n                        engagement, where     \n                        multiple              \n                        shareholders          \n                        communicate with      \n                        company               \n                        representatives, can  \n                        serve as a potential  \n                        forum for issues      \n                        that are not          \n                        identified by us as   \n                        requiring active      \n                        engagement.

ASX      \n  Corporate                                   \n  Governance Principles requires listed       \n  companies to                                \n  have an audit committee of at least three   \n  members                                     \n  all of whom are non-executive directors     \n  and a                                       \n  majority of whom are independent            \n  directors.

In       \n  addition, we                                \n  monitor other factors that may influence    \n  the                                         \n  independence of a non-executive director,   \n  such as                                     \n  performance-related pay,                    \n  cross-directorships and                     \n  significant shareholdings. Moreover, we     \n  may vote                                    \n  against the election of a director whose    \n  biographical disclosures are insufficient   \n  to                                          \n  assess his or her role on the board and/or  \n  independence.                               \n  Further, we expect boards of STOXX Europe   \n  600                                         \n  listed companies to have at least one       \n  female board                                \n  member. If a company fails to meet this     \n  expectation, State Street Global Advisors   \n  may vote                                    \n  against the Chair of the board\u2019s            \n  nominating                                  \n  committee or the board leader in the        \n  absence of a                                \n  nominating committee, if necessary.         \n  Although we generally are in favour of the  \n  annual                                      \n  election of directors, we recognise that    \n  director                                    \n  terms vary considerably in different        \n  European                                    \n  markets. We may vote against article/bylaw  \n  changes                                     \n  that seek to extend director terms. In      \n  addition,                                   \n  we may vote against directors if their      \n  terms                                       \n  extend beyond four years in certain         \n  markets.                                    \n  We believe companies should have relevant   \n  board                                       \n  level committees for audit, remuneration    \n  and                                         \n  nomination oversight.

If a company fails to meet this     \n  expectation, State Street Global Advisors   \n  may vote                                    \n  against the chair of the board\u2019s            \n  nominating                                  \n  committee or the board leader in the        \n  absence of a                                \n  nominating committee, if necessary.         \n  Additionally,                               \n  if a company fails to meet this             \n  expectation for                             \n  four consecutive years, State Street        \n  Global                                      \n  Advisors may vote against all incumbent     \n  members of                                  \n  the nominating committee.                   \n  While we are generally supportive of        \n  having the                                  \n  roles of chair and CEO separated in the UK  \n  market,                                     \n  we assess the division of responsibilities  \n  between                                     \n  chair and CEO on a case-by-case basis,      \n  giving                                      \n  consideration to factors such as the        \n  company\u2019s                                   \n  specific circumstances, overall level of    \n  independence on the board and general       \n  corporate                                   \n  governance standards in the company.        \n  Similarly, we                               \n  monitor for circumstances in which a        \n  combined                                    \n  chair/CEO is appointed or a former CEO      \n  becomes                                     \n  chair.                                      \n  We may also consider factors such as board  \n  performance and directors who appear to be  \n  remiss                                      \n  in the performance of their oversight       \n  responsibilities when considering their     \n  suitability for reappointment (e.g. fraud,  \n  criminal wrongdoing and breach of           \n  fiduciary                                   \n  responsibilities).                          \n  We believe companies should have            \n  committees for                              \n  audit, remuneration and nomination          \n  oversight.

We expect companies to  \n  have                                        \n  remuneration committees to provide          \n  independent                                 \n  oversight over executive pay. We will vote  \n  against                                     \n  nominees who are executive members of       \n  audit or                                    \n  remuneration committees.                    \n  We consider whether board members have      \n  adequate                                    \n  skills to provide effective oversight of    \n  corporate                                   \n  strategy, operations and risks, including   \n  environmental and social issues. Boards     \n  should                                      \n  also have a regular evaluation process in   \n  place to                                    \n  assess the effectiveness of the board and   \n  the                                         \n  skills of board members to address issues   \n  such as                                     \n  emerging risks, changes to corporate        \n  strategy, and                               \n  diversification of operations and           \n  geographic                                  \n  footprint.

Hybrid securities may also be    \n  *  subject to contractually allowable       \n     write-downs of principal that could      \n     result in impairment. Together with the  \n     hybrid indicator, the long-term          \n     obligation rating assigned to a hybrid   \n     security is an expression of the         \n     relative credit risk associated with     \n     that security.                           \n                                              \nFitch Ratings Ltd.\u2019s (\u201cFitch\u201d) Corporate\nFinance Obligations \u2013 Long-Term Ratings:\n\nAAA: Highest Credit Quality. \u2018AAA\u2019 ratings\ndenote the lowest expectation of credit risk.\nThey are assigned only in cases of\nexceptionally strong capacity for payment of\nfinancial commitments.

Additionally, the\nTrust\u2019s investment adviser, SSGA FM, also\nserves as investment adviser to each series of\nSPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA Active Trust.\nNonetheless, the Trust takes the position that\nit is not under common control with other\ntrusts because the power residing in the\nrespective boards and officers arises as the\nresult of an official position with the\nrespective trusts.\n\nAdditionally, see the \u201cControl Persons and\nPrincipal Holders of Securities\u201d section of\nthe Statement of Additional Information for a\nlist of shareholders who own more than 5% of a\nspecific fund\u2019s outstanding shares and such\ninformation is incorporated by reference to\nthis Item.\n                      6                       \n                             \n  Item\u00a030.  Indemnification  \n                             \nPursuant to Section 5.3 of the Registrant\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust and\nunder Section 4.9 of the Registrant\u2019s By-Laws,\nthe Trust will indemnify any person who is, or\nhas been, a Trustee, officer, employee or\nagent of the Trust against all expenses\nreasonably incurred or paid by him/her in\nconnection with any claim, action, suit or\nproceeding in which he/she becomes involved as\na party or otherwise by virtue of his/her\nbeing or having been a Trustee, officer,\nemployee or agent and against amounts paid or\nincurred by him/her in the settlement thereof,\nif he/she acted in good faith and in a manner\nhe/she reasonably believed to be in or not\nopposed to the best interests of the Trust,\nand, with respect to any criminal action or\nproceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe\nhis/her conduct was unlawful. In addition,\nindemnification is permitted only if it is\ndetermined that the actions in question did\nnot render him/her liable by reason of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in\nthe performance of his/her duties or by reason\nof reckless disregard of his/her obligations\nand duties to the Registrant. The Registrant\nmay also advance money for litigation expenses\nprovided that Trustees, officers, employees\nand/or agents give their undertakings to repay\nthe Registrant unless their conduct is later\ndetermined to permit indemnification.\n\nPursuant to Section 5.2 of the Registrant\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust, no\nTrustee, officer, employee or agent of the\nRegistrant shall be liable for any action or\nfailure to act, except in the case of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or\nreckless disregard of duties to the\nRegistrant. Pursuant to paragraph 9 of the\nRegistrant\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement,\nthe Adviser shall not be liable for any action\nor failure to act, except in the case of\nwillful misfeasance, bad faith or gross\nnegligence or reckless disregard of duties to\nthe Registrant.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liability\narising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the\n\u201cAct\u201d) may be permitted to directors, officers\nand controlling persons of the Registrant\npursuant to the provisions of Rule 484 under\nthe Act, or otherwise, the Registrant has been\nadvised that in the opinion of the SEC such\nindemnification is against public policy as\nexpressed in the Act and is, therefore,\nunenforceable. In the event that a claim for\nindemnification against such liabilities\n(other than the payment by the Registrant of\nexpenses incurred or paid by a director,\nofficer or controlling person of the\nRegistrant in the successful defense of any\naction, suit or proceeding) is asserted by\nsuch director, officer or controlling person\nin connection with the securities being\nregistered, the Registrant will, unless in the\nopinion of its counsel the matter has been\nsettled by controlling precedent, submit to a\ncourt of appropriate jurisdiction the question\nwhether such indemnification by it is against\npublic policy as expressed in the Act and will\nbe governed by the final adjudication of such\nissue.\n\nThe Registrant hereby undertakes that it will\napply the indemnification provision of its By-\nLaws in a manner consistent with Release 11330\nof the SEC under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), so long as\nthe interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i)\nthereunder remains in effect.\n\nThe Registrant maintains insurance on behalf\nof any person who is or was a Trustee,\nofficer, employee or agent of the Registrant,\nor who is or was serving at the request of the\nRegistrant as a trustee, director, officer,\nemployee or agent of another trust or\ncorporation, against any liability asserted\nagainst him/her and incurred by him/her or\narising out of his/her position. However, in\nno event will the Registrant maintain\ninsurance to indemnify any such person for any\nact for which the Registrant itself is not\npermitted to indemnify him/her.\n                                              \n  Item\u00a031.
