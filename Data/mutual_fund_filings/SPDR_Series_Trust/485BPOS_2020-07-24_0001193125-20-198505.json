The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n              \n  Year  Year  \n  1        3  \n  $10    $32  \n              \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. The Fund had not commenced\noperations as of the date of this Prospectus\nand, as a result, does not yet have a\nportfolio turnover rate. The Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In seeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P 500 ESG Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling\nstrategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund\nmay purchase a subset of the securities in the\nIndex in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size\nof the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may invest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of securities in the Index\nor may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined\nby the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. The Fund\nis classified as \u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may become \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nsolely as a result of changes in the\ncomposition of the Index (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or more component\nsecurities). When the Fund is non-diversified,\nit may invest a relatively high percentage of\nits assets in a limited number of issuers.\n\n1\nTable of Contents                             \nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at\nleast 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not\nincluded in the Index, cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments, such\nas repurchase agreements and money market\nfunds (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser). In seeking to track the Index,\nthe Fund's assets will generally be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group\nof industries. Futures contracts (a type of\nderivative instrument) may be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows. The Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of\nsecurities meeting certain sustainability\ncriteria (criteria related to ESG factors),\nwhile maintaining similar overall industry\ngroup weights as the S&P 500 Index. Securities\neligible for inclusion in the Index comprise\nall constituents of the S&P 500 Index except\nfor companies that:\n                                              \n     Have involvement with                    \n     tobacco-related products and services,   \n  \u2022  based on certain levels of production,   \n     revenue or ownership, as determined by   \n     Sustainalytics;                          \n     Are involved in                          \n     controversial weapons, including         \n     cluster weapons, landmines, biological   \n     or chemical weapons, depleted uranium    \n  \u2022  weapons, white phosphorus weapons, or    \n     nuclear weapons, or hold certain         \n     ownership stakes in a company involved   \n     in these activities, as                  \n     determined by Sustainalytics;            \n     Have a United Nations Global             \n  \u2022  Compact (\u201cUNGC\u201d) score in the bottom 5%  \n     of all UNGC-scored companies globally,   \n     as determined by Arabesque;              \n     Have an S&P DJI ESG                      \n     Score, as assigned by SAM, that falls    \n     within the worst 25% from each Global    \n  \u2022  Industry Classification Standard (GICS)  \n     industry group among the combined        \n     constituents of the S&P Global           \n     LargeMidCap Index and the S&P Global     \n     1200 Index; or                           \n     Do not                                   \n     have (i) Sustainalytics coverage for     \n  \u2022  tobacco- and controversial               \n     weapons-related involvement; (ii) a      \n     UNGC score determined by Arabesque; or   \n     (iii) an S&P DJI ESG Score.              \n                                              \nUNGC scores provided by Arabesque implement\nquantitative models and data to arrive at a\ncompany score based on the normative\nprinciples of the UNGC: human rights, labor\nrights, the environment, and anti-corruption.\nS&P DJI ESG Scores are assigned by SAM, an ESG\nscoring business unit of S&P Global Inc. (an\naffiliate of the Index Provider (defined\nbelow)), using its Corporate Sustainability\nAssessment, which is an annual evaluation of a\ncompany, based on ESG factors that SAM\ndetermines are financially material to the\ncompany, relative to its industry peer\ncompanies as determined by SAM. After\nimplementing the exclusion criteria described\nabove, the remaining companies are then ranked\nbased on their S&P DJI ESG Score. For each\nGICS industry group, companies are selected\nfor inclusion in the Index primarily in\ndecreasing order of S&P DJI ESG Score until\napproximately 75% of the float adjusted market\ncapitalization of the industry group is\nreached. The Index is float-adjusted market\ncapitalization weighted. The Index is\nreconstituted and rebalanced annually on the\nlast business day in April. In addition,\nbetween Index rebalances, Index constituents\nmay be removed from the Index for their\ninvolvement in economic crime and corruption,\nfraud, illegal commercial practices, human\nrights abuses, labor disputes, workplace\nsafety catastrophic accidents, environmental\ndisasters, and certain other activities\nassociated with environmental, social and\ngovernance risks. Any companies removed from\nthe Index on account of such activities are\nnot eligible for inclusion in the Index until\none full calendar year from the next\nrebalancing of the Index. As of June 30, 2020,\na significant portion of the Index comprised\ncompanies in the technology sector, although\nthis may change from time to time. As of June\n30, 2020, the Index comprised 310 stocks. The\nIndex is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the\nFund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund\nShares will change in value, and you could\nlose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely\n\n2\nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \naffect global economies and markets. Local,   \nregional or                                   \nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism, \nthe spread of infectious illness or other     \npublic health issues, or other events could   \nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \nEquity Investing Risk: The market prices of   \nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up \nor down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.  \nThe value of a security may decline for a     \nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to \nthe issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not    \nspecifically related to a particular company. \nIn addition, equity markets tend to move in   \ncycles, which may cause stock prices to fall  \nover short or extended periods of time.       \n                                              \nESG Investing Risk: The Index's incorporation \nof ESG considerations in its methodology may  \ncause the Fund to make different investments  \nthan funds that do not incorporate such       \nconsiderations in their strategy or investment\nprocesses. Under certain economic conditions, \nthis could cause the Fund's investment        \nperformance to be worse than funds that do not\nincorporate such considerations. The Index's  \nincorporation of ESG considerations may affect\nthe Fund's exposure to certain sectors and/or \ntypes of investments, and may adversely impact\nthe Fund's performance depending on whether   \nsuch sectors or investments are in or out of  \nfavor in the market.                          \n                                              \nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share         \nPremiums and Discounts Risk: As with all      \nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be     \nbought and sold in the secondary market at    \nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund     \nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of   \nthe shares is more than the net asset value   \nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is      \nheightened in times of market volatility or   \nperiods of steep market declines.             \n                                              \nCounterparty Risk: The Fund will be subject to\ncredit risk with respect to the counterparties\nwith which the Fund enters into derivatives   \ncontracts, repurchase agreements, reverse     \nrepurchase agreements, and other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails to meet its           \ncontractual obligations, the Fund may be      \nunable to terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, or to recover      \ncollateral posted to the counterparty,        \nresulting in a loss to the Fund. If the Fund  \nholds collateral posted by its counterparty,  \nit may be delayed or prevented from realizing \non the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding relating to the      \ncounterparty.                                 \n                                              \nDerivatives Risk: Derivative transactions can \ncreate investment leverage and may have       \nsignificant volatility. It is possible that a \nderivative transaction will result in a much  \ngreater loss than the principal amount        \ninvested, and the Fund may not be able to     \nclose out a derivative transaction at a       \nfavorable time or price. The counterparty to a\nderivatives contract may be unable or         \nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, \nreturn the Fund's margin, or otherwise honor  \nits obligations. A derivatives transaction may\nnot behave in the manner anticipated by the   \nAdviser or may not have the effect on the Fund\nanticipated by the Adviser.                   \n                                              \nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The    \nFund is managed with an indexing investment   \nstrategy, attempting to track the performance \nof an unmanaged index of securities,          \nregardless of the current or projected        \nperformance of the Index or of the actual     \nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs \nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a   \nresult, the Fund's performance may be less    \nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed    \nusing an active investment strategy. The      \nstructure and composition of the Index will   \naffect the performance, volatility, and risk  \nof the Index and, consequently, the           \nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nWhen there are changes made to the component  \nsecurities of the Index and the Fund in turn  \nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any   \ntransaction costs and market exposure arising \nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne     \ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of       \nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities  \nholdings to reflect changes in the securities \nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be   \nrequired to distribute any such gains to its  \nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income  \ntax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to  \ntrack the performance of the Index ( i.e. ,   \nachieve a high degree of correlation with the \nIndex), the Fund's return may not match the   \nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number \nof operating expenses not applicable to the   \nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling \nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be  \nfully invested at times, generally as a result\nof cash flows into or out of the Fund or      \nreserves of cash held by the Fund to meet     \nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to       \nreplicate the Index return by investing in    \nfewer than all of the securities in the Index,\nor in some securities not included in the     \nIndex, potentially increasing the risk of     \ndivergence between the Fund's return and that \nof the Index.                                 \n                                              \nLarge-Capitalization Securities Risk: Returns \non investments in securities of large         \ncompanies could trail the returns on          \ninvestments in securities of smaller and mid- \nsized companies. Larger companies may be      \nunable to respond as quickly as smaller and   \nmid-sized companies to competitive challenges \nor to changes in business, product, financial,\nor other market conditions. Larger companies  \nmay not be able to maintain growth at the high\nrates that may be achieved by well-managed    \nsmaller and mid-sized companies.              \n                      3                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market or     \nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability  \nof the Fund to sell a security at an          \nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\nsecurities may trade at a discount from       \ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value. \nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may limit  \nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet\nredemptions on a timely basis. In addition,   \nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in\nany illiquid securities and/or the difficulty \nin purchasing and selling such investments,   \nmay be unable to achieve its desired level of \nexposure to a certain market or sector.       \n                                              \nNew Fund Risk: The Fund is new and there is no\nassurance that the Fund will grow quickly.    \nWhen the Fund's size is small, the Fund may   \nexperience low trading volume, which could    \nlead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition,   \nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted  \nif the Fund does not meet certain conditions  \nof the listing exchange. Any resulting        \nliquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund  \nto incur elevated transaction costs for the   \nFund and negative tax consequences for its    \nshareholders.                                 \n                                              \nNon-Diversification Risk: To the extent the   \nFund becomes \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d the Fund may  \nhold a smaller number of portfolio securities \nthan many other funds. To the extent the Fund \ninvests in a relatively small number of       \nissuers, a decline in the market value of a   \nparticular security held by the Fund may      \naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund   \nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome non-diversified for periods of time    \nsolely as a result of changes in the          \ncomposition of the Index (e.g., changes in    \nweightings of one or more component           \nsecurities).                                  \n                                              \nTechnology Sector Risk: Market or economic    \nfactors impacting technology companies and    \ncompanies that rely heavily on technological  \nadvances could have a major effect on the     \nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of \nstocks of technology companies and companies  \nthat rely heavily on technology is            \nparticularly vulnerable to rapid changes in   \ntechnology product cycles, rapid product      \nobsolescence, government regulation and       \ncompetition, both domestically and            \ninternationally, including competition from   \nforeign competitors with lower production     \ncosts. Stocks of technology companies and     \ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,    \nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned    \ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the  \noverall market. Technology companies are      \nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual  \nproperty rights, the loss or impairment of    \nwhich may adversely affect profitability.     \nAdditionally, companies in the technology     \nsector may face dramatic and often            \nunpredictable changes in growth rates and     \ncompetition for the services of qualified     \npersonnel.                                    \n                                              \nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest\na substantial portion of its assets within one\nor more economic sectors or industries, which \nmay change from time to time. Greater         \ninvestment focus on one or more sectors or    \nindustries increases the potential for        \nvolatility and the risk that events negatively\naffecting such sectors or industries could    \nreduce returns, potentially causing the value \nof the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps     \nsignificantly.                                \n                                              \n  Fund Performance                            \n                                              \nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of   \nthe date of this Prospectus. Once             \nthe Fund has completed a full calendar year of\noperations, a bar chart and table will be     \nincluded that will provide some indication of \nthe risks of investing in the Fund by showing \nthe variability of the Fund's returns based on\nnet assets and                                \ncomparing the Fund's performance to the Index.\nWhen available,\u00a0updated performance           \ninformation\u00a0may be obtained\u00a0by calling        \n1-866-787-2257 or visiting\u00a0the Fund's\u00a0website:\nhttps://www.spdrs.com .                       \n                                              \n   Portfolio Management                       \n                                              \n                                              \n  Investment Adviser                          \n                                              \nSSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to   \nthe Fund.                                     \n                                              \n  Portfolio Managers                          \n                                              \nThe professionals primarily responsible for   \nthe day-to-day management of the              \nFund are Emiliano Rabinovich, Karl Schneider  \nand Olga Winner.                              \n                                              \nEmiliano Rabinovich, CFA, is a Managing       \nDirector of the                               \nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the \nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions Group.

A \nnumber of factors may affect\u00a0the Fund's       \nability to achieve a high degree of           \ncorrelation with its Index, and there         \ncan be no guarantee that\u00a0the Fund will achieve\na high degree of correlation.\u00a0For example,\u00a0the\nFund may not be able to achieve a high degree \nof correlation with its Index when there are  \npractical difficulties or substantial costs   \ninvolved in compiling a portfolio of          \nsecurities to follow the Index, when a        \nsecurity in the Index becomes temporarily     \nilliquid, unavailable or less liquid, or legal\nrestrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from\ninvesting in a security in the                \nIndex.                                        \n                                              \nThe Adviser will utilize a sampling strategy  \nin                                            \nmanaging the Fund. Sampling means that the    \nAdviser uses quantitative analysis to select  \nsecurities, including securities in the Index,\noutside of the Index and derivatives that have\na similar investment profile as the Index in  \nterms of key risk                             \nfactors, performance attributes and other     \neconomic characteristics. These include       \nindustry weightings, market capitalization,   \nand other financial characteristics of        \nsecurities. The quantity of holdings in the   \nFund will be based on a number of             \nfactors, including asset size of the Fund. In \naddition, from time to time, securities are   \nadded to or removed from the Index. The       \nAdviser may sell securities that are          \nrepresented in the Index, or purchase         \nsecurities that are not yet represented in    \nthe Index, in anticipation of their removal   \nfrom or addition to the Index. Further, the   \nAdviser may choose to overweight securities in\nthe Index, purchase or sell securities not in \nthe Index, or utilize various combinations of \nother available                               \ntechniques, in seeking to track the Index.    \n                                              \nThe Board of                                  \nTrustees of the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change\nthe Fund's investment strategy, Index and     \nother policies without shareholder approval,  \nexcept as otherwise indicated in this         \nProspectus or in the SAI. The Board may also  \nchange the Fund's                             \ninvestment objective without shareholder      \napproval.                                     \n                                              \n  Non-Principal Strategies                    \n                                              \nCertain Other Investments . The Fund may      \ninvest in structured notes (notes on which the\namount of principal repayment and interest    \npayments are based on the movement of one or  \nmore specified factors such as the movement of\na particular security or index), swaps,       \noptions and futures contracts. Swaps, options \nand futures contracts and structured notes may\nbe used by the Fund in seeking performance    \nthat corresponds to its Index and in managing \ncash flows.                                   \n                                              \nTemporary Defensive                           \nPositions . In certain situations or market   \nconditions, the Fund may temporarily depart   \nfrom its normal investment policies and       \nstrategies, provided that the alternative is  \nconsistent with the Fund's investment         \nobjective and is in the best interest of the  \nFund. For example, the Fund may make larger   \nthan normal investments in derivatives to     \nmaintain exposure to its Index if it is unable\nto invest directly in a component security.   \n                                              \nBorrowing Money . The Fund may borrow money   \nfrom a bank as permitted by the Investment    \nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), \nor other governing statute, by the Rules      \nthereunder, or by the U.S. Securities and     \nExchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other          \nregulatory agency with authority over the     \nFund, but only for temporary or emergency     \npurposes. The Fund may also invest in reverse \nrepurchase agreements, which are considered   \nborrowings under the 1940 Act. Although the   \n1940 Act presently allows the Fund to borrow  \nfrom any bank (including pledging, mortgaging \nor hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33\n1/ 3% of its total assets (not including      \ntemporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of   \nits total assets), and there is no percentage \nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in      \nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nunder normal circumstances any borrowings by  \nthe Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's    \ntotal assets.                                 \n                                              \nLending of Securities . The Fund may lend its \nportfolio securities in an amount not to      \nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets via \na securities lending program through its      \nsecurities lending agent, State Street Bank   \nand Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d or the      \n\u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers, dealers and     \nother financial institutions desiring to      \nborrow securities                             \n                      6                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nto complete transactions and for other        \npurposes. A securities lending program        \nallows the Fund to receive a portion of the   \nincome generated by lending its securities and\ninvesting the respective collateral. The Fund \nwill receive collateral for each loaned       \nsecurity which is at least equal to the market\nvalue of that security,                       \nmarked to market each trading day. In the     \nsecurities lending program, the borrower      \ngenerally has the right to vote the loaned    \nsecurities; however, the Fund may call loans  \nto vote proxies if a material issue affecting \nthe Fund's economic interest in               \nthe investment is to be voted upon. Security  \nloans may be terminated at any time by the    \nFund.                                         \n                                              \nAdditional Risk Information                   \n                                              \nThe following section provides information    \nregarding the principal risks                 \nidentified under \u201cPrincipal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund\u201d in the Fund Summary along with   \nadditional risk information.                  \n                                              \n  Principal Risks                             \n                                              \nCounterparty Risk . The Fund will be subject  \nto credit risk with respect to the            \ncounterparties with which the Fund enters into\nderivatives contracts and other transactions  \nsuch as repurchase agreements or reverse      \nrepurchase agreements. The Fund's ability to  \nprofit from these types of investments and    \ntransactions will depend on the willingness   \nand ability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations. If a counterparty fails to meet  \nits contractual obligations, the Fund may be  \nunable to terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. The Fund may experience          \nsignificant delays in obtaining any recovery  \nin an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other        \nreorganization proceeding involving its       \ncounterparty (including recovery of any       \ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in \nsuch circumstances. If the Fund holds         \ncollateral posted by its counterparty, it may \nbe delayed or prevented from realizing on the \ncollateral in the event of a bankruptcy or    \ninsolvency proceeding relating to the         \ncounterparty. Under applicable law or         \ncontractual provisions, including if the Fund \nenters into an investment or transaction with \na financial institution and such financial    \ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial \ninstitution) experiences financial            \ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain    \nsituations be prevented or delayed from       \nexercising its rights to terminate the        \ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on   \nany collateral and may result in the          \nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or       \ntransactions or in another institution being  \nsubstituted for that financial institution    \nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, the \nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under   \napplicable law whereby, if required by the    \nfinancial institution's authority, the        \nfinancial institution's liabilities could be  \nwritten down, eliminated or converted into    \nequity or an alternative instrument of        \nownership. A bail-in of a financial           \ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of its securities and, if the  \nFund holds such securities or has entered into\na transaction with such a financial security  \nwhen a bail-in occurs, the Fund may also be   \nsimilarly impacted.                           \n                                              \nDerivatives Risk. A derivative is a financial \ncontract the value of which depends on, or is \nderived from, the value of an underlying      \nasset, interest rate, or index. Derivative    \ntransactions typically involve leverage and   \nmay have significant volatility. It is        \npossible that a derivative transaction will   \nresult in a loss greater than the principal   \namount invested, and the Fund may not be able \nto close out a derivative transaction at a    \nfavorable time or price. Risks associated with\nderivative instruments include potential      \nchanges in value in response to interest rate \nchanges or other market developments or as a  \nresult of the counterparty's credit quality;  \nthe potential for the derivative transaction  \nnot to have the effect the Adviser anticipated\nor a different or less favorable effect than  \nthe Adviser anticipated; the failure of the   \ncounterparty to the derivative transaction to \nperform its obligations under the transaction \nor to settle a trade; possible mispricing or  \nimproper valuation of the derivative          \ninstrument; imperfect correlation in the value\nof a derivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that the  \nFund may be required to post collateral or    \nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be \nable to recover the collateral or margin in   \nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or \nbankruptcy; the risk that the Fund will       \nexperience losses on its derivatives          \ninvestments and on its other portfolio        \ninvestments, even when the derivatives        \ninvestments may be intended in part or        \nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for  \nthe derivative instrument, including without  \nlimitation absence of a secondary trading     \nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to  \nthe Fund due to losses on the transaction and \nan increase in volatility; the potential for  \nthe derivative transaction to have the effect \nof accelerating the recognition of gain; and  \nlegal risks arising from the documentation    \nrelating to the derivative transaction.       \n                                              \nFutures Contract Risk; Other                  \nExchange-Traded Derivatives Risk . The risk of\nloss relating to the use of futures contracts \nand other exchange-traded derivatives is      \npotentially unlimited. The ability to         \nestablish and close out positions in futures  \ncontracts and other exchange-traded           \nderivatives will be subject to the development\nand                                           \n                      7                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nmaintenance of a liquid secondary market.     \nThere is no                                   \nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an\nexchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract or other exchange-traded derivative  \nor at any particular time. In the event no    \nsuch market exists for a particular           \nderivative, it might not be                   \npossible to effect closing transactions, and  \nthe Fund will be unable to terminate the      \nderivative. In using futures contracts and    \nother exchange-traded derivatives, the Fund   \nwill be reliant on the ability of the Adviser \nto predict market and price                   \nmovements correctly; the skills needed to use \nsuch derivatives successfully are different   \nfrom those needed for traditional portfolio   \nmanagement. If the Fund uses futures contracts\nor other exchange-traded derivatives for      \nhedging purposes, there is                    \na risk of imperfect correlation between       \nmovements in the prices of the derivatives and\nmovements in the securities or index          \nunderlying the derivatives or movements in the\nprices of the Fund's investments that are the \nsubject of such hedge. The                    \nprices of futures and other exchange-traded   \nderivatives, for a number of reasons, may not \ncorrelate perfectly with movements in the     \nsecurities or index underlying them. For      \nexample, participants in the futures markets  \nand in markets for other                      \nexchange-traded derivatives are subject to    \nmargin deposit requirements. Such requirements\nmay cause investors to take actions with      \nrespect to their derivatives positions that   \nthey would not otherwise take. The margin     \nrequirements in the derivatives               \nmarkets may be less onerous than margin       \nrequirements in the securities markets in     \ngeneral, and as a result those markets may    \nattract more speculators than the securities  \nmarkets do. Increased participation by        \nspeculators in those markets may cause        \ntemporary price distortions. Due to the       \npossibility of price distortion, even a       \ncorrect forecast of general market trends by  \nthe Adviser still may not result in a         \nsuccessful derivatives activity over a very   \nshort time period. The risk of a position     \nin a futures contract or other exchange-traded\nderivative may be very large compared to the  \nrelatively low level of margin the Fund is    \nrequired to deposit. In many cases, a         \nrelatively small price movement in a futures  \ncontract may result in                        \nimmediate and substantial loss or gain to the \ninvestor relative to the size of a required   \nmargin deposit. The Fund will incur brokerage \nfees in connection with its exchange-traded   \nderivatives transactions. The Fund will       \ntypically be required to post                 \nmargin with its futures commission merchant in\nconnection with its transactions in futures   \ncontracts and other exchange-traded           \nderivatives. In the event of an insolvency of \nthe futures commission merchant or a clearing \nhouse, the Fund may not be                    \nable to recover all (or any) of the margin it \nhas posted with the futures commission        \nmerchant, or to realize the value of any      \nincrease in the price of its positions, or it \nmay experience a significant delay in doing   \nso. The Fund also may be delayed              \nor prevented from recovering margin or other  \namounts deposited with a futures commission   \nmerchant or futures clearinghouse. The        \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the     \n\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have        \nestablished limits referred                   \nto as \u201cspeculative position limits\u201d on the    \nmaximum net long or net short positions that  \nany person and certain affiliated entities may\nhold or control in a particular futures       \ncontract. Trading limits are imposed on the   \nnumber of                                     \ncontracts that any person may trade on a      \nparticular trading day. An exchange may order \nthe liquidation of positions found to be in   \nviolation of these limits and it may impose   \nsanctions or restrictions. In addition, the   \nDodd-Frank Act requires the                   \nCFTC to establish speculative position limits \non certain commodity futures contracts and    \ntheir economically equivalent futures, options\nand swaps. Regulatory action taken by the CFTC\nto establish these additional position limits \nmay adversely affect                          \nthe market liquidity of the futures, options  \nand economically equivalent derivatives in    \nwhich the Fund may invest. It is possible     \nthat, as a result of such limits, the Fund's  \nAdviser will be precluded from taking         \npositions in certain futures                  \ncontracts or over-the-counter derivatives as a\nresult of positions held by other clients of  \nthe Adviser or by the Adviser or its          \naffiliates themselves.                        \n                                              \nFutures contracts and other exchange-traded   \nderivatives traded on markets outside the U.S.\nare not generally subject to the same level of\nregulation by the CFTC or other U.S.          \nregulatory entities as contracts traded in the\nU.S., including without limitation as to the  \nexecution, delivery, and                      \nclearing of transactions. U.S. regulators     \nneither regulate the activities of a foreign  \nexchange, nor have the power to compel        \nenforcement of the rules of the foreign       \nexchange or the laws of the foreign country in\nquestion. Margin and other payments           \nmade by the Fund may not be afforded the same \nprotections as are afforded those payments in \nthe U.S., including in connection with the    \ninsolvency of an executing or clearing broker \nor a clearinghouse or exchange. Certain       \nforeign futures contracts                     \nand other exchange-traded derivatives may be  \nless liquid and more volatile than U.S.       \ncontracts.                                    \n                                              \nEquity Investing Risk . The market prices of  \nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up \nor down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.  \nThe value of a security may decline for a     \nnumber of reasons that may directly relate to \nthe issuer, such as management performance,   \nfinancial leverage, non-compliance with       \nregulatory requirements, and reduced demand   \nfor the issuer's goods or services. The values\nof equity securities also may decline due to  \ngeneral                                       \n                      8                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nindustry or market conditions that are not    \nspecifically related to a                     \nparticular company, such as real or perceived \nadverse economic conditions, changes in the   \ngeneral outlook for corporate earnings,       \nchanges in interest or currency rates, or     \nadverse investor sentiment generally. In      \naddition, equity markets tend to              \nmove in cycles, which may cause stock prices  \nto fall over short or extended periods of     \ntime.                                         \n                                              \nESG Investing Risk . An Index's incorporation \nof environmental, social and/or governance    \nconsiderations in its methodology may cause   \nthe Fund to make different investments than   \nfunds that do not incorporate such            \nconsiderations in their investment strategy or\nprocesses. An Index's incorporation of ESG    \nconsiderations may affect the Fund's exposure \nto certain sectors and/or types of            \ninvestments, and may adversely impact the     \nFund's performance depending on whether such  \nsectors or investments are in or out of favor \nin the market. In addition, a Fund's          \ninvestments in certain companies may be       \nsusceptible to various factors that may impact\ntheir businesses or operations, including     \ncosts associated with government budgetary    \nconstraints that impact publicly funded       \nprojects and clean energy initiatives, the    \neffects of general economic conditions        \nthroughout the world, increased competition   \nfrom other providers of services, unfavorable \ntax laws or accounting policies and high      \nleverage. The Index methodology incorporates  \ndata and scores provided by third parties,    \nwhich may be limited or only take into account\none or a few of many ESG related components of\nportfolio companies. In addition, ESG         \ninformation and scores across third party data\nproviders, indexes and other funds may differ \nand/or be incomparable. The Fund may invest in\ncompanies that do not reflect the beliefs and \nvalues of any particular investor.            \n                                              \nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts                                 \nRisk . The net asset value of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund's securities holdings. The  \nmarket prices of Fund Shares will generally   \nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the   \nFund's net asset value and supply and demand  \nof Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be  \npredicted whether Fund Shares will trade      \nbelow, at or above their net asset value.     \nPrice differences may be due, in large part,  \nto the fact that supply and demand forces at  \nwork in the secondary trading market for Fund \nShares will be closely related to, but not    \nidentical to, the same forces influencing the \nprices of the securities of the Index trading \nindividually or in the aggregate at any point \nin time. The market prices of Fund Shares may \ndeviate significantly from the net asset value\nof Fund Shares during periods of market       \nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares   \ncan be created and redeemed in Creation Units \n(unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable discounts     \nfrom, and sometimes at premiums to, their net \nasset value), the Adviser believes that large \ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value  \nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over   \nlong periods. While the creation/redemption   \nfeature is designed to make it likely that    \nFund Shares normally will trade close to the  \nFund's net asset value, disruptions to        \ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ      \nsignificantly from the Fund's net asset value.\nIf an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to the  \nnet asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a  \ntime when the market price is at a discount to\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, then the  \ninvestor may sustain losses.                  \n                                              \nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk . The   \nFund is managed with an indexing investment   \nstrategy, attempting to track the performance \nof an unmanaged index of securities. The Fund \nwill seek to replicate Index returns,         \nregardless of the current or projected        \nperformance of the Index or of the actual     \nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs \nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. The    \nFund generally will buy and will not sell a   \nsecurity included in the Index as long as the \nsecurity is part of the Index regardless of   \nany sudden or material decline in value or    \nforeseeable material decline in value of the  \nsecurity, even though the Adviser may make a  \ndifferent investment decision for other       \nactively managed accounts or portfolios that  \nhold the security. As a result, the Fund's    \nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms and  \nby comparison with other indices) and,        \nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index \ncomputations or the construction of the Index \nin accordance with its methodology may occur  \nfrom time to time and may not be identified   \nand corrected by the Index Provider for a     \nperiod of time or at all, which may have an   \nadverse impact on the Fund and its            \nshareholders. While the Adviser seeks to track\nthe performance of the Index (i.e., achieve a \nhigh degree of correlation with the Index),   \nthe Fund's return may not match the return of \nthe Index for a number of reasons. For        \nexample, the return on the sample of          \nsecurities purchased by the Fund (or the      \nreturn on securities not included in the      \nIndex) to replicate the performance of the    \nIndex may not correlate precisely with the    \nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number \nof operating expenses not applicable to the   \nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling \nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be  \nfully invested at times, either as a result of\ncash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves\nof cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. \nThe Adviser may attempt to                    \n                      9                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nreplicate the Index return by investing in    \nfewer than all of the securities              \nin the Index, or in some securities not       \nincluded in the Index, potentially increasing \nthe risk of divergence between the Fund's     \nreturn and that of the Index. Changes in the  \ncomposition of the Index and regulatory       \nrequirements also may impact the              \nFund's ability to match the return of the     \nIndex. The Adviser may apply one or more      \n\u201cscreens\u201d or investment techniques to refine  \nor limit the number or types of issuers       \nincluded in the Index in which the Fund may   \ninvest. Application of                        \nsuch screens or techniques may result in      \ninvestment performance below that of the Index\nand may not produce results expected by the   \nAdviser. Index tracking risk may be heightened\nduring times of increased market volatility or\nother unusual market                          \nconditions.                                   \n                                              \nPursuant to\u00a0the Index methodology, a          \nsecurity may be removed from\u00a0the Index in the \nevent that it does not comply with the        \neligibility requirements of the Index. As a   \nresult,\u00a0the Fund may be forced to sell        \nsecurities at inopportune times and/or        \nunfavorable prices due to these               \nchanges in the Index components. When there   \nare changes made to the component securities  \nof\u00a0the Index and the\u00a0Fund in turn makes       \nsimilar changes to its portfolio to attempt to\nincrease the correlation between the Fund's   \nportfolio and the                             \nIndex, any transaction costs and market       \nexposure arising from such portfolio changes  \nwill be borne directly by the Fund and its    \nshareholders. Unscheduled changes to\u00a0the Index\nmay expose the\u00a0Fund to additional tracking    \nerror risk.\u00a0The                               \nFund may recognize gains as a result of       \nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities  \nholdings to reflect changes in the securities \nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be   \nrequired to distribute any such gains to its  \nshareholders to avoid adverse                 \nfederal income tax consequences.              \n                                              \nLarge-Capitalization                          \nSecurities Risk. Securities issued by large-  \ncapitalization companies may present risks not\npresent in smaller companies. For example,    \nlarger companies may be unable to respond as  \nquickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to \ncompetitive challenges or to changes in       \nbusiness, product, financial, or other market \nconditions. Larger companies may not be able  \nto maintain growth at the high rates that may \nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-  \nsized companies, especially during strong     \neconomic periods. Returns on investments in   \nsecurities of large companies could trail the \nreturns on investments in securities of       \nsmaller and mid-sized companies.              \n                                              \nLeveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,     \nreverse repurchase agreements, certain        \nderivatives transactions, securities lending  \ntransactions and other investment transactions\nsuch as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or     \nforward commitment transactions may create    \ninvestment leverage. If the Fund engages in   \ntransactions that have a leveraging effect on \nthe Fund's investment portfolio, the value of \nthe Fund will be potentially more volatile and\nall other risks will tend to be compounded.   \nThis is because leverage generally creates    \ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base \nof assets than the Fund would otherwise have  \nand so magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to  \nbe a speculative investment practice and may  \nresult in losses to the Fund. Certain         \nderivatives have the potential for unlimited  \nloss, regardless of the size of the initial   \ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause the \nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,   \ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to \nmeet asset segregation or coverage            \nrequirements.                                 \n                                              \nLiquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk   \nthat the Fund may not be able to dispose of   \nsecurities or close out derivatives           \ntransactions readily at a favorable time or   \nprices (or at all) or at prices approximating \nthose at which the Fund currently values them.\nFor example, certain investments may be       \nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade  \nin the over-the-counter market or in limited  \nvolume, or may not have an active trading     \nmarket. Illiquid securities may trade at a    \ndiscount from comparable, more liquid         \ninvestments and may be subject to wide        \nfluctuations in market value. It may be       \ndifficult for the Fund to value illiquid      \nsecurities accurately. The market for certain \ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse \nmarket or economic conditions independent of  \nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. Disposal of illiquid  \nsecurities may entail registration expenses   \nand other transaction costs that are higher   \nthan those for liquid securities. The Fund may\nseek to borrow money to meet its obligations  \n(including among other things redemption      \nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of    \nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing  \nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund. \n                                              \nMarket Risk . Market prices of investments    \nheld by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes\nrapidly or unpredictably. The Fund's          \ninvestments are subject to changes in general \neconomic conditions, general market           \nfluctuations and the risks inherent in        \ninvestment in securities markets. Investment  \nmarkets can be volatile, and prices of        \ninvestments can change substantially due to   \nvarious factors including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in      \ninterest rates, changes in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in  \nthe Fund could decline if the particular      \nindustries, sectors or companies in which the \nFund invests do not perform well or are       \nadversely affected by events.

Local, regional or     \nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism, \nthe spread of infectious illness or other     \npublic health issues, or other events could   \nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \nAn outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by\na novel                                       \ncoronavirus (known as COVID-19) first detected\nin China in December 2019 has resulted in a   \nglobal pandemic and major disruptions to      \neconomies and markets around the world,       \nincluding the United States. Financial markets\nhave experienced extreme                      \nvolatility and severe losses, and trading in  \nmany instruments has been disrupted. Liquidity\nfor many instruments has been greatly reduced \nfor periods of time. Some interest rates are  \nvery low and in some cases yields are         \nnegative. Governments and                     \ncentral banks, including the Federal Reserve  \nin the United States, have taken extraordinary\nand unprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.   \nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective                             \nto mitigate the economic and market           \ndisruption, will not be known for some time.  \nIn addition, the outbreak of COVID-19, and    \nmeasures taken to mitigate its effects, could \nresult in disruptions to the services provided\nto the Fund by its service                    \nproviders.                                    \n                                              \nNew Fund                                      \nRisk . The Fund is new and there is no        \nassurance that the Fund will grow quickly.    \nWhen the Fund's size is small, the Fund may   \nexperience low trading volume, which could    \nlead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition,   \nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted  \nif the Fund does not meet certain conditions  \nof the listing exchange. Any resulting        \nliquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund  \nto incur elevated transaction costs for the   \nFund and negative tax consequences for its    \nshareholders.                                 \n                                              \nNon-Diversification Risk . To the extent the  \nFund becomes \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d the Fund may  \nhold a smaller number of portfolio securities \nthan many other funds. To the extent the Fund \ninvests in a relatively small number of       \nissuers, a decline in the market value of a   \nparticular security held by the Fund may      \naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund   \nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome non-diversified for periods of time    \nsolely as a result of changes in the          \ncomposition of the Index (e.g., changes in    \nweightings of one or more component           \nsecurities).                                  \n                                              \nTechnology Sector Risk . Market or economic   \nfactors impacting technology companies and    \ncompanies that rely heavily on technological  \nadvances could have a major effect on the     \nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of \nstocks of technology companies and companies  \nthat rely heavily on technology is            \nparticularly vulnerable to rapid changes in   \ntechnology product cycles, rapid product      \nobsolescence, government regulation and       \ncompetition, both domestically and            \ninternationally, including competition from   \nforeign competitors with lower production     \ncosts. Technology companies may have limited  \nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Stocks of technology companies and \ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,    \nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned    \ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the  \noverall market. Technology companies are      \nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual  \nproperty rights, the loss or impairment of    \nwhich may adversely affect profitability.     \nAdditionally, companies in the technology     \nsector may face dramatic and often            \nunpredictable changes in growth rates and     \ncompetition for the services of qualified     \npersonnel.                                    \n                                              \nUnconstrained Sector Risk . The Fund may      \ninvest a substantial portion of its assets    \nwithin one or more economic sectors or        \nindustries, which may change from time to     \ntime. When the Fund focuses its investments in\na particular industry or sector, financial,   \neconomic, business, and other developments    \naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on \nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector, \nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\n                                              \n  Non-Principal Risks                         \n                                              \nAuthorized Participants, Market Makers and    \nLiquidity Providers Concentration             \nRisk. The Fund has a limited number of        \nfinancial institutions that may act as        \nAuthorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are    \nresponsible for the creation and redemption   \nactivity for the Fund. In addition, there may \nbe a limited number of market makers and/or   \nliquidity providers in the marketplace. To the\nextent either of the following events occur,  \nFund Shares may trade at a material discount  \nto NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs   \nexit the business or otherwise become unable  \nto process creation and/or redemption orders  \nand no other APs step forward to perform these\nservices, or (ii) market makers and/or        \nliquidity providers exit the business or      \nsignificantly reduce their business activities\nand no other entities step forward to perform \ntheir functions.                              \n                      11                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nCash Transaction Risk . To the extent that the\nFund sells portfolio securities to meet some  \nor all of a redemption request with cash, the \nFund may incur taxable gains or losses that it\nmight not have incurred had it made           \nredemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, the\nFund may pay out higher annual capital gain   \ndistributions than if the in-kind redemption  \nprocess was used.                             \n                                              \nConcentration Risk . The Fund's assets will   \ngenerally be concentrated in an industry or   \ngroup of industries to the extent that the    \nFund's underlying Index concentrates in a     \nparticular industry or group of industries.   \nWhen the Fund focuses its investments in a    \nparticular industry or sector, financial,     \neconomic, business, and other developments    \naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on \nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector, \nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\n                                              \nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in  \nthe Fund will be subject to a number of actual\nor potential conflicts of interest. For       \nexample, the Adviser or its affiliates may    \nprovide services to the Fund, such as         \nsecurities lending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting   \nservices, transfer agency and shareholder     \nservicing, securities brokerage services, and \nother services for which the Fund would       \ncompensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates.\nThe Fund may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise     \naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no      \nassurance that the rates at which the Fund    \npays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its   \naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters   \ninto transactions with the Adviser or its     \naffiliates will be the most favorable         \navailable in the market generally or as       \nfavorable as the rates the Adviser or its     \naffiliates makes available to other clients.  \nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into          \ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of the \nFund with itself or its affiliates in         \ncircumstances where it might not have done so \nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable       \nregulatory requirements.                      \n                                              \nThe Adviser and its affiliates                \nserve as investment adviser to other clients  \nand may make investment decisions that may be \ndifferent from those that will be made by the \nAdviser on behalf of the Fund. For example,   \nthe Adviser may provide asset allocation      \nadvice to some clients that                   \nmay include a recommendation to invest in or  \nredeem from particular issuers while not      \nproviding that same recommendation to all     \nclients invested in the same or similar       \nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to          \napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to  \npurchase (or sell) investments for the Fund   \nand to sell (or purchase) the same investment \nfor accounts, funds, or structured products   \nfor which it serves as asset manager, or for  \nother clients or affiliates. The Adviser and  \nits affiliates may invest                     \nfor clients in various securities that are    \nsenior, pari passu or junior to, or have      \ninterests different from or adverse to, the   \nsecurities that are owned by the Fund. The    \nAdviser or its affiliates, in                 \nconnection with its other business activities,\nmay acquire material nonpublic confidential   \ninformation that may restrict the Adviser from\npurchasing securities or selling securities   \nfor itself or its clients (including the Fund)\nor otherwise using                            \nsuch information for the benefit of its       \nclients or itself.                            \n                                              \nThe foregoing does not purport to be a        \ncomprehensive list or                         \ncomplete explanation of all potential         \nconflicts of interests which may affect the   \nFund. The Fund may encounter circumstances, or\nenter into transactions, in which conflicts of\ninterest that are not listed or discussed     \nabove may arise.                              \n                                              \nCosts of Buying and Selling Shares . Investors\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket will pay brokerage commissions or other\ncharges imposed by brokers, as determined by  \nthat broker. Brokerage commissions are often a\nfixed amount and may be a significant         \nproportional cost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell relatively small amounts of Fund      \nShares. In addition, secondary market         \ninvestors will also incur the cost of the     \ndifference between the price that an investor \nis willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d  \nprice) and the price at which an investor is  \nwilling to sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price).\nThis difference in bid and ask prices is often\nreferred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask       \nspread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time  \nfor Fund Shares based on trading volume and   \nmarket liquidity, and is generally lower if   \nFund Shares have more trading volume and      \nmarket liquidity and higher if Fund Shares    \nhave little trading volume and market         \nliquidity. Further, increased market          \nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask        \nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,       \nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may           \nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making \nsmall investments.                            \n                                              \nCybersecurity Risk . With the increased use of\ntechnologies such as the Internet and the     \ndependence on computer systems to perform     \nbusiness and operational functions, funds     \n(such as the Fund) and their service providers\n(including the Adviser) may be prone to       \noperational and information security risks    \nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or           \ntechnological malfunctions. In general, cyber-\nattacks are deliberate, but unintentional     \nevents may have similar effects. Cyber-attacks\ninclude, among others, stealing or corrupting \ndata maintained online or digitally,          \npreventing legitimate                         \n                      12                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nusers from accessing information or services  \non a website, releasing                       \nconfidential information without              \nauthorization, and causing operational        \ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against, \nor security breakdowns of, the Fund, the      \nAdviser or a custodian, transfer agent, or    \nother affiliated or third-party service       \nprovider may adversely affect the Fund or its \nshareholders. For instance, cyber-attacks or  \ntechnical malfunctions may interfere with the \nprocessing of shareholder or other            \ntransactions, affect the Fund's ability to    \ncalculate its NAV, cause the                  \nrelease of private shareholder information or \nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject the    \nFund to regulatory fines, penalties or        \nfinancial losses, reimbursement or other      \ncompensation costs, and                       \nadditional compliance costs. Cyber-attacks or \ntechnical malfunctions may render records of  \nFund assets and transactions, shareholder     \nownership of Fund Shares, and other data      \nintegral to the functioning of the Fund       \ninaccessible or inaccurate or                 \nincomplete. The Fund may also incur           \nsubstantial costs for cybersecurity risk      \nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents\nin the future. The Fund and its shareholders  \ncould be negatively impacted as a result.     \nWhile the Adviser has established a           \nbusiness continuity plan and systems designed \nto minimize the risk of cyber-attacks through \nthe use of technology, processes and controls,\nthere are inherent limitations in such plans  \nand systems, including the possibility that   \ncertain risks have                            \nnot been identified, given the evolving nature\nof this threat. The Fund relies on third-party\nservice providers for many of its day-to-day  \noperations, and will be subject to the risk   \nthat the protections and protocols implemented\nby those service                              \nproviders will be ineffective to protect the  \nFund from cyber-attack. The Adviser does not  \ncontrol the cybersecurity plans and systems   \nput in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may    \nhave limited                                  \nindemnification obligations to the Adviser or \nthe Fund. Similar types of cybersecurity risks\nor technical malfunctions also are present for\nissuers of securities in which the Fund       \ninvests, which could result in material       \nadverse consequences for such                 \nissuers, and may cause the Fund's investment  \nin such securities to lose value.             \n                                              \nIndex Construction Risk . A security included \nin the Index may not exhibit the              \ncharacteristic or provide the specific        \nexposure for which it was selected and        \nconsequently the Fund's holdings may not      \nexhibit returns consistent with that          \ncharacteristic or exposure.                   \n                                              \nIndex Licensing Risk . It is possible that the\nlicense under which the Adviser or the Fund is\npermitted to replicate or otherwise use the   \nIndex will be terminated or may be disputed,  \nimpaired or cease to remain in effect. In such\na case, the Adviser may be required to replace\nthe Index with another index which it         \nconsiders to be appropriate in light of the   \ninvestment strategy of the Fund. The use of   \nany such substitute index may have an adverse \nimpact on the Fund's performance. In the event\nthat the Adviser is unable to identify a      \nsuitable replacement for the Index, it may    \ndetermine to terminate the Fund.              \n                                              \nMoney Market Risk . An investment in a money  \nmarket fund is not a deposit of any bank and  \nis not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or   \nany other government agency. Certain money    \nmarket funds seek to preserve the value of    \ntheir shares at $1.00 per share, although     \nthere can be no assurance that they will do   \nso, and it is possible to lose money by       \ninvesting in such a money market fund. A major\nor unexpected increase in interest rates or a \ndecline in the credit quality of an issuer or \nentity providing credit support, an inactive  \ntrading market for money market instruments,  \nor adverse market, economic, industry,        \npolitical, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause the share price of such\na money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will   \nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at \ntimes when the fair value of the money market \nfund's portfolio per share is more or less    \nthan $1.00. None of State Street Corporation, \nState Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState   \nStreet\u201d), State Street Global Advisors, Inc.  \n(\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (\u201cState \nStreet Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an   \ninvestment in a money market fund at $1.00 per\nshare. Investors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from   \nState Street Entities. Other money market     \nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV  \nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the \nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or \nless than their original purchase price.      \nRecent changes in the regulation of money     \nmarket funds may affect the operations and    \nstructures of money market funds. A money     \nmarket fund may be permitted or required to   \nimpose redemption fees or to impose           \nlimitations on redemptions during periods of  \nhigh illiquidity in the markets for the       \ninvestments held by it.                       \n                      13                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nPortfolio Turnover Risk . The Fund may engage \nin frequent trading of its portfolio          \nsecurities. Fund turnover generally involves a\nnumber of direct and indirect costs and       \nexpenses to the Fund, including, for example, \nbrokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and    \nbid/asked spreads, and transaction costs on   \nthe sale of securities and reinvestment in    \nother securities. The costs related to        \nincreased portfolio turnover have the effect  \nof reducing the Fund's investment return, and \nthe sale of securities by the Fund may result \nin the realization of taxable capital gains,  \nincluding short-term capital gains.           \n                                              \nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend    \nportfolio securities in an amount not to      \nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the  \nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any \ntime. Any such loans must be continuously     \nsecured by collateral maintained on a current \nbasis in an amount at least equal to the      \nmarket value of the securities loaned by the  \nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a \nloan transaction, as compensation for lending \nits securities, the Fund will receive a       \nportion of the dividends or interest accrued  \non the securities held as collateral or, in   \nthe case of cash collateral, a portion of the \nincome from the investment of such cash. In   \naddition, the Fund will receive the amount of \nall dividends, interest and other             \ndistributions on the loaned securities.       \nHowever, the borrower has the right to vote   \nthe loaned securities. The Fund will call     \nloans to vote proxies if a material issue     \naffecting the investment is to be voted upon. \nEfforts to recall such securities promptly may\nbe unsuccessful, especially for foreign       \nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and   \nmay involve expenses to the Fund. Securities  \nlending involves the risk that the Fund may   \nlose money because the borrower of the loaned \nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. Should the borrower  \nof the securities fail financially, the Fund  \nmay experience delays in recovering the       \nsecurities or exercising its rights in the    \ncollateral. Loans are made only to borrowers  \nthat are deemed by the securities lending     \nagent to be of good financial standing. In a  \nloan transaction, the Fund will also bear the \nrisk of any decline in value of securities    \nprovided as collateral or acquired with cash  \ncollateral. The Fund will attempt to minimize \nthis risk by limiting the investment of cash  \ncollateral to high quality instruments of     \nshort maturity either directly on behalf of   \nthe lending Fund or through one or more joint \naccounts or funds, which may include those    \nmanaged by the Adviser. To the extent the     \ncollateral provided or investments made with  \ncash collateral differ from securities        \nincluded in the Index, such collateral or     \ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss   \nthan the securities included in the Index. In \naddition, the Fund will be subject to the risk\nthat any income generated by lending its      \nsecurities or reinvesting cash collateral is  \nlower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay\na borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute  \npayments for dividends when overseeing the    \nFund's securities lending activity.           \n                                              \nTrading Issues . Although Fund Shares are     \nlisted for trading on the Exchange and may be \nlisted or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock   \nexchanges other than the Exchange, there can  \nbe no assurance that an active trading market \nfor the Fund Shares will develop or be        \nmaintained. Trading in Fund Shares on the     \nExchange may be halted due to market          \nconditions or for reasons that, in the view of\nthe Exchange, make trading in Fund Shares     \ninadvisable. In addition, trading in Fund     \nShares on the Exchange is subject to trading  \nhalts caused by extraordinary market          \nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit      \nbreaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of      \noperating companies listed on a stock         \nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and   \nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's \nshares. While the Fund expects that the       \nability of Authorized Participants to create  \nand redeem Fund Shares at net asset value     \nshould be effective in reducing any such      \nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such \nshort sales. There can be no assurance that   \nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to \nmaintain the listing of the Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that    \nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at \nall, on any stock exchange.                   \n                                              \n   Management                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Investment Adviser                          \n                                              \nSSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to   \nthe Fund and, subject to the                  \noversight of the Board, is responsible for the\ninvestment management of the Fund. The Adviser\nprovides an investment management program for \nthe Fund and manages the investment of the    \nFund's assets. The Adviser is a wholly-owned  \nsubsidiary of State                           \nStreet Global Advisors, Inc., which itself is \na wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street     \nCorporation. The Adviser is registered with   \nthe SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of  \n1940, as amended. The Adviser and certain     \nother affiliates of State                     \nStreet                                        \n                      14                      \nTable of Contents                             \nCorporation make up SSGA. SSGA is one of the\nworld's largest institutional money managers\nand the investment management arm of State\nStreet Corporation. As of June 30, 2020, the\nAdviser managed approximately $612.89 billion\nin assets and SSGA managed approximately $3.05\ntrillion in assets. The Adviser's principal\nbusiness address is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. For the services provided\nto the Fund under the Investment Advisory\nAgreement, the Fund expects to pay the Adviser\nthe annual fee based on a percentage of the\nFund's average daily net assets as set forth\nbelow:\n                          \n  SPDR             0.10%  \n  S&P 500 ESG ETF         \n                          \nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all\nor a portion of its management fee. The\nAdviser pays all expenses of the Fund other\nthan the management fee, brokerage expenses,\ntaxes, interest, fees and expenses of the\nIndependent Trustees (including any Trustee's\ncounsel fees), litigation expenses, acquired\nfund fees and expenses and other extraordinary\nexpenses. A summary of the factors considered\nby the Board in connection with the initial\napproval of the Investment Advisory Agreement\nfor the Fund will be available in the Fund's\nsemi-annual report for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2020. SSGA FM, as the investment\nadviser for the Fund, may hire one or more\nsub-advisers to oversee the day-to-day\ninvestment activities of the Fund. The sub-\nadvisers are subject to oversight by the\nAdviser. The Adviser and SPDR Series Trust\n(the \u201cTrust\u201d) have received an exemptive order\nfrom the SEC that permits the Adviser, with\nthe approval of the Independent Trustees of\nthe Trust, to retain and amend existing sub-\nadvisory agreements with unaffiliated\ninvestment sub-advisers for the Fund without\nsubmitting the sub-advisory agreement to a\nvote of the Fund's shareholders. The Trust\nwill notify shareholders in the event of any\nchange in the identity of such sub-adviser or\nsub-advisers. The Adviser has ultimate\nresponsibility for the investment performance\nof the Fund due to its responsibility to\noversee each sub-adviser and recommend their\nhiring, termination and replacement. The\nAdviser is not required to disclose fees paid\nto any unaffiliated sub-adviser retained\npursuant to the order. Portfolio Managers.\nThe Adviser manages the Fund using a team of\ninvestment professionals. The team approach is\nused to create an environment that encourages\nthe flow of investment ideas. The portfolio\nmanagers within the team work together in a\ncohesive manner to develop and enhance\ntechniques that drive the investment process\nfor the investment strategy. This approach\nrequires portfolio managers to share a variety\nof responsibilities including investment\nstrategy and analysis while retaining\nresponsibility for the implementation of the\nstrategy within any particular portfolio. The\napproach also enables the team to draw upon\nthe resources of other groups within SSGA. The\nportfolio management team is overseen by the\nSSGA Investment Committee. The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Emiliano\nRabinovich, Karl Schneider and Olga Winner.\nEmiliano Rabinovich, CFA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Global Equity Beta Solutions\nGroup.

The number of Fund Shares  \nrequired for a Creation Unit is stated        \nin\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cPurchase and Sale of Information\u201d     \nsection above. Only an AP may purchase or     \nredeem Creation Units directly with the Fund, \nin accordance                                 \nwith the procedures described in the SAI.     \nExcept when aggregated in Creation Units,     \nShares are not redeemable by the Fund. The    \nprices at which creations and redemptions     \noccur are based on the next calculation of NAV\nafter a creation or redemption                \norder is received in acceptable form under the\nauthorized participant agreement. The net     \nasset value of the Fund is calculated by State\nStreet and determined as of the close of the  \nregular trading session on the New York Stock \nExchange (ordinarily                          \n4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each day that such \nexchange is open.                             \n                                              \nAn AP may purchase a Creation Unit of the Fund\non any business                               \nday in exchange for the delivery of a         \ndesignated portfolio of in-kind securities    \nand/or cash approximating the holdings of the \nFund. An AP may redeem a Creation Unit of the \nFund on any business day. Redemption proceeds \nfor a Creation Unit will                      \nconsist of portfolio securities and/or cash.  \nThis method is used during both normal and    \nstressed market conditions. Cash used for     \nredemptions will be                           \n                      17                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nraised from the sale of portfolio assets or   \nmay come from existing holdings               \nof cash or cash equivalents. When purchasing  \nor redeeming Creation Units, APs are also     \nrequired to pay a fixed purchase or redemption\ntransaction fee as well as any applicable     \nadditional variable charge, as described in   \nthe SAI.                                      \n                                              \nUnder normal circumstances, the Fund will pay \nout redemption                                \nproceeds to a redeeming AP within two days    \nafter the AP's redemption request is received,\nin accordance with the process set forth in   \nthe Fund's SAI and in the agreement between   \nthe AP and the Distributor. However, the Fund \nreserves the right,                           \nincluding under stressed market conditions, to\ntake up to seven days after the receipt of a  \nredemption request to pay an AP, as permitted \nby the 1940 Act, and, in certain              \ncircumstances, up to fifteen days with respect\nto foreign securities as                      \npermitted by an SEC exemptive order.          \n                                              \nFund Shares are                               \nlisted for secondary trading on the Exchange  \nand individual Fund Shares may only be        \npurchased and sold in the secondary market    \nthrough a broker-dealer. The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally \nclosed on the following                       \nholidays: New Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther   \nKing, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday,  \nMemorial Day (observed), Independence Day,    \nLabor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.\nThe Exchange may close early on the business  \nday before certain                            \nholidays and on the day after Thanksgiving    \nDay. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to\nchange without notice. If you buy or sell Fund\nShares in the secondary market, you will pay  \nthe secondary market price for Fund Shares. In\naddition, you may                             \nincur customary brokerage commissions and     \ncharges and may pay some or all of the spread \nbetween the bid and the offered price in the  \nsecondary market on each leg of a round trip  \n(purchase and sale) transaction.              \n                                              \nThe trading prices of Fund Shares will        \nfluctuate continuously                        \nthroughout trading hours based on market      \nsupply and demand rather than the Fund's net  \nasset value, which is calculated at the end of\neach business day. Fund Shares will trade on  \nthe Exchange at prices that may be above ( i.e\n., at a premium) or below ( i.e ., at a       \ndiscount), to varying degrees, the daily net  \nasset value of Fund Shares. The trading prices\nof Fund Shares may deviate significantly      \nfrom the Fund's net asset value during periods\nof market volatility. Given, however, that    \nFund Shares can be issued and redeemed daily  \nin Creation Units, the Adviser believes that  \nlarge discounts and premiums to net asset     \nvalue should not be                           \nsustained over long periods. Information      \nshowing the number of days the market price of\nFund Shares was greater than the Fund's net   \nasset value and the number of days it was less\nthan the Fund's net asset value               \n( i.e ., premium or discount) for various time\nperiods is available by visiting the Fund's   \nwebsite at https://www.spdrs.com .            \n                                              \nThe Exchange will disseminate, every fifteen  \nseconds during                                \nthe regular trading day, an indicative        \noptimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to\nthe Fund. The IOPV calculations are estimates \nof the value of the Fund's net asset value per\nFund Share. Premiums and discounts between the\nIOPV and                                      \nthe market price may occur. This should not be\nviewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net     \nasset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is based \non the current market value of the published  \nbasket of portfolio securities and/or cash    \nrequired to be                                \ndeposited in exchange for a Creation Unit and \ndoes not necessarily reflect the precise      \ncomposition of\u00a0the Fund's actual portfolio at \na particular point in time. Moreover, the IOPV\nis generally determined by using current      \nmarket quotations                             \nand/or price quotations obtained from broker- \ndealers and other market intermediaries and   \nvaluations based on current market rates. The \nIOPV may not be calculated in the same manner \nas the NAV, which (i) is computed only once a \nday, (ii) unlike the                          \ncalculation of the IOPV, takes into account   \nFund expenses, and (iii) may be subject, in   \naccordance with the requirements of the 1940  \nAct, to fair valuation at different prices    \nthan those used in the calculations of the    \nIOPV. When applicable, the                    \nIOPV price is based on quotes and closing     \nprices from the securities' local market      \nconverted into U.S. dollars at the current    \ncurrency rates and may not reflect events that\noccur subsequent to the local market's close. \nTherefore, the IOPV may not                   \nreflect the best possible valuation of the    \nFund's current portfolio. Neither the Fund nor\nthe Adviser or any of their affiliates are    \ninvolved in, or responsible for, the          \ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and\nmake no warranty as to their                  \naccuracy.                                     \n                                              \nThe Fund does not impose any restrictions on  \nthe frequency of purchases and redemptions;   \nhowever, the Fund reserves the right to reject\nor limit purchases at any time as described in\nthe SAI. When considering that no restriction \nor policy was necessary, the Board evaluated  \nthe risks posed by                            \nmarket timing activities, such as whether     \nfrequent purchases and redemptions would      \ninterfere with the efficient implementation of\nthe Fund's investment strategy, or whether    \nthey would cause the Fund to experience       \nincreased transaction costs. The              \nBoard considered that, unlike traditional     \nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and      \nredeemed only in large quantities of shares   \nknown as Creation Units, available only from  \nthe Fund directly, and that most trading in   \nthe Fund occurs on the Exchange               \nat prevailing market prices and does not      \ninvolve the Fund directly. Given this         \nstructure, the Board determined that it is    \nunlikely that (a) market timing would be      \nattempted by the Fund's shareholders or (b)   \nany attempts to market time the Fund by       \nshareholders would result in negative impact  \nto the Fund or its shareholders.              \n                      18                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nDistributions                                 \n                                              \nDividends and Capital Gains.

These amounts, net \nof expenses and taxes (if applicable), are    \npassed along to Fund shareholders as \u201cincome  \ndividend distributions.\u201d The Fund will        \ngenerally realize                             \nshort-term capital gains or losses whenever it\nsells or exchanges assets held for one year or\nless. Net short-term capital gains will       \ngenerally be treated as ordinary income when  \ndistributed to shareholders. The Fund will    \ngenerally realize long-term                   \ncapital gains or losses whenever it sells or  \nexchanges assets held for more than one year. \nNet capital gains (the excess of the Fund's   \nnet long-term capital gains over its net      \nshort-term capital losses) are distributed to \nshareholders as                               \n\u201ccapital gain distributions.\u201d                 \n                                              \nIncome                                        \ndividend distributions, if any, are generally \ndistributed to shareholders quarterly, but may\nvary significantly from period to period.     \n                                              \nNet capital gains for the Fund are distributed\nat least                                      \nannually.

Your \ninvestment in the Fund may have other tax     \nimplications. Please consult your tax advisor \nabout federal, state, local, foreign or other \ntax laws applicable                           \nto you.

In general, your      \ndistributions are subject to federal income   \ntax when they are paid, whether you take them \nin cash or reinvest them in the Fund. The     \nincome dividends and short-term capital gains \ndistributions you receive from the Fund will  \nbe taxed as either ordinary income or         \nqualified dividend income. Subject to certain \nlimitations, dividends that are reported by   \nthe Fund as qualified dividend income are     \ntaxable to noncorporate shareholders at rates \nof up to 20%. Any distributions of the Fund's \nnet capital gains are taxable as long-term    \ncapital gain regardless of how long you have  \nowned Fund Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders  \nat rates of up to 20%. Distributions in excess\nof the Fund's current and accumulated earnings\nand profits are treated as a tax-free return  \nof capital to the extent of your basis in the \nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital    \ngain thereafter.                              \n                                              \nIn general, dividends may be reported by the  \nFund as qualified                             \ndividend income if they are attributable to   \nqualified dividend income received by the     \nFund, which, in general, includes dividend    \nincome from taxable U.S. corporations and     \ncertain foreign corporations ( i.e .,         \ncertain foreign corporations incorporated in a\npossession of the United States or in certain \ncountries with a comprehensive tax treaty with\nthe United States, and certain other foreign  \ncorporations if the stock with respect to     \nwhich the dividend is                         \npaid is readily tradable on an established    \nsecurities market in the United States),      \nprovided that the Fund satisfies certain      \nholding period requirements in respect of the \nstock of such corporations and has not hedged \nits position in the stock in                  \ncertain ways. A dividend generally will not be\ntreated as qualified dividend income if the   \ndividend is received with respect to any share\nof stock held by the Fund for fewer than 61   \ndays during the 121-day period beginning at   \nthe date which is 60                          \ndays before the date on which such share      \nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such      \ndividend\u00a0or, in the case of certain preferred \nstock, for fewer than 91 days                 \n                      19                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nduring the 181-day period beginning 90 days   \nbefore such date. These holding               \nperiod requirements will also apply to your   \nownership of Fund Shares. Holding periods may \nbe suspended for these purposes for stock that\nis hedged. Additionally, income derived in    \nconnection with the Fund's securities lending \nactivities will not be                        \ntreated as qualified dividend income.         \n                                              \nU.S. individuals                              \nwith income exceeding specified thresholds are\nsubject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on\nall or a portion of their \u201cnet investment     \nincome,\u201d which includes taxable interest,     \ndividends and certain capital gains (generally\nincluding                                     \ncapital gain distributions and capital gains  \nrealized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This  \n3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of  \nthe undistributed net investment income of    \ncertain shareholders that are estates and     \ntrusts.                                       \n                                              \nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions   \nwill be subject to                            \na 1.4% tax on net investment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain  \ndistributions, and certain gains from the     \ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other       \ncategories of income), are generally taken    \ninto account in computing a                   \nshareholder's net investment income.          \n                                              \nIf you lend your                              \nFund Shares pursuant to securities lending    \narrangements you may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares are\nheld by the borrower) as qualified dividend   \nincome. You should consult your financial     \nintermediary or tax                           \nadvisor to discuss your particular            \ncircumstances.                                \n                                              \nDistributions paid in January, but declared by\nthe Fund in                                   \nOctober, November or December of the previous \nyear, payable to shareholders of record in    \nsuch a month, may be taxable to you in the    \ncalendar year in which they were declared. The\nFund will inform you of the amount of your    \nordinary income dividends,                    \nqualified dividend income and capital gain    \ndistributions shortly after the close of each \ncalendar year.                                \n                                              \nA distribution will reduce the Fund's net     \nasset value per Fund                          \nShare and may be taxable to you as ordinary   \nincome or capital gain even though, from an   \ninvestment standpoint, the distribution may   \nconstitute a return of capital.               \n                                              \nDerivatives and Other Complex Securities. The \nFund may invest in complex securities. These  \ninvestments may be subject to numerous special\nand complex rules. These rules could affect   \nwhether gains and losses recognized by the    \nFund are treated as ordinary income or capital\ngain, accelerate the recognition of income to \nthe Fund and/or defer the Fund's ability to   \nrecognize losses. In turn, these rules may    \naffect the amount, timing or character of the \nincome distributed to you by the Fund. You    \nshould consult your personal tax advisor      \nregarding the application of these rules.     \n                                              \nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any     \ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of  \nFund Shares is generally treated as long-term \ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been \nheld for more than one year and as short-term \ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been \nheld for one year or less, except that any    \ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held  \nfor six months or less is treated as long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain  \ndividends were paid with respect to the Fund  \nShares.                                       \n                                              \nTaxes on Creations and Redemptions of         \nCreation Units. A person who exchanges        \nsecurities for Creation Units generally will  \nrecognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss    \nwill be equal to the difference between the   \nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time\nand the exchanger's aggregate basis in the    \nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for \nthe Creation Units. A person who exchanges    \nCreation Units for securities will generally  \nrecognize a gain or loss equal to the         \ndifference between the exchanger's basis in   \nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market   \nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The Internal Revenue Service (the   \n\u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss       \nrealized upon an exchange of securities for   \nCreation Units cannot be deducted currently   \nunder the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on \nthe basis that there has been no significant  \nchange in economic position. Persons          \nexchanging securities should consult their own\ntax advisor with respect to whether wash sale \nrules apply and when a loss might be          \ndeductible.                                   \n                                              \nUnder current federal tax laws, any capital   \ngain or loss                                  \nrealized upon a redemption (or creation) of   \nCreation Units is generally treated as long-  \nterm capital gain or loss if the Fund Shares  \n(or securities surrendered) have been held for\nmore than one year and as a short-term capital\ngain or loss if the                           \nFund Shares (or securities surrendered) have  \nbeen held for one year or less.               \n                                              \nIf you create or redeem Creation Units, you   \nwill be sent a                                \nconfirmation statement showing how many Fund  \nShares you purchased or sold and at what      \nprice.                                        \n                      20                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nThe Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has the     \nright to reject an                            \norder for Creation Units if the purchaser (or \na group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining  \nthe Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of\nthe outstanding shares of the\u00a0Fund and if,    \npursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the\u00a0Fund \nwould have a                                  \nbasis in the securities different from the    \nmarket value of the securities on the date of \ndeposit.\u00a0 The Trust also has the right to     \nrequire information necessary to determine    \nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80%                                           \ndetermination.\u00a0 If the Trust does issue       \nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of  \npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the    \nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the\u00a0Fund, the purchaser \n(or group of                                  \npurchasers) will not recognize gain or loss   \nupon the exchange of securities for Creation  \nUnits.                                        \n                                              \nIf the Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it\nmay bear                                      \nadditional costs and recognize more capital   \ngains than it would if it redeems Creation    \nUnits in-kind.                                \n                                              \nNon-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income dividends \npaid by the Fund to shareholders who are non- \nresident aliens or foreign entities will      \ngenerally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax (other than distributions reported by the \nFund as interest-related dividends and short- \nterm capital gain dividends), unless a lower  \ntreaty rate applies or unless such income is  \neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or    \nbusiness. In general, the Fund may report     \ninterest-related dividends to the extent of   \nits net income derived from U.S. source       \ninterest, and the Fund may report short-term  \ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net  \nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year  \nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains \non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that \nare, in each case, effectively connected with \nthe conduct of a trade or business within the \nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax     \nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,        \ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of the   \nFund's shares are urged to consult their own  \ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment.                \n                                              \nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold    \nFund Shares comply                            \nwith IRS requirements that will generally     \nrequire them to report information regarding  \nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply\u00a0to distributions payable to such        \nentities. A non-U.S.                          \nshareholder may be exempt from the withholding\ndescribed in this paragraph under an          \napplicable intergovernmental agreement between\nthe U.S. and a foreign government, provided   \nthat the shareholder and the applicable       \nforeign government comply with the            \nterms of such agreement.                      \n                                              \nBackup Withholding. The Fund will be required \nin certain cases to withhold (as \u201cbackup      \nwithholding\u201d) on amounts payable to any       \nshareholder who (1) has provided the Fund     \neither an incorrect tax identification number \nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup \nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3) \nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such   \nshareholder is not subject to backup          \nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that    \nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding  \nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been     \nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on         \nshareholders who are neither citizens nor     \npermanent residents of the United States.     \n                                              \nCertain Potential Tax Reporting Requirements. \nUnder U.S. Treasury regulations, if a         \nshareholder recognizes a loss of $2 million or\nmore for an individual shareholder or $10     \nmillion or more for a corporate shareholder   \n(or certain greater amounts over a combination\nof years), the shareholder must file with the \nIRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886.      \nDirect shareholders of portfolio securities   \nare in many cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance       \nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted.       \nSignificant penalties may be imposed for the  \nfailure to comply with the reporting          \nrequirements. The fact that a loss is         \nreportable under these regulations does not   \naffect the legal determination of whether the \ntaxpayer's treatment of the loss is proper.   \nShareholders should consult their tax advisors\nto determine the applicability of these       \nregulations in light of their individual      \ncircumstances.                                \n                                              \nOther Tax Issues. The Fund may be subject to  \ntax in certain states where the Fund does     \nbusiness (or is treated as doing business as a\nresult of its investments). Furthermore, in   \nthose states which have income tax laws, the  \ntax treatment of the Fund and of Fund         \nshareholders with respect to distributions by \nthe Fund may differ from federal tax          \ntreatment.                                    \n                                              \nThe foregoing discussion summarizes some of   \nthe consequences                              \nunder current federal income tax law of an    \ninvestment in the Fund.

The Trust was\norganized as a Massachusetts business trust on\nJune 12, 1998. The offering of the\nFund\u0092s shares (\u0093Shares\u0094) is registered under\nthe Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\n\u0093Securities Act\u0094). The investment objective of\nthe Fund is to provide investment results\nthat, before fees and expenses, correspond\ngenerally to the total return performance of a\nspecified market index (the \u0093Index\u0094). SSGA\nFunds Management, Inc. serves as the\ninvestment adviser for the Fund (\u0093SSGA FM\u0094 or\nthe \u0093Adviser\u0094).\n\nThe Fund offers and issues Shares at its net\nasset value (sometimes referred to herein as\n\u0093NAV\u0094) only in aggregations of a specified\nnumber of\nShares (each, a \u0093Creation Unit\u0094). The Fund\ngenerally offers and issues Shares either in\nexchange for (i) a basket of securities\nincluded in its Index (\u0093Deposit Securities\u0094)\ntogether with the deposit of a specified cash\npayment (\u0093Cash Component\u0094) or (ii) a cash\npayment equal in value to the Deposit\nSecurities (\u0093Deposit Cash\u0094) together with the\nCash Component. The primary consideration\naccepted by the Fund (i.e., Deposit Securities\nor\nDeposit Cash) is set forth under \u0093PURCHASE AND\nREDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\u0094 later in this\nSAI. The Trust reserves the right to permit or\nrequire the substitution of a \u0093cash in lieu\u0094\namount to be added to the Cash Component to\nreplace any Deposit Security and reserves the\nright to permit or require the substitution of\nDeposit Securities in lieu of Deposit Cash\n(subject to applicable legal requirements).\nThe Shares have been approved for listing and\nsecondary trading on a\nnational securities exchange (the \u0093Exchange\u0094).\nThe Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nmarket prices. These prices may differ from\nthe Shares\u0092 net asset values. The Shares are\nalso redeemable only in Creation Unit\naggregations, and\ngenerally in exchange either for (i) portfolio\nsecurities and a specified cash payment or\n(ii) cash (subject to applicable legal\nrequirements). A Creation Unit of the Fund\nconsists of 25,000 shares.\n\nShares may be issued in advance of receipt of\nDeposit Securities subject to various\nconditions including a requirement to maintain\non deposit with the Trust\ncash at least equal to a specified percentage\nof the market value of the missing Deposit\nSecurities, as set forth in the Participant\nAgreement (as defined below). See \u0093PURCHASE\nAND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS.\u0094 The Trust\nmay impose a\ntransaction fee for each creation or\nredemption. In all cases, such fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u0093SEC\u0094) applicable to management investment\ncompanies offering\nredeemable securities. In addition to the\nfixed creation or redemption transaction fee,\nan additional transaction fee of up to three\ntimes the fixed creation or redemption\ntransaction fee and/or an additional variable\ncharge may apply.\n\nINVESTMENT POLICIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in the following types of\ninvestments, consistent with its investment\nstrategies and objective. Please see the\nFund\u0092s Prospectus for\nadditional information regarding its principal\ninvestment strategies.\n\nDIVERSIFICATION STATUS\n\nThe Fund is classified as a diversified\ninvestment company under the 1940 Act. Under\nthe 1940 Act, a diversified investment\ncompany, as to 75% of its total\nassets, may not purchase securities of any\nissuer (other than securities issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, its agents\nor instrumentalities or securities of other\ninvestment companies) if, as a result, more\nthan 5% of its total assets\nwould be invested in the securities of such\nissuer, or more than 10% of the issuer\u0092s\noutstanding voting securities would be held by\nthe investment company.\n\nThe Fund seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex. The composition of the Index may\nfluctuate between diversified and\nnon-diversified solely due to changes in\nweightings of one or more Index components. As\na result, the Fund\u0092s diversification status\nalso may fluctuate between diversified and\nnon-diversified depending on the composition\nof, and to approximately the same extent as,\nthe Index. To the extent the Fund becomes non-\ndiversified due solely to changes in\nthe composition of the Index, the Fund will\nnot seek shareholder approval if and when the\nFund shifts from diversified to non-\ndiversified.\n\nThe Fund intends to maintain the required\nlevel of diversification and otherwise conduct\nits operations so as to qualify as a\n\u0093regulated investment\ncompany\u0094 (\u0093RIC\u0094) for purposes of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\u0093Internal Revenue Code\u0094), and to relieve the\nFund of any liability for federal income tax\nto the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to\nshareholders. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may severely limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective.\n\nCOMMON STOCK\n\nRisks inherent in investing in equity\nsecurities\ninclude the risk that the financial condition\nof issuers may become impaired or that the\ngeneral condition of the stock market may\ndeteriorate (either of which may cause a\ndecrease in the value of the Fund\u0092s portfolio\n\n3\n\nsecurities and therefore a decrease in the\nvalue of Shares of the Fund). Common stock is\nsusceptible to general stock market\nfluctuations and to volatile increases and\ndecreases in value as\nmarket confidence and perceptions change.\nThese investor perceptions are based on\nvarious and unpredictable factors, including\nexpectations regarding government, economic,\nmonetary and fiscal policies; inflation and\ninterest rates; economic\nexpansion or contraction; and global or\nregional political, economic or banking\ncrises.\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\nThe Fund will concentrate its investments in\nsecurities of issuers in the same industry as\nmay be necessary to approximate the\ncomposition of the Fund\u0092s\nunderlying Index. The securities of issuers in\nparticular industries may dominate the\nbenchmark Index of the Fund and consequently\nthe Fund\u0092s investment portfolio. This may\nadversely affect the Fund\u0092s performance or\nsubject its Shares to\ngreater price volatility than that experienced\nby less concentrated investment companies. The\nTrust\u0092s general policy is to exclude\nsecurities of the U.S. government and its\nagencies or instrumentalities when measuring\nindustry concentration.\n\nIn pursuing its objective, the Fund may hold\nthe securities of a single issuer in an amount\nexceeding 10% of the market value of the\noutstanding\nsecurities of the issuer, subject to\nrestrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue\nCode. In particular, as the Fund\u0092s size grows\nand its assets increase, it will be more\nlikely to hold more than 10% of the securities\nof a single issuer if the\nissuer has a relatively small public float as\ncompared to other components in its benchmark\nIndex.\n\nCONVERTIBLE SECURITIES\n\nConvertible securities are bonds, debentures,\nnotes, preferred stocks or other securities\nthat may be converted or exchanged (by the\nholder or by the issuer)\ninto shares of the underlying common stock (or\ncash or securities of equivalent value) at a\nstated exchange ratio. A convertible security\nmay also be called for redemption or\nconversion by the issuer after a particular\ndate and under certain\ncircumstances (including a specified price)\nestablished upon issue. If a convertible\nsecurity held by the Fund is called for\nredemption or conversion, the Fund could be\nrequired to tender it for redemption, convert\nit into the underlying common\nstock, or sell it to a third party.\n\nConvertible securities generally have less\npotential for gain or loss than common stock.\nConvertible securities\ngenerally provide yields higher than\nunderlying common stock, but generally lower\nthan comparable non-convertible securities.\nBecause of this higher yield, convertible\nsecurities generally sell at a price\nabove their \u0093conversion value,\u0094 which is the\ncurrent market value of the stock to be\nreceived upon conversion. The difference\nbetween this conversion value and the price of\nconvertible securities will vary over time\ndepending on changes in\nthe value of the underlying common stock and\ninterest rates. When the underlying common\nstock declines in value, convertible\nsecurities will tend not to decline to the\nsame extent because of the interest or\ndividend payments and the repayment of\nprincipal at maturity for certain types of\nconvertible securities. However, securities\nthat are convertible other than at the option\nof the holder generally do not limit the\npotential for loss to the same extent as\nsecurities convertible at the\noption of the holder. When the underlying\ncommon stock rises in value, the value of\nconvertible securities may also be expected to\nincrease. At the same time, however, the\ndifference between the market value of\nconvertible securities and their\nconversion value will narrow, which means that\nthe value of convertible securities will\ngenerally not increase to the same extent as\nthe value of the underlying common stock.\nBecause convertible securities may also be\ninterest-rate sensitive, their\nvalue may increase as interest rates fall and\ndecrease as interest rates rise. Convertible\nsecurities are also subject to credit risk,\nand are often lower-quality securities.\n\nFUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may\ninvest up to 20% of its assets in derivatives,\nincluding exchange-traded futures on\nTreasuries or Eurodollars, U.S. exchange-\ntraded or OTC put and call options contracts\nand exchange-traded or OTC swap transactions\n(including NDFs interest rate\nswaps, total return swaps, excess return\nswaps, and credit default swaps). The Fund\nwill segregate cash and/or appropriate liquid\nassets if required to do so by SEC or CFTC\nregulation or interpretation.\n\nRecent legislation calls for new regulation of\nthe derivatives markets. The extent and impact\nof the regulation is not yet fully known and\nmay not be for some\ntime. New regulations could adversely affect\nthe value, availability and performance of\ncertain derivative instruments, may make them\nmore costly, and may limit or restrict their\nuse by the Fund.\n\nFutures contracts generally provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified commodity or\nsecurity at a specified future\ntime and at a specified price. Index futures\ncontracts are settled daily with a payment by\none party to the other of a cash amount based\non the difference between the level of the\nindex specified in the contract from one day\nto the next. A futures\ncontract on an index is an agreement pursuant\nto which two parties agree to take or make\ndelivery of an amount of cash equal to the\ndifference between the value of the index at\nthe close of the last trading day of the\ncontract and the price at which\nthe index contract originally was written.\nAlthough the value of an index might be a\nfunction of the value of certain specified\nsecurities, physical delivery of these\nsecurities is not always made. A public market\nexists in futures contracts\ncovering a number of indexes, as well as\n\n4\n\nfinancial instruments, including, without\nlimitation: U.S. Treasury bonds; U.S. Treasury\nnotes; GNMA Certificates; three-month U.S.\nTreasury bills; 90-day\ncommercial paper; bank certificates of\ndeposit; Eurodollar certificates of deposit;\nthe Australian Dollar; the Canadian Dollar;\nthe British Pound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss\nFranc; the Mexican Peso; and certain\nmultinational currencies, such as the\nEuro. It is expected that other futures\ncontracts will be developed and traded in the\nfuture. Futures contracts are standardized as\nto maturity date and underlying instrument and\nare traded on futures exchanges.\n\nThe Fund may purchase and write (sell) call\nand put options on futures. Options on futures\ngive the holder the right, in return for the\npremium paid, to\nassume a long position (call) or short\nposition (put) in a futures contract at a\nspecified exercise price upon expiration of,\nor at any time during the period of, the\noption. Upon exercise of a call option, the\nholder acquires a long position in the\nfutures contract and the writer is assigned\nthe opposite short position. In the case of a\nput option, the opposite is true. The Fund is\nrequired to make a good faith margin deposit\nin cash or U.S. government securities (or\nother eligible collateral)\nwith a broker or custodian to initiate and\nmaintain open positions in futures contracts.\nA margin deposit is intended to assure\ncompletion of the contract (delivery or\nacceptance of the underlying commodity or\npayment of the cash settlement amount)\nif it is not terminated prior to the specified\ndelivery date. Brokers may establish deposit\nrequirements which are higher than the\nexchange minimums. Futures contracts are\ncustomarily purchased and sold on margin\ndeposits which may range upward from\nless than 5% of the value of the contract\nbeing traded.\n\nAfter a futures contract position is opened,\nthe value of the contract is marked to market\ndaily.\nIf the futures contract price changes to the\nextent that the margin on deposit does not\nsatisfy price changes additional payments will\nbe required. Conversely, change in the\ncontract value may reduce the required margin,\nresulting in a repayment of\nexcess margin to the contract holder.\nVariation margin payments are made to and from\nthe futures broker for as long as the contract\nremains open. In such case, the Fund would\nexpect to earn interest income on its margin\ndeposits. Although some\nfutures contracts call for making or taking\ndelivery of the underlying commodity,\ngenerally these obligations are closed out\nprior to delivery by offsetting purchases or\nsales of matching futures contracts (involving\nthe same exchange, underlying\nsecurity or index and delivery month). If an\noffsetting purchase price is less than the\noriginal sale price, the Fund realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is more, the Fund\nrealizes a capital loss. Conversely, if an\noffsetting sale price is more than\nthe original purchase price, the Fund realizes\na capital gain, or if it is less, the Fund\nrealizes a capital loss. The transaction costs\nalso must be included in these calculations.\n\n. The Fund intends to use commodity interests\nsuch as futures, swaps and options on futures\nin accordance\nwith Rule 4.5 of the CEA. The Fund may use\nexchange-traded futures and options on\nfutures, together with positions in cash and\nmoney market instruments, to simulate full\ninvestment in its underlying Index. Exchange-\ntraded futures and options on\nfutures contracts may not be currently\navailable for the Index. Under such\ncircumstances, the Adviser may seek to utilize\nother instruments that it believes to be\ncorrelated to the Index components or a subset\nof the components. An exclusion from\nthe definition of the term \u0093commodity pool\noperator\u0094 has been claimed with respect to\neach series of the Trust in accordance with\nRule 4.5 such that registration or regulation\nas a commodity pool operator under the CEA is\nnot necessary.\n\n. The Fund reserves the right to engage in\ntransactions involving futures, options\nthereon and swaps\nto the extent allowed by the CFTC regulations\nin effect from time to time and in accordance\nwith the Fund\u0092s policies. The Fund would take\nsteps to prevent its futures positions from\n\u0093leveraging\u0094 its securities holdings. When it\nhas a\nlong futures position, it will maintain with\nits custodian bank assets substantially\nidentical to those underlying the contract or\ncash and equivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under\nthe contract (less the value of any margin\ndeposits in connection with the position).\nWhen it has a short futures position, it will\nmaintain with its custodian bank assets\nsubstantially identical to those underlying\nthe contract or cash and\nequivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position).\n\n. The Fund may purchase and sell put and call\noptions. Such options may relate to particular\nsecurities and may or may not be listed on a\nnational securities exchange and issued by the\nOptions Clearing Corporation. Options trading\nis a highly specialized activity that entails\ngreater than ordinary investment risk. Options\non particular securities may be more volatile\nthan the\nunderlying securities, and therefore, on a\npercentage basis, an investment in options may\nbe subject to greater fluctuation than an\ninvestment in the underlying securities\nthemselves.\n\nThe Fund may engage in short sales \u0093against\nthe box.\u0094 In a short sale against the box, the\nFund\nagrees to sell at a future date a security\nthat it either contemporaneously owns or has\nthe right to acquire at no extra cost. If the\nprice of the security has declined at the time\nthe Fund is required to deliver the security,\nthe Fund will benefit\nfrom the difference in the price. If the price\nof the security has increased, the Fund will\nbe required to pay the difference.\n\n5\n\n. The Fund may enter into swap transactions,\nincluding interest rate, swap, credit\ndefault swap, NDF, and total return swap\ntransactions. Swap transactions are contracts\nbetween parties in which one party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the other party\nbased on the change in market value or level\nof a specified rate, index or\nasset. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake payments to the first party based on the\nreturn of a different specified rate, index or\nasset. Swap transactions will usually be done\non a net basis, i.e., where the two parties\nmake net\npayments with the Fund receiving or paying, as\nthe case may be, only the net amount of the\ntwo payments. The net amount of the excess, if\nany, of the Fund\u0092s obligations over its\nentitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis\nand an amount of cash or equivalents having an\naggregate value at least equal to the accrued\nexcess is maintained by the Fund. Swaps may be\nused in conjunction with other instruments to\noffset interest rate, currency or other\nunderlying risks. For\nexample, interest rate swaps may be offset\nwith \u0093caps,\u0094 \u0093floors\u0094 or \u0093collars\u0094. A \u0093cap\u0094 is\nessentially a call option which places a limit\non the amount of floating rate interest that\nmust be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u0093floor\u0094 is essentially a\nput option which places a limit on the minimum\namount that would be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u0093collar\u0094 is essentially a\ncombination of a long cap and a short floor\nwhere\nthe limits are set at different levels.\n\nThe use of swap transactions by the Fund\nentails certain risks, which may be different\nfrom, or possibly greater\nthan, the risks associated with investing\ndirectly in the securities and other\ninvestments that are the referenced asset for\nthe swap agreement. Swaps are highly\nspecialized instruments that require\ninvestment techniques, risk analyses, and tax\nplanning different from those associated with\nstocks, bonds, and other traditional\ninvestments. The use of a swap requires an\nunderstanding not only of the referenced\nasset, reference rate, or index, but also of\nthe swap itself, without the benefit\nof observing the performance of the swap under\nall the possible market conditions. Because\nsome swap transactions have a leverage\ncomponent, adverse changes in the value or\nlevel of the underlying asset, reference rate,\nor index can result in a loss\nsubstantially greater than the amount invested\nin the swap itself. Certain swaps have the\npotential for unlimited loss, regardless of\nthe size of the initial investment.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the \u0093Dodd-Frank Act\u0094) that was\nsigned into law on July 21, 2010 created a new\nstatutory framework that comprehensively\nregulated the over-the-counter (\u0093OTC\u0094)\nderivatives markets for the first time. Key\nDodd-Frank Act provisions relating\nto OTC derivatives require rulemaking by the\nSEC and the CFTC, not all of which has been\nproposed or finalized as at the date of this\nSAI. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTC\nderivatives markets were traditionally traded\non a bilateral basis (so-called \u0093bilateral OTC\ntransactions\u0094). Under the Dodd-Frank Act,\ncertain OTC derivatives transactions are now\nrequired to be centrally cleared and traded on\nexchanges or electronic trading platforms\ncalled swap execution facilities (\u0093SEFs\u0094).\n\nBilateral OTC transactions differ from\nexchange-traded or cleared derivatives\ntransactions in\nseveral respects. Bilateral OTC transactions\nare transacted directly with dealers and not\nwith a clearing corporation. Without the\navailability of a clearing corporation,\nbilateral OTC transaction pricing is normally\ndone by reference to information\nfrom market makers and/or available index\ndata, which information is carefully monitored\nby the Adviser and verified in appropriate\ncases. As bilateral OTC transactions are\nentered into directly with a dealer, there is\na risk of nonperformance by\nthe dealer as a result of its insolvency or\notherwise. Under recently-adopted regulations\nby the CFTC and federal banking regulators\n(\u0093Margin Rules\u0094), the Fund is required to post\ncollateral (known as variation margin) to\ncover the mark-to-market exposure in respect\nof its uncleared swaps. The Margin Rules also\nmandate that collateral in the form of initial\nmargin be posted to cover potential future\nexposure attributable to uncleared swap\ntransactions. In the event the Fund is\nrequired to post collateral in the form of\ninitial margin or variation margin in respect\nof its uncleared swap transactions, all such\ncollateral will be posted with a\nthird party custodian pursuant to a triparty\ncustody agreement between the Fund, its dealer\ncounterparty and an unaffiliated custodian.\n\nThe requirement\nto execute certain OTC derivatives contracts\non SEFs may offer certain advantages over\ntraditional bilateral OTC trading, such as\nease of execution, price transparency,\nincreased liquidity and/or favorable pricing.\nHowever, SEF trading may make it\nmore difficult and costly for the Fund to\nenter into highly tailored or customized\ntransactions and may result in additional\ncosts and risks. Market participants such as\nthe Fund that execute derivatives contracts\nthrough a SEF, whether directly or\nthrough a broker intermediary, are required to\nsubmit to the jurisdiction of the SEF and\ncomply with SEF and CFTC rules and regulations\nwhich impose, among other things disclosure\nand recordkeeping obligations. In addition,\nthe Fund will generally\nincur SEF or broker intermediary fees when it\ntrades on a SEF. The Fund may also be required\nto indemnify the SEF or broker intermediary\nfor any losses or costs that may result from\nthe Fund\u0092s transactions on the SEF.\n\n. The Fund may enter into total return swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. Total\nreturn swaps are transactions in which one\nparty agrees to make periodic payments based\non the change in market value of the\nunderlying assets, which may include a\nspecified security, basket of securities or\nsecurity indexes during the specified period,\nin return for periodic payments based\non a fixed or variable interest rate of the\ntotal return from other underlying assets.\nTotal return swaps may be used to obtain\nexposure to a security or market without\nowning or taking physical custody of such\nsecurity or market, including in cases\nin which there may be disadvantages associated\nwith direct ownership of a particular\nsecurity. In a typical total return equity\nswap, payments made by the Fund or the\ncounterparty are based on the total return of\na particular reference asset or\nassets (such as an equity security, a\ncombination of such securities, or an index).\nThat is, one party agrees to pay another party\nthe return on a stock, basket of stocks, or\nstock index in return for a specified interest\nrate. By entering into an\nequity index swap, for example, the index\nreceiver can gain\n\n6\n\nexposure to stocks making up the index of\nsecurities without actually purchasing those\nstocks. Total return swaps involve not only\nthe risk associated with the investment in the\nunderlying\nsecurities, but also the risk of the\ncounterparty not fulfilling its obligations\nunder the agreement.\n\n. The Fund may enter\ninto credit default swap transactions for\ninvestment purposes. A credit default swap\ntransaction may have as reference obligations\none or more securities that are not currently\nheld by the Fund. The Fund may be either the\nprotection buyer or\nprotection seller in the transaction. Credit\ndefault swaps may also be structured based on\nthe debt of a basket of issuers, rather than a\nsingle issuer, and may be customized with\nrespect to the default event that triggers\npurchase or other factors.\nAs a protection seller, the Fund would\ngenerally receive an upfront payment or a\nfixed rate of income throughout the term of\nthe swap, which typically is between six\nmonths and three years, provided that there is\nno credit event. If a credit event\noccurs, generally the protection seller must\npay the protection buyer the full face amount\nof the reference obligations that may have\nlittle or no value. The notional value of the\ncredit default swap will be used to segregate\nliquid assets for\nselling protection on credit default swaps. If\nthe Fund were a protection buyer and no credit\nevent occurred during the term of the swap,\nthe Fund would recover nothing if the swap\nwere held through its termination date.\nHowever, if a credit event\noccurred, the protection buyer may elect to\nreceive the full notional value of the swap in\nexchange for an equal face amount of the\nreference obligation that may have little or\nno value. Where the Fund is the protection\nbuyer, credit default swaps\ninvolve the risk that the seller may fail to\nsatisfy its payment obligations to the Fund in\nthe event of a default. The purchase of credit\ndefault swaps involves costs, which will\nreduce the Fund\u0092s return. When the Fund buys\ncredit default\nswaps it will segregate an amount at least\nequal to the amount of any accrued premium\npayment obligations including amounts for\nearly terminations.\n\n. The Fund may enter into currency swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. Currency\nswaps are similar to interest rate swaps,\nexcept\nthat they involve multiple currencies. The\nFund may enter into a currency swap when it\nhas exposure to one currency and desires\nexposure to a different currency. Typically,\nthe interest rates that determine the currency\nswap payments are fixed,\nalthough occasionally one or both parties may\npay a floating rate of interest. Unlike an\ninterest rate swap, however, the principal\namounts are exchanged at the beginning of the\ncontract and returned at the end of the\ncontract. In addition to paying\nand receiving amounts at the beginning and end\nof the transaction, both sides will have to\npay in full on a periodic basis based upon the\ncurrency they have borrowed. Change in foreign\nexchange rates and changes in interest rates,\nas described\nabove, may negatively affect currency swaps.\n\n. The Fund may enter into an interest rate\nswap in an effort to protect against\ndeclines in the value of fixed income\nsecurities held by the Fund. In such an\ninstance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed\nrate (multiplied by a notional amount) while a\ncounterparty agrees to pay a floating rate\n(multiplied by the same notional\namount). If interest rates rise, resulting in\na diminution in the value of the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio, the Fund would receive payments\nunder the swap that would offset, in whole or\nin part, such diminution in value.\n\n. An option on a swap agreement, or a\n\u0093swaption,\u0094 is a contract that gives a\ncounterparty the right (but not the\nobligation)\nto enter into a new swap agreement or to\nshorten, extend, cancel or otherwise modify an\nexisting swap agreement, at some designated\nfuture time on specified terms. In return, the\npurchaser pays a \u0093premium\u0094 to the seller of\nthe contract.\nThe seller of the contract receives the\npremium and bears the risk of unfavorable\nchanges on the underlying swap. The Fund may\nwrite (sell) and purchase put and call\nswaptions. The Fund may also enter into\nswaptions on either an asset-based or\nliability-based basis, depending on whether\nthe Fund is hedging its assets or its\nliabilities. The Fund may write (sell) and\npurchase put and call swaptions to the same\nextent it may make use of standard options on\nsecurities or other instruments.\nThe Fund may enter into these transactions\nprimarily to preserve a return or spread on a\nparticular investment or portion of its\nholdings, as a duration management technique,\nto protect against an increase in the price of\nsecurities the Fund\nanticipates purchasing at a later date, or for\nany other purposes, such as for speculation to\nincrease returns. Swaptions are generally\nsubject to the same risks involved in the\nFund\u0092s use of options.\n\nDepending on the terms of the particular\noption agreement, the Fund will generally\nincur a greater degree of risk when it writes\na swaption than it will incur\nwhen it purchases a swaption. When the Fund\npurchases a swaption, it risks losing only the\namount of the premium it has paid should it\ndecide to let the option expire unexercised.\nHowever, when the Fund writes a swaption, upon\nexercise of the option\nthe Fund will become obligated according to\nthe terms of the underlying agreement.\n\nCertain additional risk factors related to\nderivatives are discussed\nbelow:\n\n. Under recently adopted rules by the CFTC,\ntransactions in some types of interest rate\nswaps and index credit default\nswaps on North American and European indices\nare required to be cleared. In addition, the\nCFTC may promulgate additional regulations\nthat require clearing of other classes of\nswaps. In a cleared derivatives transaction\n(which includes commodities\nfutures and cleared swaps transactions), the\nFund\u0092s counterparty is a clearing house (such\nas CME, ICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet),\nrather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund\nis not a member of a clearing house and only\nmembers of a\nclearing house can participate directly in the\nclearing house, the Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers, who are futures commission merchants\nthat are members of the clearing houses and\nwho have the appropriate\nregulatory approvals to engage in cleared swap\n\n7\n\ntransactions. The Fund makes and receives\npayments owed under cleared derivatives\ntransactions (including margin payments)\nthrough its accounts at clearing members.\nClearing members guarantee\nperformance of their clients\u0092 obligations to\nthe clearing house. In contrast to bilateral\nOTC transactions, clearing members generally\ncan require termination of existing cleared\nderivatives transactions at any time and\nincreases in margin\nabove the margin that it required at the\nbeginning of a transaction. Clearing houses\nalso have broad rights to increase margin\nrequirements for existing transactions and to\nterminate transactions. Any such increase or\ntermination could interfere\nwith the ability of the Fund to pursue its\ninvestment strategy. Also, the Fund is subject\nto execution risk if it enters into a\nderivatives transaction that is required to be\ncleared (or that the Advisor expects to be\ncleared), and no clearing\nmember is willing or able to clear the\ntransaction on the Fund\u0092s behalf. While the\ndocumentation in place between the Fund and\nits clearing members generally provides that\nthe clearing members will accept for clearing\nall transactions submitted\nfor clearing that are within credit limits\nspecified by the clearing members in advance,\nthe Fund could be subject to this execution\nrisk if the Fund submits for clearing\ntransactions that exceed such credit limits,\nif the clearing house does not\naccept the transactions for clearing, or if\nthe clearing members do not comply with their\nagreement to clear such transactions. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of any\nincrease in the value of the transaction after\nthe time of the transaction. In addition, new\nregulations could, among other things,\nrestrict the Fund\u0092s ability to engage in, or\nincrease the cost to the Fund of, derivatives\ntransactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund or increasing\nmargin or capital requirements. If the Fund is\nnot able to enter into a particular\nderivatives transaction, the Fund\u0092s investment\nperformance and risk\nprofile could be adversely affected as a\nresult.\n\n. Counterparty risk with respect to OTC\nderivatives may be affected by new\nregulations promulgated by the CFTC and SEC\naffecting the derivatives market. As described\nunder \u0093Derivatives Risk\u0094 above, some\nderivatives transactions are required to be\ncleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives\ntransaction is\nsubject to the credit risk of the clearing\nhouse and the clearing member through which it\nholds its cleared derivatives position, rather\nthan the credit risk of its original\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction.\nClearing members are required\nto segregate all funds received from customers\nwith respect to cleared derivatives\ntransactions from the clearing member\u0092s\nproprietary assets. However, all funds and\nother property received by a clearing broker\nfrom its customers are generally\nheld by the clearing broker on a commingled\nbasis in an omnibus account, which may also\ninvest those funds in certain instruments\npermitted under the applicable regulations.\nAlso, the clearing member transfers to the\nclearing house the amount of\nmargin required by the clearing house for\ncleared derivatives transactions, which\namounts are generally held in the relevant\nomnibus account at the clearing house for all\ncustomers of the clearing member.\n\nFor commodities futures positions, the\nclearing house may use all of the collateral\nheld in the clearing member\u0092s omnibus account\nto meet a loss in that\naccount, without regard to which customer in\nfact supplied that collateral. Accordingly, in\naddition to bearing the credit risk of its\nclearing member, each customer to a futures\ntransaction also bears \u0093fellow customer\u0094 risk\nfrom other\ncustomers of the clearing member. However,\nwith respect to cleared swaps positions,\nrecent regulations promulgated by the CFTC\nrequire that the clearing member notify the\nclearing house of the amount of initial margin\nprovided by the clearing member\nto the clearing house that is attributable to\neach customer. Because margin in respect of\ncleared swaps must be earmarked for specific\nclearing member customers, the clearing house\nmay not use the collateral of one customer to\ncover the obligations\nof another customer. However, if the clearing\nmember does not provide accurate reporting,\nthe Fund is subject to the risk that a\nclearing house will use the Fund\u0092s assets held\nin an omnibus account at the clearing house to\nsatisfy payment\nobligations of a defaulting customer of the\nclearing member to the clearing house. In\naddition, clearing members may generally\nchoose to provide to the clearing house the\nnet amount of variation margin required for\ncleared swaps for all of its\ncustomers in the aggregate, rather than the\ngross amount for each customer.\n\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nThe Fund may take advantage of opportunities\nin the area of options and futures contracts,\noptions on futures contracts, warrants, swaps\nand any other\ninvestments which are not presently\ncontemplated for use by the Fund or which are\nnot currently available but which may be\ndeveloped, to the extent such opportunities\nare both consistent with the Fund\u0092s investment\nobjective and legally\npermissible for the Fund. Before entering into\nsuch transactions or making any such\ninvestment, the Fund will provide appropriate\ndisclosure.\n\nILLIQUID\nSECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in illiquid securities.\nThe Fund may not acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund\nwould have invested more than 15% of its net\nassets in illiquid securities. An illiquid\nsecurity means any security that the Fund\nreasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed\nof in current market conditions in seven\ncalendar days or less without\nthe sale or disposition significantly changing\nthe market value of the investment. If\nilliquid securities exceed 15% of the Fund\u0092s\nnet assets, certain remedial actions will be\ntaken as required by Rule\n22e-4 under the 1940 Act and the Fund\u0092s\npolicies and procedures.\n\n8\n\nINVESTMENT COMPANIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in the securities of other\ninvestment companies, including affiliated\nfunds and money market funds, subject to\napplicable limitations under\nSection 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to\nSection 12(d)(1), the Fund may invest in the\nsecurities of another investment company (the\n\u0093acquired company\u0094) provided that the Fund,\nimmediately after such purchase or\nacquisition,\ndoes not own in the aggregate: (i) more than\n3% of the total outstanding voting stock of\nthe acquired company; (ii) securities issued\nby the acquired company having an aggregate\nvalue in excess of 5% of the value of the\ntotal assets of the\nFund; or (iii) securities issued by the\nacquired company and all other investment\ncompanies (other than Treasury stock of the\nFund) having an aggregate value in excess of\n10% of the value of the total assets of the\nFund. To the extent allowed\nby law, regulation, the Fund\u0092s investment\nrestrictions and the Trust\u0092s exemptive relief,\nthe Fund may invest its assets in securities\nof investment companies that are affiliated\nfunds and/or money market funds in excess of\nthe limits\ndiscussed above.\n\nIf the Fund invests in and, thus, is a\nshareholder of, another investment company,\nthe Fund\u0092s shareholders will indirectly bear\nthe\nFund\u0092s proportionate share of the fees and\nexpenses paid by such other investment\ncompany, including advisory fees, in addition\nto both the management fees payable directly\nby the Fund to the Fund\u0092s own investment\nadviser and the other\nexpenses that the Fund bears directly in\nconnection with the Fund\u0092s own operations.\n\nLENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may lend portfolio securities to\ncertain creditworthy borrowers in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. markets in an amount not\nto exceed 40% of the value of its net assets.\nThe borrowers provide collateral that is\nmarked to market daily in an amount at least\nequal to the current market value of the\nsecurities loaned. The Fund may terminate a\nloan at any time and obtain\nthe securities loaned. The Fund receives the\nvalue of any interest or cash or non-cash\ndistributions paid on the loaned securities.\nThe Fund cannot vote proxies for securities on\nloan, but may recall loans to\nvote proxies if a material issue affecting the\nFund\u0092s economic interest in the investment is\nto be voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities, and\nmay involve expenses to the Fund.\nDistributions received on loaned securities in\nlieu of dividend payments (i.e., substitute\npayments) would not be considered qualified\ndividend income.\n\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower will be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. The Fund is\ncompensated by the difference between the\namount earned on the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral and the fee paid to the borrower.\nIn the case of collateral other than cash, the\nFund is compensated by a fee paid by the\nborrower equal to a percentage\nof the market value of the loaned securities.\nAny cash collateral may be reinvested in\ncertain high quality short-term instruments\neither directly on behalf of the Fund or\nthrough one or more joint accounts or funds,\nwhich may include those managed\nby the Adviser. The Fund could lose money due\nto a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. Certain\nnon-cash collateral or investments\nmade with cash collateral may have a greater\nrisk of loss than other non-cash collateral or\ninvestments.\n\nThe Fund\nmay pay a portion of the interest or fees\nearned from securities lending to a borrower\nas described above, and to one or more\nsecurities lending agents approved by the\nBoard of Trustees of the Trust (the \u0093Board\u0094)\nwho administer the lending\nprogram for the Fund in accordance with\nguidelines approved by the Board. In such\ncapacity, the lending agent provides the\nfollowing services to the Fund in connection\nwith the Fund\u0092s securities lending activities:\n(i) locating borrowers\namong an approved list of prospective\nborrowers; (ii) causing the delivery of loaned\nsecurities from the Fund to borrowers; (iii)\nmonitoring the value of loaned securities, the\nvalue of collateral received, and other\nlending parameters;\n(iv) seeking additional collateral, as\nnecessary, from borrowers; (v) receiving and\nholding collateral from borrowers, and\nfacilitating the investment and reinvestment\nof all or substantially all cash collateral in\nan investment vehicle\ndesignated by the Fund; (vi) returning\ncollateral to borrowers; (vii) facilitating\nsubstitute dividend, interest, and other\ndistribution payments to the Fund from\nborrowers; (viii) negotiating the terms of\neach loan of securities,\nincluding but not limited to the amount of any\nloan premium, and monitoring the terms of\nsecurities loan agreements with prospective\nborrowers for consistency with the\nrequirements of the Fund\u0092s Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement;\n(ix) selecting securities, including amounts\n(percentages), to be loaned; (x) recordkeeping\nand accounting servicing; and (xi) arranging\nfor return of loaned securities to the Fund in\naccordance with the terms of the Securities\nLending Authorization Agreement. State Street\nBank and Trust Company (\u0093State Street\u0094), an\naffiliate of the Trust, has been approved by\nthe Board to serve as securities lending agent\nfor the Fund and the Trust has entered into an\nagreement\nwith State Street for such services. Among\nother matters, the Trust has agreed to\nindemnify State Street for certain\nliabilities. State Street has received an\norder of exemption from the SEC under Sections\n17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the 1940 Act to\nserve as the lending agent for affiliated\ninvestment companies such as the Trust and to\ninvest the cash collateral received from loan\ntransactions to be invested in an affiliated\ncash collateral fund.\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and\naccounting process especially so in certain\ninternational markets such as Taiwan), \u0093gap\u0094\nrisk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the\nreturn on cash collateral reinvestments and\nthe fees the Fund has agreed to pay a\nborrower), risk of\nloss of collateral, credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risk. If a securities\nlending counterparty were to default, the Fund\nwould be subject to\n\n9\n\nthe risk of a possible delay in receiving\ncollateral or in recovering the loaned\nsecurities, or to a possible loss of rights in\nthe collateral. In the event a borrower does\nnot return the\nFund\u0092s securities as agreed, the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the loaned security\nat the time the collateral is liquidated, plus\nthe transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nAlthough State Street has agreed to provide\nthe Fund with indemnification in the event of\na borrower default, the Fund is still exposed\nto the risk of losses in the event a borrower\ndoes not return the\nFund\u0092s securities as agreed. For example,\ndelays in recovery of lent securities may\ncause the Fund to lose the opportunity to sell\nthe securities at a desirable price.\n\nLEVERAGING\n\nWhile the Fund does not anticipate doing so,\nthe\nFund may borrow money in an amount greater\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund\u0092s total\nassets. However, under normal circumstances,\nthe Fund will not borrow money from a bank in\nan amount greater than 10% of the value of the\nFund\u0092s total\nassets. Borrowing for investment purposes is\none form of leverage. Leveraging investments,\nby purchasing securities with borrowed money,\nis a speculative technique that increases\ninvestment risk, but also increases investment\nopportunity. Because substantially all of the\nFund\u0092s assets will fluctuate in value, whereas\nthe interest obligations on borrowings may be\nfixed, the NAV of the Fund will increase more\nwhen the Fund\u0092s portfolio assets increase in\nvalue and decrease more when the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio assets decrease in value than would\notherwise be the case. Moreover, interest\ncosts on borrowings may fluctuate with\nchanging market rates of interest and may\npartially offset or exceed the\nreturns on the borrowed funds.\n\nOTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser),\ncash and cash\nequivalents, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by the\nAdviser); (ii) obligations issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities (including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit (\u0093CDs\u0094),\nbankers\u0092 acceptances,\nfixed time deposits and other obligations of\nU.S. and foreign banks (including foreign\nbranches) and similar institutions; (iv)\ncommercial paper rated at the date of purchase\n\u0093Prime-1\u0094 by\nMoody\u0092s Investors Service (\u0093Moody\u0092s\u0094) or \u0093A-1\u0094\nby Standard & Poor\u0092s (\u0093S&P\u0094), or if unrated,\nof comparable quality as determined by the\nAdviser; (v) non-convertible corporate debt\nsecurities (e.g., bonds and debentures) with\nremaining maturities at the date of purchase\nof not more than 397 days and that present\nminimal credit risk; and\n(vi) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated\nobligations of foreign banks (including U.S.\nbranches) that, in the opinion of the Adviser,\nare of comparable quality to obligations of\nU.S. banks which may be purchased by the Fund.\nAny of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or a\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates.\nBankers\u0092 acceptances are time drafts drawn on\ncommercial banks by borrowers, usually in\nconnection with international transactions.\nMoney market instruments also include shares\nof money market funds. The SEC and other\ngovernment agencies\ncontinue to review the regulation of money\nmarket funds. The SEC has adopted changes to\nthe rules that govern money market funds, and\ncompliance with many of these amendments was\nrequired in October 2016. Legislative\ndevelopments may also affect\nmoney market funds. These changes and\ndevelopments may affect the investment\nstrategies, performance, yield, operating\nexpenses and continued viability of a money\nmarket fund.\n\nPREFERRED SECURITIES\n\nPreferred securities pay fixed or\nadjustable rate dividends to investors, and\nhave \u0093preference\u0094 over common stock in the\npayment of dividends and the liquidation of a\ncompany\u0092s assets. This means that a company\nmust pay dividends on preferred stock before\npaying any\ndividends on its common stock. In order to be\npayable, distributions on preferred securities\nmust be declared by the issuer\u0092s board of\ndirectors. Income payments on typical\npreferred securities currently outstanding are\ncumulative, causing\ndividends and distributions to accrue even if\nnot declared by the board of directors or\notherwise made payable. There is no assurance\nthat dividends or distributions on the\npreferred securities in which the Fund invests\nwill be declared or otherwise\nmade payable.\n\nThe market value of preferred securities may\nbe affected by favorable and unfavorable\nchanges impacting companies in the utilities\nand\nfinancial services sectors, which are\nprominent issuers of preferred securities, and\nby actual and anticipated changes in tax laws.\n\nBecause the claim on\nan issuer\u0092s earnings represented by preferred\nsecurities may become onerous when interest\nrates fall below the rate payable on such\nsecurities, the issuer may redeem the\nsecurities. Thus, in declining interest rate\nenvironments in particular,\nthe Fund\u0092s holdings of higher rate-paying\nfixed rate preferred securities may be reduced\nand the Fund would be unable to acquire\nsecurities paying comparable rates with the\nredemption proceeds.\n\n10\n\nPRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND RESTRICTED SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in securities that are\npurchased in private placements and,\naccordingly, are subject to restrictions on\nresale as a matter of contract or\nunder federal securities laws. While such\nprivate placements may offer attractive\nopportunities for investment not otherwise\navailable on the open market, the securities\nso purchased are often \u0093restricted\nsecurities,\u0094 i.e., securities\nwhich cannot be sold to the public without\nregistration under the Securities Act or the\navailability of an exemption from registration\n(such as Rules 144 or 144A), or which are not\nreadily marketable because they are subject to\nother legal or\ncontractual delays in or restrictions on\nresale. Generally speaking, restricted\nsecurities may be sold only to qualified\ninstitutional buyers, or in a privately\nnegotiated transaction to a limited number of\npurchasers, or in limited quantities after\nthey have been held for a specified period of\ntime and other conditions are met pursuant to\nan exemption from registration, or in a public\noffering for which a registration statement is\nin effect under the Securities Act.\n\nBecause there may be relatively few potential\npurchasers for such investments, especially\nunder adverse market or economic conditions or\nin the event of\nadverse changes in the financial condition of\nthe issuer, the Fund could find it more\ndifficult to sell such securities when the\nAdviser believes it advisable to do so or may\nbe able to sell such securities only at prices\nlower than if such\nsecurities were more widely held. Market\nquotations for such securities are generally\nless readily available than for publicly\ntraded securities. The absence of a trading\nmarket can make it difficult to ascertain a\nmarket value for such securities\nfor purposes of computing the Fund\u0092s net asset\nvalue, and the judgment of the Adviser may at\ntimes play a greater role in valuing these\nsecurities than in the case of publicly traded\nsecurities. Disposing of such securities,\nwhich may be\nilliquid investments, can involve time-\nconsuming negotiation and legal expenses, and\nit may be difficult or impossible for the Fund\nto sell them promptly at an acceptable price.\nThe Fund may have to bear the extra expense of\nregistering such\nsecurities for resale and the risk of\nsubstantial delay in effecting such\nregistration.\n\nThe Fund may be deemed to be an \u0093underwriter\u0094\nfor\npurposes of the Securities Act when selling\nrestricted securities to the public, and in\nsuch event the Fund may be liable to\npurchasers of such securities if the\nregistration statement prepared by the issuer,\nor the prospectus forming a part of it,\nis materially inaccurate or misleading.\n\nREAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u0093REITs\u0094)\n\nREITs pool investors\u0092 funds for investment\nprimarily in income producing real estate or\nreal estate loans or interests. A REIT is not\ntaxed on income\ndistributed to shareholders if it complies\nwith several requirements relating to its\norganization, ownership, assets, and income\nand a requirement that it distribute to its\nshareholders at least 90% of its taxable\nincome (other than net capital\ngains) for each taxable year. REITs can\ngenerally be classified as Equity REITs,\nMortgage REITs and Hybrid REITs. Equity REITs,\nwhich invest the majority of their assets\ndirectly in real property, derive their income\nprimarily from rents. Equity\nREITs can also realize capital gains by\nselling properties that have appreciated in\nvalue. Mortgage REITs, which invest the\nmajority of their assets in real estate\nmortgages, derive their income primarily from\ninterest payments. Hybrid REITs combine\nthe characteristics of both Equity REITs and\nMortgage REITs. The Fund will not invest in\nreal estate directly, but only in securities\nissued by real estate companies. However, the\nFund may be subject to risks similar to those\nassociated with the\ndirect ownership of real estate (in addition\nto securities markets risks) to the extent\nthey invest in the securities of companies in\nthe real estate industry. These include\ndeclines in the value of real estate, risks\nrelated to general and local\neconomic conditions, dependency on management\nskill, heavy cash flow dependency, possible\nlack of availability of mortgage funds,\noverbuilding, extended vacancies of\nproperties, increased competition, increases\nin property taxes and operating\nexpenses, changes in zoning laws, losses due\nto costs resulting from the clean-up of\nenvironmental problems, liability to third\nparties for damages resulting from\nenvironmental problems, casualty or\ncondemnation losses, limitations on rents,\nchanges in neighborhood values, the appeal of\nproperties to tenants and changes in interest\nrates. Investments in REITs may subject Fund\nshareholders to duplicate management and\nadministrative fees.\n\nIn addition to these risks, Equity REITs may\nbe affected by changes in the value of the\nunderlying property owned by the trusts, while\nMortgage REITs may be\naffected by the quality of any credit\nextended. Further, Equity and Mortgage REITs\nare dependent upon management skills and may\nnot be diversified. Equity and Mortgage REITs\nare also subject to heavy cash flow\ndependency, defaults by borrowers and\nself-liquidation. In addition, Equity and\nMortgage REITs could possibly fail to qualify\nfor the beneficial tax treatment available to\nREITs under the Internal Revenue Code, or to\nmaintain their exemptions from registration\nunder the 1940 Act. The\nabove factors may also adversely affect a\nborrower\u0092s or a lessee\u0092s ability to meet its\nobligations to the REIT. In the event of a\ndefault by a borrower or lessee, the REIT may\nexperience delays in enforcing its rights as a\nmortgagee or\nlessor and may incur substantial costs\nassociated with protecting investments.\n\nREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in repurchase agreements\nwith commercial banks, brokers or dealers to\ngenerate income from its excess cash balances\nand to invest\nsecurities lending cash collateral. A\nrepurchase agreement is an agreement under\nwhich the Fund acquires a financial instrument\n(e.g., a security issued by the U.S.\ngovernment or an agency thereof, a banker\u0092s\nacceptance or a certificate\nof\n\n11\n\ndeposit) from a seller, subject to resale to\nthe seller at an agreed upon price and date\n(normally, the next Business Day \u0096 as defined\nbelow). A repurchase agreement may be\nconsidered a loan\ncollateralized by securities. The resale price\nreflects an agreed upon interest rate\neffective for the period the instrument is\nheld by the Fund and is unrelated to the\ninterest rate on the underlying instrument.\n\nIn these repurchase agreement transactions,\nthe securities acquired by the Fund (including\naccrued interest earned thereon) must have a\ntotal value in excess\nof the value of the repurchase agreement and\nare held by the Custodian until repurchased.\nNo more than an aggregate of 15% of the Fund\u0092s\nnet assets will be invested in illiquid\nsecurities, including repurchase agreements\nhaving maturities\nlonger than seven days and securities subject\nto legal or contractual restrictions on\nresale, or for which there are no readily\navailable market quotations.\n\nThe use of repurchase agreements involves\ncertain risks. For example, if the other party\nto the agreement defaults on its obligation to\nrepurchase the\nunderlying security at a time when the value\nof the security has declined, the Fund may\nincur a loss upon disposition of the security.\nIf the other party to the agreement becomes\ninsolvent and subject to liquidation or\nreorganization under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or other laws, a court may\ndetermine that the underlying security is\ncollateral for a loan by the Fund not within\nthe control of the Fund and, therefore, the\nFund may not be able to substantiate its\ninterest in the underlying\nsecurity and may be deemed an unsecured\ncreditor of the other party to the agreement.\n\nREVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements, which involve the sale of\nsecurities with an agreement to repurchase the\nsecurities at an agreed-upon\nprice, date and interest payment and have the\ncharacteristics of borrowing. The securities\npurchased with the funds obtained from the\nagreement and securities collateralizing the\nagreement will have maturity dates no later\nthan the repayment date.\nGenerally the effect of such transactions is\nthat the Fund can recover all or most of the\ncash invested in the portfolio securities\ninvolved during the term of the reverse\nrepurchase agreement, while in many cases the\nFund is able to keep some of\nthe interest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are only\nadvantageous if the Fund has an opportunity to\nearn a greater rate of interest on the cash\nderived from these transactions than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same\namount of cash. Opportunities to realize\nearnings from the use of the proceeds equal to\nor greater than the interest required to be\npaid may not always be available and the Fund\nintends to use the reverse repurchase\ntechnique only when the Adviser\nbelieves it will be advantageous to the Fund.\nThe use of reverse repurchase agreements may\nexaggerate any interim increase or decrease in\nthe value of the Fund\u0092s assets. The Fund\u0092s\nexposure to reverse repurchase agreements will\nbe covered\nby securities having a value equal to or\ngreater than such commitments. Under the 1940\nAct, reverse repurchase agreements are\nconsidered borrowings. Although there is no\npercentage limit on Fund assets that can be\nused in connection with reverse\nrepurchase agreements, the Fund does not\nexpect to engage, under normal circumstances,\nin reverse repurchase agreements with respect\nto more than 10% of its total assets.\n\nU.S. REGISTERED SECURITIES OF FOREIGN ISSUERS\n\nInvesting in U.S.\nregistered, dollar-denominated, securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers involves some risks\nand considerations not typically associated\nwith investing in U.S. companies. These\ninclude differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards,\nthe possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations,\npolitical instability which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in foreign countries, and\npotential restrictions of the flow of\ninternational capital. Foreign companies may\nbe subject to less governmental regulation\nthan U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual\nforeign economies may differ favorably or\nunfavorably from the U.S. economy in such\nrespects as growth of gross domestic product,\nrate of inflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and balance of\npayment positions.\n\nThe\nFund\u0092s investment in common stock of foreign\ncorporations may also be in the form of\nAmerican Depositary Receipts (\u0093ADRs\u0094), Global\nDepositary Receipts (\u0093GDRs\u0094) and European\nDepositary Receipts (\u0093EDRs\u0094)\n(collectively \u0093Depositary Receipts\u0094).\nDepositary Receipts are receipts, typically\nissued by a bank or trust company, which\nevidence ownership of underlying securities\nissued by a foreign corporation. For ADRs, the\ndepository is typically a\nU.S. financial institution and the underlying\nsecurities are issued by a foreign issuer. For\nother Depositary Receipts, the depository may\nbe a foreign or a U.S. entity, and the\nunderlying securities may have a foreign or a\nU.S. issuer. Depositary\nReceipts will not necessarily be denominated\nin the same currency as their underlying\nsecurities. Generally, ADRs, in registered\nform, are designed for use in the U.S.\nsecurities markets, and EDRs, in bearer form,\nare designated for use in European\nsecurities markets. GDRs are tradable both in\nthe United States and in Europe and are\ndesigned for use throughout the world. The\nFund may invest in unsponsored Depositary\nReceipts. The issuers of unsponsored\nDepositary Receipts are not obligated to\ndisclose material information in the United\nStates, and, therefore, there may be less\ninformation available regarding such issuers\nand there may not be a correlation between\nsuch information and the market value of the\nDepositary Receipts.\n\n12\n\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS\n\nA discussion of the risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. The discussion below supplements,\nand should be read in\nconjunction with, the Prospectus.\n\nGENERAL\n\nInvestment in\nthe Fund should be made with an understanding\nthat the value of the Fund\u0092s portfolio\nsecurities may fluctuate in accordance with\nchanges in the financial condition of the\nissuers of the portfolio securities, the value\nof securities generally\nand other factors.\n\nAn investment in the Fund should also be made\nwith an understanding of the risks inherent in\nan investment in securities, including\nthe risk that the financial condition of\nissuers may become impaired or that the\ngeneral condition of the securities markets\nmay deteriorate (either of which may cause a\ndecrease in the value of the portfolio\nsecurities and thus in the value of\nShares). Securities are susceptible to general\nmarket fluctuations and to volatile increases\nand decreases in value as market confidence in\nand perceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable\nfactors including expectations regarding\ngovernment, economic, monetary and fiscal\npolicies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic and banking\ncrises. Securities of issuers traded\non exchanges may be suspended on certain\nexchanges by the issuers themselves, by an\nexchange or by government authorities. The\nlikelihood of such suspensions may be higher\nfor securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than\nin countries with more developed markets.\nTrading suspensions may be applied from time\nto time to the securities of individual\nissuers for reasons specific to that issuer,\nor may be applied broadly by exchanges or\ngovernmental authorities in\nresponse to market events. Suspensions may\nlast for significant periods of time, during\nwhich trading in the securities and\ninstruments that reference the securities,\nsuch as participatory notes (or\n\u0093P-notes\u0094) or other derivative instruments,\nmay be halted.\n\nHolders of common stock incur more risk than\nholders of preferred stocks and debt\nobligations because common stockholders, as\nowners of the issuer, have generally inferior\nrights to receive payments from the issuer in\ncomparison with the rights of creditors of, or\nholders of debt obligations\nor preferred stocks issued by, the issuer.\nFurther, unlike debt securities which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (whose value, however,\nwill be subject to market fluctuations prior\nthereto), or preferred stocks which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stock have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity. Common stock values are subject to\nmarket fluctuations as long as the\ncommon stock remains outstanding.\n\nThe principal trading market for some of the\nsecurities in the Index may be in the over-\nthe-counter market. The existence of a liquid\ntrading market for certain securities may\ndepend on whether dealers will make a market\nin such securities. There can be no assurance\nthat a market will be\nmade or maintained or that any such market\nwill be or remain liquid. The price at which\nsecurities may be sold and the value of the\nFund\u0092s Shares will be adversely affected if\ntrading markets for the Fund\u0092s portfolio\nsecurities are limited\nor absent or if bid/ask spreads are wide.\n\nBREXIT RISK\n\nIn\nJune 2016, citizens of the United Kingdom\nvoted in a referendum to leave the European\nUnion (\u0093EU\u0094) (known as \u0093Brexit\u0094), creating\neconomic and political uncertainty in its\nwake. In March 2017, the United Kingdom\nformally notified\nthe European Council of the United Kingdom\u0092s\nintention to withdraw from the EU pursuant to\nArticle 50 of the Treaty on European Union.\nThis formal notification began a multi-year\nperiod of negotiations regarding the terms of\nthe United\nKingdom\u0092s exit from the EU, which formally\noccurred on January 31, 2020. A transition\nperiod will take place following the United\nKingdom\u0092s exit where the United Kingdom will\nremain subject to EU rules but will have no\nrole in the EU law-making process. During this\ntransition period, United Kingdom and EU\nrepresentatives will be negotiating the\nprecise terms of their future relationship.\nThe full scope and nature of the consequences\nof the exit\nare not at this time known and are unlikely to\nbe known for a significant period of time. It\nis also unknown whether the United Kingdom\u0092s\nexit will increase the likelihood of other\ncountries also departing the EU. Any exits\nfrom the EU, or the\npossibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for\nsuch economies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund\u0092s\ninvestments.\n\n13\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK\n\nAn investment in the Fund may be subject to a\nnumber of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest. For example, the Adviser or its\naffiliates may provide\nservices to the Fund, such as securities\nlending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting\nservices, transfer agency and shareholder\nservicing, securities brokerage services, and\nother services for which the Fund would\ncompensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates.\nThe Fund may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise\naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no\nassurance that the rates at which the Fund\npays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates, will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser makes\navailable to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nmay have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of the\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest.\n\nCONTINUOUS OFFERING\n\nThe method by which Creation Units of\nShares are created and traded may raise\ncertain issues under applicable securities\nlaws. Because new Creation Units of Shares are\nissued and sold by the Trust on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u0093distribution,\u0094 as such\nterm is used in the\nSecurities Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nwhich could render them\nstatutory underwriters and subject them to the\nprospectus delivery and liability provisions\nof the Securities Act.\n\nFor example, a broker-dealer firm or\nits client may be deemed a statutory\nunderwriter if it takes Creation Units after\nplacing an order with the Distributor, breaks\nthem down into constituent Shares, and sells\nsuch Shares directly to customers, or if it\nchooses to couple the creation\nof a supply of new Shares with an active\nselling effort involving solicitation of\nsecondary market demand for Shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the Securities Act must take\ninto account all the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case, and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an\nunderwriter.\n\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u0093underwriters\u0094 but are\neffecting transactions in Shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nShares, are generally required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\nSecurities Act is not available in respect of\nsuch transactions as a\nresult of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms\nthat incur a prospectus-delivery obligation\nwith respect to Shares of the Fund are\nreminded that under Securities Act Rule 153, a\nprospectus-delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the\nSecurities Act owed to an exchange member in\nconnection with a sale on the Exchange is\nsatisfied by the fact that the Fund\u0092s\nProspectus is available at the Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism\nprovided in Rule 153 is only\navailable with respect to transactions on an\nexchange.\n\nSSGA or its affiliates (the \u0093Selling\nShareholder\u0094) may purchase Creation Units\nthrough a\nbroker-dealer to \u0093seed\u0094 (in whole or in part)\nthe Fund as it is launched, or may purchase\nshares from broker-dealers or other investors\nthat have previously provided \u0093seed\u0094 for the\nFund when it was launched or otherwise in\nsecondary market transactions, and because the\nSelling Shareholder may be deemed an affiliate\nof the Fund, the Shares are being registered\nto permit the resale of these shares from time\nto time after purchase. The Fund will not\nreceive any of the\nproceeds from the resale by the Selling\nShareholders of these Shares.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder intends to sell all or\na portion of the Shares owned by it\nand offered hereby from time to time directly\nor through one or more broker-dealers, and may\nalso hedge such positions. The Shares may be\nsold on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the Shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, in\nthe over-the-counter market or in transactions\nother than on these exchanges or systems at\nfixed prices, at prevailing market prices at\nthe time of the sale, at varying\nprices determined at the time of sale, or at\nnegotiated prices. These sales may be effected\nin transactions, which may involve cross or\nblock transactions.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder may also loan or\npledge Shares to broker-dealers that in turn\nmay sell such Shares, to the extent permitted\nby applicable law. The\nSelling Shareholder may also enter into\noptions or other transactions with broker-\ndealers or other financial institutions or the\ncreation of one or more derivative securities\nwhich require the delivery to such broker-\ndealer or other financial\ninstitution of Shares, which Shares such\nbroker-dealer or other financial institution\nmay resell.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer\nor agents\nparticipating in the distribution of Shares\nmay be deemed to be \u0093underwriters\u0094 within the\nmeaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act\nin connection with such sales. In such event,\nany commissions paid to any such broker-dealer\nor\nagent and any profit on the resale of the\nShares purchased by them may be deemed to be\nunderwriting commissions or discounts under\nthe Securities Act. The Selling Shareholder\nwho may be deemed an \u0093underwriter\u0094 within the\nmeaning of\nSection 2(11) of the Securities Act will be\nsubject to the applicable prospectus delivery\nrequirements of the Securities Act.\n\n14\n\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK\n\nCounterparty risk with respect to derivatives\nhas been and may continue to be affected by\nnew rules and regulations affecting the\nderivatives market. Some\nderivatives transactions are required to be\ncentrally cleared, and a party to a cleared\nderivatives transaction is subject to the\ncredit risk of the clearing house and the\nclearing member through which it holds its\ncleared position, rather than the\ncredit risk of its original counterparty to\nthe derivatives transaction. Credit risk of\nmarket participants with respect to\nderivatives that are centrally cleared is\nconcentrated in a few clearing houses, and it\nis not clear how an insolvency\nproceeding of a clearing house would be\nconducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by the\nFund, and what impact an insolvency of a\nclearing house would have on the financial\nsystem more generally.\n\nFUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS\n\nThere can be no assurance that\na liquid secondary market will exist for any\nparticular futures contract or option at any\nspecific time. Thus, it may not be possible to\nclose a futures or options position. In the\nevent of adverse price movements, the Fund\nwould continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if the Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do\nso. In addition, the Fund may be required to\nmake delivery of the instruments underlying\nfutures contracts it has sold.\n\nThe Fund will minimize the risk\nthat it will be unable to close out a futures\nor options contract by only entering into\nfutures and options for which there appears to\nbe a liquid secondary market.\n\nThe risk of loss in trading futures contracts\nor uncovered call options in some strategies\n(e.g., selling uncovered index futures\ncontracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts, when\navailable, in this manner. The risk of a\nfutures position may still be large as\ntraditionally measured due to the low margin\ndeposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, may utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit its risk exposure to that\nwhich is comparable to what it would have\nincurred through direct investment in\nsecurities.\n\nUtilization of\nfutures transactions by the Fund involves the\nrisk of imperfect or even negative correlation\nto its benchmark Index if the index underlying\nthe futures contracts differs from the\nbenchmark Index or if the futures contracts do\nnot track the benchmark\nIndex as expected. There is also the risk of\nloss by the Fund of margin deposits in the\nevent of bankruptcy of a broker with whom the\nFund has an open position in the futures\ncontract or option.\n\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract prices during a single trading day.\nThe daily limit\nestablishes the maximum amount that the price\nof a futures contract may vary either up or\ndown from the previous day\u0092s settlement price\nat the end of a trading session. Once the\ndaily limit has been reached in a particular\ntype of contract, no\ntrades may be made on that day at a price\nbeyond that limit. The daily limit governs\nonly price movement during a particular\ntrading day and therefore does not limit\npotential losses, because the limit may\nprevent the liquidation of unfavorable\npositions. Futures contract prices have\noccasionally moved to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting some futures traders to\nsubstantial losses.\n\nLIBOR RISK\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the\nUnited Kingdom\u0092s Financial Conduct Authority,\nwhich regulates LIBOR, announced that it\nintends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021.\nThe replacement or abandonment of, or\nmodification to, LIBOR could have adverse\nimpacts on newly issued\nfinancial instruments and existing financial\ninstruments which reference LIBOR. While some\ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate setting methodology, not\nall instruments may\nhave such provisions and there are significant\nuncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any\nsuch alternative methodologies. Abandonment of\nor modifications to LIBOR could lead to\nsignificant short-term and long-term\nuncertainty and market\ninstability. Instruments in which the Fund\ninvests may pay interest at floating or\nadjusting rates based on LIBOR or may be\nsubject to interest caps or floors. There\nremains uncertainty regarding the future\nutilization of LIBOR and the nature of any\nreplacement rate. The unavailability or\nreplacement of LIBOR may affect the value,\nliquidity or return on certain Fund\ninvestments and may result in costs incurred\nin connection with closing out positions and\nentering into new trades. Any pricing\nadjustments to the Fund\u0092s investments\nresulting from a substitute reference rate may\nalso adversely affect the Fund\u0092s performance\nand/or NAV. Such successor or substitute\nreference rate and any adjustments selected\nmay negatively impact\nthe Fund\u0092s investments, performance or\nfinancial condition, and may expose the Fund\nto additional tax, accounting and regulatory\nrisks, Additionally, if LIBOR ceases to exist,\nthe Fund may need to renegotiate the credit\nagreements extending\nbeyond 2021 with the Fund\u0092s obligors that\nutilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the\ninterest rate and certain of the Fund\u0092s\nexisting credit facilities to replace LIBOR\nwith the new standard that is established. Any\npricing adjustments\nto the Fund\u0092s investments resulting from a\nsubstitute reference rate may also adversely\naffect the Fund\u0092s performance and/or NAV. Such\nsuccessor or substitute reference rate and any\nadjustments selected may negatively impact the\nFund\u0092s investments, performance or financial\ncondition, and may expose the Fund to\nadditional tax, accounting and regulatory\nrisks.\n\n15\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with\nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a\nsteering committee\ncomprised of large U.S. financial\ninstitutions, is considering replacing U.S.\ndollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by\nshort-term repurchase agreements, backed by\nTreasury securities. Abandonment of or\nmodifications to LIBOR could have adverse\nimpacts on newly issued financial instruments\nand existing financial instruments which\nreference LIBOR. While some instruments may\ncontemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no\nlonger available by providing for an\nalternative rate setting methodology,\nnot all instruments may have such provisions\nand there are significant uncertainty\nregarding the effectiveness of any such\nalternative methodologies.\n\nIn\n2012, regulators in the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom alleged that some of the member\nbanks surveyed by the British Bankers\nAssociation engaged in manipulative acts in\nconnection with the calculation of LIBOR.\nSeveral financial institutions\nhave reached settlements with the CFTC, the\nU.S. Department of Justice Fraud Section and\nthe United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority\nin connection with investigations by such\nauthorities into submissions made by such\nfinancial institutions to the\nbodies that set LIBOR and other interbank\noffered rates. Additional investigations\nremain ongoing with respect to other major\nbanks. Despite increased regulation and other\ncorrective actions since that time, concerns\nhave arisen regarding\nLIBOR\u0092s viability as a benchmark, due to\ndecreased confidence of the market in LIBOR\nand lead market participants looking for\nalternative, non-LIBOR based types of\nfinancing, such as fixed rate loans or\nbonds or floating rate loans based on non-\nLIBOR indices.\n\nMARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING FROM COVID-19\n\nAn outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by\na novel coronavirus first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has\nspread globally in a short period of time. In\nan organized attempt to contain and mitigate\nthe effects of the spread of the coronavirus\nknown as COVID-19, governments and businesses\nworld-wide have taken\naggressive measures, including closing\nborders, restricting international and\ndomestic travel, and the imposition of\nprolonged quarantines of large populations.\nCOVID-19 has resulted in the disruption of and\ndelays in the delivery of healthcare services\nand processes, the cancellation of organized\nevents and educational institutions, the\ndisruption of production and supply chains, a\ndecline in consumer demand for certain goods\nand services, and general\nconcern and uncertainty, all of which have\ncontributed to increased volatility in global\nmarkets. The effects of COVID-19 will likely\naffect certain sectors and industries more\ndramatically than others, which\nmay adversely affect the value of the Fund\u0092s\ninvestments in those sectors or industries.\nCOVID-19, and other epidemics and pandemics\nthat may arise in the future, could adversely\naffect the economies of\nmany nations, the global economy, individual\ncompanies and capital markets in ways that\ncannot be foreseen at the present time. In\naddition, the impact of infectious diseases in\ndeveloping or emerging market countries may be\ngreater due to limited\nhealth care resources. Political, economic and\nsocial stresses caused by COVID-19 also may\nexacerbate other pre-existing political,\nsocial and economic risks in certain\ncountries. The duration of COVID-19 and its\neffects cannot be determined at this time, but\nthe effects could be present for an extended\nperiod of time.\n\nRISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nSwap agreements are subject to the\nrisk that the swap counterparty will default\non its obligations. If such a default occurs,\nthe Fund will have contractual remedies\npursuant to the agreements related to the\ntransaction, but such remedies may be subject\nto bankruptcy and insolvency\nlaws which could affect the Fund\u0092s rights as a\ncreditor.\n\nThe use of interest-rate and index swaps is a\nhighly specialized activity that involves\ninvestment techniques and risks different from\nthose associated with ordinary portfolio\nsecurity transactions. The use of a swap\nrequires an understanding not only of the\nreferenced asset, reference rate or index but\nalso of the swap itself, without\nthe benefit of observing the performance of\nthe swap under all possible market conditions.\nThese transactions generally do not involve\nthe delivery of securities or other underlying\nassets or principal.\n\nThe absence of a regulated execution facility\nor contract market and lack of liquidity for\nswap transactions has led, in some instances,\nto difficulties in\ntrading and valuation, especially in the event\nof market disruptions. Under recently adopted\nrules and regulations, transactions in some\ntypes of swaps are required to be centrally\ncleared. In a cleared derivatives transaction,\nthe Fund\u0092s\ncounterparty to the transaction is a central\nderivatives clearing organization, or clearing\nhouse, rather than a bank or broker. Because\nthe Fund is not a member of a clearing house,\nand only members of a clearing house can\nparticipate directly in\nthe clearing house, the Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers. In cleared derivatives transactions,\nthe Fund will make payments (including margin\npayments) to and receive payments from a\nclearing house through its\naccounts at clearing members. Clearing members\nguarantee performance of their clients\u0092\nobligations to the clearing house. Centrally\ncleared derivative arrangements may be less\nfavorable to the Fund than bilateral\n(non-cleared) arrangements. For example, the\nFund may be required to provide greater\namounts of margin for cleared derivatives\ntransactions than for bilateral derivatives\ntransactions. Also, in contrast to\nbilateral derivatives transactions, in some\ncases following a period of notice to the\nFund, a clearing member generally can require\ntermination of existing cleared derivatives\ntransactions at any time or an increase in\nmargin requirements above the\nmargin that the clearing member required at\nthe beginning of a transaction. Clearing\nhouses also have broad rights to increase\nmargin requirements for existing transactions\nor to terminate transactions at any time. The\nFund is subject to risk if it\nenters into a derivatives transaction that is\nrequired to be cleared (or\n\n16\n\nwhich SSGA FM expects to be cleared), and no\nclearing member is willing or able to clear\nthe transaction on the Fund\u0092s behalf. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and\nthe Fund could lose some or all of the benefit\nof the transaction, including loss of an\nincrease in the value of the transaction and\nloss of hedging protection. In addition, the\ndocumentation governing the relationship\nbetween the Fund and clearing\nmembers is drafted by the clearing members and\ngenerally is less favorable to the Fund than\ntypical bilateral derivatives documentation.\n\nThese clearing\nrules and other new rules and regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict the Fund\u0092s\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to\nthe Fund of, derivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available\nto the Fund, increasing margin or capital\nrequirements, or otherwise limiting liquidity\nor increasing transaction costs. These\nregulations are new and evolving, so their\npotential impact on the Fund and the financial\nsystem are not yet known.\n\nBecause they are two party contracts that may\nbe subject to contractual restrictions on\ntransferability and termination and because\nthey may have terms of\ngreater than seven days, swap agreements may\nbe considered to be illiquid and subject to\nthe Fund\u0092s limitation on investments in\nilliquid securities. To the extent that a swap\nis not liquid, it may not be possible to\ninitiate a transaction or\nliquidate a position at an advantageous time\nor price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Like most other investments, swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nmarket value of the instrument will change in\na way detrimental to the\nFund\u0092s interest.\n\nIf the Fund uses a swap as a hedge against, or\nas a substitute for, a portfolio investment,\nthe Fund will be exposed to the risk\nthat the swap will have or will develop\nimperfect or no correlation with the portfolio\ninvestment. This could cause substantial\nlosses for the Fund. While hedging strategies\ninvolving swap instruments can reduce the risk\nof loss, they can also\nreduce the opportunity for gain or even result\nin losses by offsetting favorable price\nmovements in other Fund investments. Many\nswaps are complex and often valued\nsubjectively.\n\nTAX RISKS\n\nAs with any investment, you should consider\nhow your\ninvestment in Shares of the Fund will be\ntaxed. The tax information in the Prospectus\nand this SAI is provided as general\ninformation. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in Shares of the Fund.\n\nUnless your investment in Shares is made\nthrough tax-advantaged retirement account,\nsuch as an individual\nretirement account, you need to be aware of\nthe possible tax consequences when the Fund\nmakes distributions or you sell Shares.\n\nINVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe Trust has adopted the following investment\nrestrictions as fundamental policies with\nrespect to the Fund. These\nrestrictions cannot be changed without the\napproval of the holders of a majority of the\nFund\u0092s outstanding voting securities. For\npurposes of the 1940 Act, a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund\nmeans the vote, at an annual\nor a special meeting of the security holders\nof the Trust, of the lesser of (1) 67% or more\nof the voting securities of the Fund present\nat such meeting, if the holders of more than\n50% of the outstanding voting securities of\nthe Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (2) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. Except with the approval of a\nmajority of the outstanding voting securities,\nthe Fund may not:\n\n1. Concentrate its investments in securities\nof issuers in the same industry, except as may\nbe necessary to approximate the composition of\nthe Fund\u0092s\nunderlying Index;\n\n2. Make loans to another person except as\npermitted by the 1940 Act or other\ngoverning statute, by the Rules thereunder, or\nby the SEC or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund;\n\n3. Issue senior securities or borrow\nmoney except as permitted by the 1940 Act or\nother governing statute, by the Rules\nthereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory\nagency with authority over the Fund;\n\n4. Invest directly in real estate unless the\nreal estate is acquired as a result of\nownership of securities or other instruments.\nThis restriction shall not\npreclude the Fund from investing in companies\nthat deal in real estate or in instruments\nthat are backed or secured by real estate;\n\n5. Act as an\nunderwriter of another issuer\u0092s securities,\nexcept to the extent the Fund may be deemed to\nbe an underwriter within the meaning of the\nSecurities Act in connection with the Fund\u0092s\npurchase and sale of portfolio securities; or\n\n6. Invest in commodities except as permitted\nby the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other\nregulatory agency\nwith authority over the Fund.\n\n17\n\nIn addition to the investment restrictions\nadopted as fundamental policies as set forth\nabove, the Fund observes\nthe following restrictions, which may be\nchanged by the Board without a shareholder\nvote. The Fund will not:\n\n1. Invest in the securities of a company for\nthe purpose of exercising management or\ncontrol, provided that the Trust may vote the\ninvestment securities owned by the Fund in\naccordance with its views; and\n\n2. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its total assets in securities\nthat comprise the Index. Securities that have\neconomic characteristics\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index are included within this\n80% investment policy;\n\nThe\nFund defines the foregoing terms in accordance\nwith the definition of such terms per the\nIndex. If a percentage limitation is adhered\nto at the time of investment or contract, a\nlater increase or decrease in percentage\nresulting from any change in\nvalue or total or net assets will not result\nin a violation of such restriction, except\nthat the percentage limitations with respect\nto the borrowing of money will be observed\ncontinuously. With respect to the limitation\non borrowing, in the event\nthat a subsequent change in net assets or\nother circumstances cause the Fund to exceed\nits limitation, the Fund will take steps to\nbring the aggregate amount of borrowing back\nwithin the limitations within three days\nthereafter (not including\nSundays and holidays).\n\nThe 1940 Act currently permits the Fund to\nloan up to 33 1/3% of its total assets. With\nrespect to borrowing, the 1940 Act\npresently allows the Fund to: (1) borrow from\nany bank (including pledging, mortgaging or\nhypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33\n/% of its total assets, (2) borrow money for\ntemporary purposes in an amount not exceeding\n5% of the value of the Fund\u0092s total\nassets at the time of the loan, and (3) enter\ninto reverse repurchase agreements. However,\nunder normal circumstances any borrowings by\nthe Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund\u0092s\ntotal assets. The 1940 Act generally prohibits\nfunds from\nissuing senior securities, although it does\nnot treat certain transactions as senior\nsecurities, such as certain borrowings, short\nsales, reverse repurchase agreements, firm\n                                              \n     The SEC Staff considers concentration    \n     to involve more than 25% of a fund\u0092s      \n     assets to be invested in an              \n     industry or group of industries.         \n     commitment agreements and standby        \n     commitments, with appropriate            \n     earmarking or segregation of assets to   \n     cover such obligation. With respect to   \n     investments in commodities, the 1940     \n     Act presently permits the Fund to        \n     invest in commodities in accordance      \n     with investment policies contained in    \n     its prospectus and SAI. Any such         \n  1  investment shall also comply with the    \n     CEA and the rules and regulations        \n     thereunder. The 1940 Act does not        \n     directly restrict an investment          \n     company\u0092s ability to invest in real       \n     estate, but does require that every      \n     investment company have the fundamental  \n     investment policy governing such         \n     investments. The Fund will not purchase  \n     or sell real estate, except that the     \n     Fund may invest in                       \n     companies that deal in real estate       \n     (including REITs) or in instruments      \n     that are backed or secured by real       \n     estate.                                  \n                                              \nEXCHANGE LISTING AND TRADING\n\nA discussion of exchange listing and trading\nmatters associated with an investment in the\nFund is contained in the\nProspectus under \u0093PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION\u0094 and \u0093ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION.\u0094 The discussion below\nsupplements, and should be read in conjunction\nwith, such sections of the Prospectus.\n\nThe Shares of the Fund are approved for\nlisting and trading on the Exchange, subject\nto notice of issuance. The Shares trade on the\nExchange at prices that\nmay differ to some degree from their net asset\nvalue. There can be no assurance that the\nrequirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of Shares of the Fund\nwill continue to be met.\n\nThe Exchange may consider the suspension of\ntrading in, and may initiate delisting\nproceedings of, the Shares of the Fund under\nany of the following\ncircumstances: (i) if any of the continued\nlisting requirements set forth in the Exchange\nrules are not continuously maintained; (ii) if\nthe Exchange files separate proposals under\nSection 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934,\nas amended, and any of the statements or\nrepresentations regarding (a) the description\nof the Index, portfolio, or reference asset;\n(b) limitations on the Index or the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio holdings or reference assets; or (c)\nthe\napplicability of the Exchange listing rules\nspecified in such proposals are not\ncontinuously maintained; (iii) if following\nthe initial 12-month period beginning at the\ncommencement of trading of the\nFund, there are fewer than 50 record or\nbeneficial owners of the Shares of the Fund;\n(iv) if the value of the Fund\u0092s underlying\nindex or portfolio of securities on which the\nFund is based is no longer calculated or\navailable; or\n(v) such other event shall occur or condition\nshall exist that, in the opinion of the\nExchange, makes further dealings on the\nExchange inadvisable. If the Intraday\nIndicative Value of the Fund is not being\ndisseminated as required by Exchange\nrules, the Exchange may halt trading during\nthe day in which such interruption occurs. If\nthe interruption persists past the trading day\nin which it occurred, the Exchange will halt\ntrading in the Shares. The Exchange will\nremove the Shares from\nlisting and trading upon termination of the\nFund. The Trust reserves the right to adjust\nthe Fund Share price of the Fund in the future\nto maintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits\nor reverse stock splits, which would have no\neffect on the net assets of the Fund.\n\n18\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nShare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading\nranges for investors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund.\n\nAs in the case of other publicly traded\nsecurities, brokers\u0092 commissions on\ntransactions will be based on negotiated\ncommission rates at customary\nlevels.\n\nThe base and trading currencies of the Fund is\nthe U.S. dollar. The base currency is the\ncurrency in which the Fund\u0092s net asset value\nper\nShare is calculated and the trading currency\nis the currency in which Shares of the Fund\nare listed and traded on the Exchange.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST\n\nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled\n\u0093MANAGEMENT.\u0094\n\nBoard Responsibilities. The management and\naffairs of the Trust and its series, including\nthe Fund described in this SAI, are\noverseen by the Trustees. The Board has\napproved contracts, as described in this SAI,\nunder which certain companies provide\nessential management services to the Trust.\n\nLike most mutual funds, the day-to-day\nbusiness of the Trust, including the\nmanagement of risk, is performed by third\nparty service providers, such as the Adviser,\nDistributor, Administrator and Sub-\nAdministrator. The Trustees are responsible\nfor overseeing the Trust\u0092s service\nproviders and, thus, have oversight\nresponsibility with respect to risk management\nperformed by those service providers. Risk\nmanagement seeks to identify and address\nrisks, i.e., events or circumstances that\ncould have material adverse effects on\nthe business, operations, shareholder\nservices, investment performance or reputation\nof the Fund. The Fund and its service\nproviders employ a variety of processes,\nprocedures and controls to identify various of\nthose possible events or\ncircumstances, to lessen the probability of\ntheir occurrence and/or to mitigate the\neffects of such events or circumstances if\nthey do occur. Each service provider is\nresponsible for one or more discrete aspects\nof the Trust\u0092s business (e.g.,\nthe Adviser is responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund\u0092s portfolio\ninvestments) and, consequently, for managing\nthe risks associated with that\nbusiness. The Board has emphasized to the\nFund\u0092s service providers the importance of\nmaintaining vigorous risk management.\n\nThe Trustees\u0092 role\nin risk oversight begins before the inception\nof the Fund, at which time the Fund\u0092s Adviser\npresents the Board with information concerning\nthe investment objectives, strategies and\nrisks of the Fund, as well as proposed\ninvestment limitations\nfor the Fund. Additionally, the Fund\u0092s Adviser\nprovides the Board with an overview of, among\nother things, their investment philosophies,\nbrokerage practices and compliance\ninfrastructures. Thereafter, the Board\ncontinues its oversight function\nas various personnel, including the Trust\u0092s\nChief Compliance Officer, as well as personnel\nof the Adviser and other service providers,\nsuch as the Fund\u0092s independent accountants,\nmake periodic reports to the Audit Committee\nor to the Board\nwith respect to various aspects of risk\nmanagement. The Board and the Audit Committee\noversee efforts by management and service\nproviders to manage risks to which the Fund\nmay be exposed.\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the\nnature, extent and quality of the services\nprovided to the Fund by the Adviser and\nreceives information about\nthose services at its regular meetings. In\naddition, on an annual basis, in connection\nwith its consideration of whether to renew the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with the\nAdviser, the Board meets with the Adviser to\nreview such services. Among\nother things, the Board regularly considers\nthe Adviser\u0092s adherence to the Fund\u0092s\ninvestment restrictions and compliance with\nvarious Fund policies and procedures and with\napplicable securities regulations. The Board\nalso reviews\ninformation about the Fund\u0092s investments.\n\nThe Trust\u0092s Chief Compliance Officer reports\nregularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance\nissues. At least annually, the Trust\u0092s Chief\nCompliance Officer provides the Board with a\nreport reviewing the adequacy and\neffectiveness of the Trust\u0092s policies and\nprocedures and those of its service providers,\nincluding the Adviser. The\nreport addresses the operation of the policies\nand procedures of the Trust and each service\nprovider since the date of the last report;\nany material changes to the policies and\nprocedures since the date of the last report;\nany recommendations for\nmaterial changes to the policies and\nprocedures; and any material compliance\nmatters since the date of the last report.\n\nThe Board receives reports from\nthe Fund\u0092s service providers regarding\noperational risks and risks related to the\nvaluation and liquidity of portfolio\nsecurities. Regular reports are made to the\nBoard concerning investments for which market\nquotations are not readily\navailable. Annually, the independent\nregistered public accounting firm reviews with\nthe Audit Committee its audit of the Fund\u0092s\nfinancial statements, focusing on major areas\nof risk encountered by the Fund and noting any\nsignificant\ndeficiencies or material weaknesses in the\nFund\u0092s internal controls. Additionally, in\nconnection with its oversight function, the\nBoard oversees Fund\n\n19\n\nmanagement\u0092s implementation of disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, which are designed to\nensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports\nwith the SEC\nare recorded, processed, summarized, and\nreported within the required time periods. The\nBoard also oversees the Trust\u0092s internal\ncontrols over financial reporting, which\ncomprise policies and procedures designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of the Trust\u0092s\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of the\nTrust\u0092s financial statements.\n\nFrom their review of\nthese reports and discussions with the\nAdviser, the Chief Compliance Officer, the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand other service providers, the Board and the\nAudit Committee learn in detail about the\nmaterial risks of the Fund,\nthereby facilitating a dialogue about how\nmanagement and service providers identify and\nmitigate those risks.\n\nThe Board recognizes that not all risks\nthat may affect the Fund can be identified\nand/or quantified, that it may not be\npractical or cost-effective to eliminate or\nmitigate certain risks, that it may be\nnecessary to bear certain risks (such as\ninvestment-related risks) to achieve the\nFund\u0092s goals, and that the processes,\nprocedures and controls employed to address\ncertain risks may be limited in their\neffectiveness. Moreover, reports received by\nthe Trustees as to risk management matters are\ntypically summaries of the\nrelevant information. Most of the Fund\u0092s\ninvestment management and business affairs are\ncarried out by or through the Fund\u0092s Adviser\nand other service providers, each of which has\nan independent interest in risk management but\nwhose\npolicies and the methods by which one or more\nrisk management functions are carried out may\ndiffer from the Fund\u0092s and each other\u0092s in the\nsetting of priorities, the resources available\nor the effectiveness of relevant controls. As\na\nresult of the foregoing and other factors, the\nBoard\u0092s ability to monitor and manage risk, as\na practical matter, is subject to limitations.\n\nTrustees and Officers. There are seven members\nof the Board of Trustees, six of whom are not\ninterested persons of the Trust, as that term\nis defined\nin the 1940 Act (\u0093Independent Trustees\u0094).\nFrank Nesvet, an Independent Trustee, serves\nas Chairman of the Board. The Board has\ndetermined its leadership structure is\nappropriate given the specific characteristics\nand circumstances of the\nTrust. The Board made this determination in\nconsideration of, among other things, the fact\nthat the Independent Trustees constitute a\nsuper-majority (greater than 75%) of the\nBoard, the fact that the chairperson of each\nCommittee of the Board is an\nIndependent Trustee, the amount of assets\nunder management in the Trust, and the number\nof funds (and classes of shares) overseen by\nthe Board. The Board also believes that its\nleadership structure facilitates the orderly\nand efficient flow of\ninformation to the Independent Trustees from\nfund management.\n\nThe Board of Trustees has two standing\ncommittees: the Audit Committee and Trustee\nCommittee. The Audit Committee and Trustee\nCommittee are each chaired by an Independent\nTrustee and composed of all of the Independent\nTrustees.\n\nSet\nforth below are the names, year of birth,\nposition with the Trust, length of term of\noffice, and the principal occupations during\nthe last five years and other directorships\nheld of each of the persons currently serving\nas a Trustee or Officer of\nthe Trust.\n\n20\n\nTRUSTEES\n                                              \n                                 NUM\u2026    OT\u2026  \n                  TERM             OF    DI\u2026  \n  N\u2026              OF      PR\u2026    POR\u2026    HE\u2026  \n  A\u2026       PO\u2026    OFF\u2026    OC\u2026      IN    BY   \n  A\u2026       WI\u2026    AND     DU\u2026    FUND    TR\u2026  \n  Y\u2026       FU\u2026    LEN\u2026    PA\u2026    COM\u2026    DU\u2026  \n  OF              OF      5\u00a0     OVE\u2026    THE  \n  B\u2026              TIME    YE\u2026      BY    PA\u2026  \n                  SER\u2026           TRU\u2026    5\u00a0   \n                                         YE\u2026  \n      IN\u2026                                     \n      TR\u2026                                     \n  F\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026       In\u2026    Ter\u2026                        \n  S\u2026       Tr\u2026    Unl\u2026                        \n  T\u2026       Ch\u2026    Ser\u2026                        \n  O\u2026       Tr\u2026    sin\u2026    Re\u2026     125    No\u2026  \n  I\u2026       Co\u2026    Sep\u2026                        \n  S\u2026       Ch\u2026    2000                        \n  B\u2026                                          \n  MA                                          \n  0\u2026                                          \n  1\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  E\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026              Ter\u2026                        \n  S\u2026              Unl\u2026                        \n  T\u2026       In\u2026    Ser\u2026    Re\u2026     125    No\u2026  \n  O\u2026       Tr\u2026    sin\u2026                        \n  I\u2026              Apr\u2026                        \n  S\u2026              2010                        \n  B\u2026                                          \n  MA                                          \n  0\u2026                                          \n  1\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  D.

The Investment\nAdvisory Agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays\u0092 notice by the Adviser and will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined\nin the 1940 Act).\n\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, the\nAdviser, subject to the oversight of the Board\nand in conformity with the stated\ninvestment policies of the Fund, manages the\ninvestment of the Fund\u0092s assets. The Adviser\nis responsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is\nnot liable for certain liabilities, including\ncertain liabilities arising under the federal\nsecurities laws, unless such loss or liability\nresults from willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence\nin the performance of its duties or the\nreckless disregard of its obligations and\nduties.\n\nFor the services provided to the Fund under\nthe Investment\nAdvisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser\nmonthly fees based on a percentage of the\nFund\u0092s average daily net assets as set forth\nin the Fund\u0092s Prospectus. From time to time,\nthe Adviser may waive all or a portion of its\nfee. The\nAdviser pays all expenses of the Fund other\nthan the management fee, brokerage, taxes,\ninterest, fees and expenses of the Independent\nTrustees (including any Trustee\u0092s counsel\nfees), acquired fund fees and expenses,\nlitigation expenses and\nother extraordinary expenses.\n\n29\n\nA summary of the factors considered by the\nBoard of Trustees in connection with the\ninitial approval of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwill be available in the Fund\u0092s first\nshareholder report after the Fund commences\noperations.\n\nThe Fund\nhad not commenced operations as of the date of\nthis SAI and therefore did not pay fees to the\nAdviser for the past three fiscal years.\n\nPORTFOLIO MANAGERS\n\nThe Adviser manages the Fund using a team of\ninvestment professionals. The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management of the Fund are Emiliano\nRabinovich, Karl Schneider and Olga Winner.\nThe following table lists the number and types\nof accounts managed by each of the key\nprofessionals\ninvolved in the day-to-day portfolio\nmanagement for the Fund and assets under\nmanagement in those accounts. The total number\nof accounts and assets have been allocated\nto each respective manager. Therefore, some\naccounts and assets have been counted twice.\n\nOther Accounts Managed as of June 30, 2020:\n                                              \n       R\u2026          O\u2026                      \u2026  \n  \u2026    I\u2026    A\u2026    P\u2026    A\u2026    O\u2026    A\u2026    \u2026  \n  \u2026    C\u2026    M\u2026    I\u2026    M\u2026    A\u2026    M\u2026    \u2026  \n       A\u2026    (\u2026    V\u2026    (\u2026          (\u2026    \u2026  \n                   A\u2026                         \n  \u2026    1\u2026    5\u2026    2\u2026    3\u2026    3\u2026    2\u2026    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    1\u2026    5\u2026    2\u2026    3\u2026    3\u2026    2\u2026    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    1\u2026    5\u2026    2\u2026    3\u2026    3\u2026    2\u2026    \u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  There are no performance-based fees      \n     associated with these accounts.          \n                                              \nThe Fund had not commenced operations prior to\nthe date of this SAI and therefore the\nportfolio managers did not beneficially own\nany Shares.\n\nA portfolio manager that has responsibility\nfor managing more than one account may be\nsubject to potential conflicts of interest\nbecause he or she is\nresponsible for other accounts in addition to\nthe Fund. Those conflicts could include\npreferential treatment of one account over\nothers in terms of: (a) the portfolio\nmanager\u0092s execution of different investment\nstrategies for various\naccounts or (b) the allocation of resources or\nof investment opportunities.\n\nPortfolio managers may manage numerous\naccounts for multiple clients.\nThese accounts may include registered\ninvestment companies, other types of pooled\naccounts (e.g., collective investment funds),\nand separate accounts (i.e., accounts managed\non behalf of individuals or public or private\ninstitutions).\nPortfolio managers make investment decisions\nfor each account based on the investment\nobjectives and policies and other relevant\ninvestment considerations applicable to that\nportfolio.\n\nA potential conflict of interest may arise as\na result of the portfolio managers\u0092\nresponsibility for multiple accounts with\nsimilar investment\nguidelines. Under these circumstances, a\npotential investment may be suitable for more\nthan one of the portfolio managers\u0092 accounts,\nbut the quantity of the investment available\nfor purchase is less than the aggregate amount\nthe accounts would\nideally devote to the opportunity. Similar\nconflicts may arise when multiple accounts\nseek to dispose of the same investment. The\nportfolio managers may also manage accounts\nwhose objectives and policies differ from that\nof the Fund. These\ndifferences may be such that under certain\ncircumstances, trading activity appropriate\nfor one account managed by the portfolio\nmanager may have adverse consequences for\nanother account managed by the portfolio\nmanager. For example, an account may\nsell a significant position in a security,\nwhich could cause the market price of that\nsecurity to decrease, while the Fund\nmaintained its position in that security.\n\nA potential conflict may arise when the\nportfolio managers are responsible for\naccounts that have different advisory fees\u0097the\ndifference in fees could\ncreate an incentive for the portfolio manager\nto favor one account over another, for\nexample, in terms of access to investment\nopportunities. Another potential conflict may\narise when the portfolio manager has an\ninvestment in one or more accounts\nthat participate in transactions with other\naccounts. His or her investment(s) may create\nan incentive for the portfolio manager to\nfavor one account over another. The Adviser\nhas adopted policies and procedures reasonably\ndesigned to address these\npotential material conflicts. For instance,\nportfolio managers are normally responsible\nfor all accounts within a certain investment\ndiscipline, and do not, absent special\ncircumstances, differentiate among the various\naccounts when allocating\nresources. Additionally, the Adviser and its\nadvisory affiliates have processes and\nprocedures for allocating investment\nopportunities among portfolios that are\ndesigned to provide a fair and equitable\nallocation.\n\n30\n\nSSGA\u0092s culture is complemented and reinforced\nby a total rewards strategy that is based on a\npay for\nperformance philosophy which seeks to offer a\ncompetitive pay mix of base salary, benefits,\ncash incentives and deferred compensation.\n\nSalary is based on\na number of factors, including external\nbenchmarking data and market trends, State\nStreet performance, SSGA performance, and\nindividual overall performance. SSGA\u0092s Global\nHuman Resources department regularly\nparticipates in compensation surveys\nin order to provide SSGA with market-based\ncompensation information that helps support\nindividual pay decisions.\n\nAdditionally, subject to State Street\nand SSGA business results, State Street\nallocates an incentive pool to SSGA to reward\nits employees. The size of the incentive pool\nfor most business units is based on the firm\u0092s\noverall profitability and other factors,\nincluding performance\nagainst risk-related goals. For most SSGA\ninvestment teams, SSGA recognizes and rewards\nperformance by linking annual incentive\ndecisions for investment teams to the firm\u0092s\nor business unit\u0092s profitability and business\nunit investment\nperformance over a multi-year period.\n\nIncentive pool funding for most active\ninvestment teams is driven in part by the\npost-tax investment performance of fund(s)\nmanaged by the team versus the return levels\nof the benchmark index(es) of the fund(s) on a\none-, three- and, in some cases,\nfive-year basis. For most active investment\nteams, a material portion of incentive\ncompensation for senior staff is deferred over\na four-year period into the SSGA Long-Term\nIncentive (\u0093SSGA LTI\u0094) program. For these\nteams, The SSGA LTI\nprogram indexes the performance of these\ndeferred awards against the post-tax\ninvestment performance of fund(s) managed by\nthe team. This is intended to align our\ninvestment team\u0092s compensation with\nclient interests, both through annual\nincentive compensation awards and through the\nlong-term value of deferred awards in the SSGA\nLTI program.\n\nFor the\npassive equity investment team, incentive pool\nfunding is driven in part by the post-tax 1\nand 3-year tracking error of the funds managed\nby the team against the\nbenchmark indexes of the funds.\n\nThe discretionary allocation of the incentive\npool to the business units within SSGA is\ninfluenced by market-based\ncompensation data, as well as the overall\nperformance of each business unit. Individual\ncompensation decisions are made by the\nemployee\u0092s manager, in conjunction with the\nsenior management of the employee\u0092s business\nunit. These decisions\nare based on the overall performance of the\nemployee and, as mentioned above, on the\nperformance of the firm and business unit.\nDepending on the job level, a portion of the\nannual incentive may be awarded in deferred\ncompensation, which may include\ncash and/or Deferred Stock Awards (State\nStreet stock), which typically vest over a\nfour-year period. This helps to retain staff\nand further aligns SSGA employees\u0092 interests\nwith SSGA clients\u0092 and shareholders\u0092 long-term\ninterests.\n\nSSGA recognizes and rewards outstanding\nperformance by:\n                                              \n      Promoting employee ownership to         \n      connect employees directly to the       \n      company\u0092s success.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Using rewards to reinforce mission,     \n      vision, values and business strategy.   \n                                              \n                                              \n      Seeking to recognize and preserve the   \n      firm\u0092s unique culture and team           \n      orientation.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Providing all employees the             \n      opportunity to share in the success of  \n      SSGA.                                   \n                                              \nTHE ADMINISTRATOR, SUB-ADMINISTRATOR,\nCUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT\n\nAdministrator. SSGA FM serves as the\nadministrator to each series of the Trust,\npursuant to an Administration Agreement dated\nJune 1, 2015 (the\n\u0093SSGA Administration Agreement\u0094). Pursuant to\nthe SSGA Administration Agreement, SSGA FM is\nobligated to continuously provide business\nmanagement services to the Trust and its\nseries and will generally, subject to the\ngeneral oversight of\nthe Trustees and except as otherwise provided\nin the SSGA Administration Agreement, manage\nall of the business and affairs of the Trust.\n\nSub-Administrator,Custodian and Transfer\nAgent. State Street serves as the sub-\nadministrator to each series of the Trust,\npursuant to a\nSub-Administration Agreement dated June 1,\n2015 (the \u0093Sub-Administration Agreement\u0094).\nUnder the Sub-Administration\nAgreement, State Street is obligated to\nprovide certain sub-administrative services to\nthe Trust and its series. State Street is a\nwholly owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation, a publicly held financial\nholding company, and is affiliated with the\nAdviser. State Street\u0092s mailing address is\nState Street Financial Center, One Lincoln\nStreet, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.\n\nState Street also serves as Custodian for the\nTrust\u0092s series pursuant to a custodian\nagreement (\u0093Custodian Agreement\u0094). As\nCustodian, State\nStreet holds Fund assets, calculates the net\nasset value of the Shares and calculates net\nincome and realized capital gains or losses.\nState Street and the Trust will comply with\nthe self-custodian provisions of Rule\n17f-2 under the 1940 Act.\n\n31\n\nState Street also serves as Transfer Agent for\neach series of the Trust pursuant to a\ntransfer agency agreement\n(\u0093Transfer Agency Agreement\u0094).\n\nCompensation. As compensation for its services\nprovided under the SSGA Administration\nagreement, SSGA FM,\nshall receive fees for the services,\ncalculated based on the average aggregate net\nassets of the Trust and SIS, which are accrued\ndaily and paid monthly out of its management\nfee.\n\nAs compensation for its services under the\nSub-Administration Agreement, Custodian\nAgreement and Transfer Agency\nAgreement, State Street shall receive a fee\nfor the services, calculated based on the\naverage aggregate net assets of the Trust and\nSIS, which are accrued daily and paid monthly\nby the Adviser from its management fee. For\neach series of the\nTrust and SIS, an annual minimum fee applies.\nIn addition, State Street shall receive global\nsafekeeping and transaction fees, which are\ncalculated on a per-country basis,\nin-kind creation (purchase) and redemption\ntransaction fees (as described below) and\nrevenue on certain cash balances. State Street\nmay be reimbursed for its out-of-pocket\nexpenses. The Investment Advisory Agreement\nprovides that the Adviser will pay certain\noperating expenses of the Trust, including the\nfees due to State Street under the Custodian\nAgreement and\nthe Transfer Agency Agreement.\n\nTHE DISTRIBUTOR\n\nState\nStreet Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC\nis the principal underwriter and Distributor\nof Shares. Its principal address is One Iron\nStreet, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. Investor\ninformation can be obtained by calling\n1-866-787-2257. The Distributor has entered\ninto a distribution agreement (\u0093Distribution\nAgreement\u0094) with the Trust pursuant\nto which it distributes Shares of the Fund.\nThe Distribution Agreement will continue for\ntwo years from its effective date and is\nrenewable annually thereafter. Shares will be\ncontinuously offered for sale by the Trust\nthrough the Distributor only\nin Creation Units, as described in the\nProspectus and below under \u0093PURCHASE AND\nREDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS.\u0094 Shares in less\nthan Creation Units are not distributed by the\nDistributor. The Distributor will deliver the\nProspectus to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nand confirmations of acceptance furnished by\nit. The Distributor is a broker-dealer\nregistered under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the\n\u0093Exchange Act\u0094) and a member of the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority (\u0093FINRA\u0094). The\nDistributor has no role in determining the\ninvestment policies of the Trust or which\nsecurities are to be purchased or sold by the\nTrust.\nAn affiliate of the Distributor may assist\nAuthorized Participants (as defined below) in\nassembling shares to purchase Creation Units\nor upon redemption, for which it may receive\ncommissions or other fees from such Authorized\nParticipants. An\naffiliate of the Distributor also receives\ncompensation from State Street for providing\non-line creation and redemption functionality\nto Authorized Participants through its Fund\nConnect application.\n\nThe Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of\nthe Adviser or Distributor, may directly or\nindirectly make cash payments to certain\nbroker-dealers for\nparticipating in activities that are designed\nto make registered representatives and other\nprofessionals more knowledgeable about\nexchange traded products, including the SPDR\nfunds, or for other activities, such as\nparticipation in marketing\nactivities and presentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems.\n\nIn addition, as\nof the date of this SAI, the Adviser and/or\nDistributor had arrangements whereby they may\nmake payments, other than for the educational\nprograms and marketing activities described\nabove, to Pershing LLC (\u0093Pershing\u0094), RBC\nCapital Markets,\nLLC (\u0093RBC\u0094), LPL Financial, LLC (\u0093LPL\u0094), and\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management, LLC. These\namounts, which may be significant, are paid by\nthe Adviser and/or Distributor from their own\nresources and not from Fund assets. Pursuant\nto these arrangements, Pershing, RBC and LPL\nhave agreed to offer certain SPDR funds to\ntheir customers and not to charge certain of\ntheir customers any commissions when those\ncustomers purchase or sell shares of certain\nSPDR funds. Payments to a\nbroker-dealer or intermediary may create\npotential conflicts of interest between the\nbroker dealer or intermediary and its clients.\n\nIn addition, the\nAdviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of the\nAdviser or Distributor, as well as an index\nprovider that is not affiliated with the\nAdviser or Distributor, may also reimburse\nexpenses or make payments from their own\nassets to other persons in\nconsideration of services or other activities\nthat they believe may benefit the SPDR\nbusiness or facilitate investment in SPDR\nfunds.\n\nThe Distribution\nAgreement provides that it may be terminated\nat any time, without the payment of any\npenalty, as to the Fund: (i) by vote of a\nmajority of the Independent Trustees or (ii)\nby vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund, on\nat least 60 days\u0092 written notice to the\nDistributor. The Distribution Agreement is\nalso terminable upon 60 days\u0092 notice by the\nDistributor and will terminate automatically\nin the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).\n\nThe continuation of the Distribution Agreement\nand any other related agreements is subject to\nannual approval of\nthe Board, including by a majority of the\nIndependent Trustees, as described above.\n\n32\n\nThe allocation among the Trust\u0092s series of\nfees and expenses payable under the\nDistribution Agreement will\nbe made pro rata in accordance with the daily\nnet assets of the respective series.\n\nThe Distributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers\n(\u0093Soliciting Dealers\u0094) who will solicit\npurchases of Creation Unit aggregations of\nShares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be\nParticipating Parties (as defined in the \u0093Book\nEntry Only System\u0094 section below) and/or DTC\nParticipants (as defined below).\n\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the\nTrust has agreed to indemnify the Distributor,\nand may indemnify Soliciting\nDealers and Authorized Participants (as\ndescribed below) entering into agreements with\nthe Distributor, for certain liabilities,\nincluding certain liabilities arising under\nthe federal securities laws, unless such loss\nor liability results from\nwillful misfeasance, bad faith or gross\nnegligence in the performance of its duties or\nthe reckless disregard of its obligations and\nduties under the Distribution Agreement or\nother agreement, as applicable.\n\nINDEX PROVIDER AND OTHER PERSONS\n\nAn unaffiliated index provider\nmay make payments from its own assets to other\npersons in consideration for services provided\nor other activities that may facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds.\n\nBROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS\n\nAll portfolio transactions are placed on\nbehalf of the Fund by the Adviser. Purchases\nand sales of securities on a securities\nexchange are affected through\nbrokers who charge a commission for their\nservices. Ordinarily commissions are not\ncharged on over the counter orders (e.g.,\nfixed income securities) because the Fund pays\na spread which is included in the cost of the\nsecurity and represents the\ndifference between the dealer\u0092s quoted price\nat which it is willing to sell the security\nand the dealer\u0092s quoted price at which it is\nwilling to buy the security. When the Fund\nexecutes an over the counter order with an\nelectronic\ncommunications network or an alternative\ntrading system, a commission is charged\nbecause electronic communications networks and\nalternative trading systems execute such\norders on an agency basis. Securities may be\npurchased from underwriters at\nprices that include underwriting fees.\n\nIn placing a portfolio transaction, the\nAdviser seeks to achieve best execution. The\nAdviser\u0092s duty to seek\nbest execution requires the Adviser to take\nreasonable steps to obtain for the client as\nfavorable an overall result as possible for\nFund portfolio transactions under the\ncircumstances, taking into account various\nfactors that are relevant to the\nparticular transaction.\n\nThe Adviser refers to and selects from the\nlist of approved trading counterparties\nmaintained by the Adviser\u0092s Credit Risk\nManagement team. In selecting a trading\ncounterparty for a particular trade, the\nAdviser seeks to weigh relevant factors\nincluding, but not limited to the following:\n                                      \n      Prompt and reliable execution;  \n                                      \n                                              \n      The competitiveness of commission       \n      rates and spreads, if applicable;       \n                                              \n                                              \n      The financial strength, stability       \n      and/or reputation of the trading        \n      counterparty;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      The willingness and ability of the      \n      executing trading counterparty to       \n      execute transactions (and commit        \n      capital) of                             \n      size in liquid and illiquid markets     \n      without disrupting the market for the   \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      Local laws, regulations or              \n      restrictions;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      The ability of the trading              \n      counterparty to maintain                \n      confidentiality;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      The availability and capability of      \n      execution venues, including electronic  \n      communications networks for trading     \n      and                                     \n      execution management systems made       \n      available to Adviser;                   \n                                              \n                     \n      Market share;  \n                     \n                  \n      Liquidity;  \n                  \n              \n      Price;  \n              \n                                \n      Execution related costs;  \n                                \n                                       \n      History of execution of orders;  \n                                       \n                                              \n      Likelihood of execution and             \n      settlement;                             \n                                              \n                              \n      Order size and nature;  \n                              \n33\n                                              \n      Clearing and settlement capabilities,   \n      especially in high volatility market    \n      environments;                           \n                                              \n                                            \n      Availability of lendable securities;  \n                                            \n                                              \n      Sophistication of the trading           \n      counterparty\u0092s trading capabilities and  \n      infrastructure/facilities;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      The operational efficiency with which   \n      transactions are processed and          \n      cleared, taking into account the order  \n      size                                    \n      and complexity;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Speed and responsiveness to the         \n      Adviser;                                \n                                              \n                                    \n      Access to secondary markets;  \n                                    \n                                  \n      Counterparty exposure; and  \n                                  \n                                              \n      Any other consideration the Adviser     \n      believes is relevant to the execution   \n      of the order.                           \n                                              \nIn selecting a trading counterparty, the price\nof the transaction and costs related to the\nexecution of the transaction typically merit a\nhigh relative\nimportance, depending on the circumstances.\nThe Adviser does not necessarily select a\ntrading counterparty based upon price and\ncosts but may take other relevant factors into\naccount if it believes that these are\nimportant in taking reasonable steps\nto obtain the best possible result for the\nFund under the circumstances. Consequently,\nthe Adviser may cause a client to pay a\ntrading counterparty more than another trading\ncounterparty might have charged for the same\ntransaction in recognition of\nthe value and quality of the brokerage\nservices provided. The following matters may\ninfluence the relative importance that the\nAdviser places upon the relevant factors:\n\n(i) The nature and characteristics of the\norder or transaction. For example, size of\norder, market impact of order, limits, or\nother\ninstructions relating to the order;\n\n(ii) The characteristics of the financial\ninstrument(s) or other assets which are the\nsubject of that\norder. For example, whether the order pertains\nto an equity, fixed income, derivative or\nconvertible instrument;\n\n(iii) The characteristics\nof the execution venues to which that order\ncan be directed, if relevant. For example,\navailability and capabilities of electronic\ntrading systems;\n\n(iv) Whether the transaction is a \u0091delivery\nversus payment\u0092 or \u0091over the counter\u0092\ntransaction. The creditworthiness of the\ntrading counterparty, the amount of existing\nexposure to a trading counterparty and trading\ncounterparty settlement capabilities may be\ngiven a higher relative importance in the case\nof \u0091over the counter\u0092 transactions; and\n\n(v) Any other circumstances relevant the\nAdviser believes is relevant at the time.\n\nThe process by which trading counterparties\nare selected to effect transactions is\ndesigned to exclude consideration of the sales\nefforts conducted by\nbroker-dealers in relation to the Fund.\n\nThe Adviser does not currently use the Fund\u0092s\nassets in connection with third party soft\ndollar\narrangements. While the Adviser does not\ncurrently use \u0093soft\u0094 or commission dollars\npaid by the Fund for the purchase of third\nparty research, the Adviser reserves the right\nto do so in the future.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not pay\nbrokerage commissions during the past three\nfiscal years.\n\nSecurities of \u0093Regular Broker-Dealers.\u0094 The\nFund is required to identify any securities of\nits \u0093regular brokers and dealers\u0094 (as such\nterm\nis defined in the 1940 Act) which it may hold\nat the close of its most recent fiscal year.\n\u0093Regular brokers or dealers\u0094 of the Trust are\nthe ten brokers or dealers that, during the\nmost recent fiscal year: (i) received the\ngreatest\ndollar amounts of brokerage commissions from\nthe Trust\u0092s portfolio transactions; (ii)\nengaged as principal in the largest dollar\namounts of portfolio transactions of the\nTrust; or (iii) sold the largest dollar\namounts of the\nTrust\u0092s shares.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any holdings in Securities of Regular\nBroker-Dealers as of June 30, 2020.\n\nPortfolio Turnover. Portfolio turnover may\nvary from year to year, as well as within a\nyear. High turnover\nrates are likely to result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses or transaction\ncosts. The overall reasonableness of brokerage\ncommissions and transaction costs is evaluated\nby the Adviser based upon its knowledge of\navailable information as\nto the general level of commissions and\ntransaction costs paid by other institutional\ninvestors for comparable services.\n\n34\n\nBOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM\n\nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u0093ADDITIONAL\nPURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION.\u0094\n\nThe Depository Trust Company (\u0093DTC\u0094) acts as\nsecurities depositary for the Shares. Shares\nof the Fund are represented by\nsecurities registered in the name of DTC or\nits nominee, Cede & Co., and deposited with,\nor on behalf of, DTC. Except in the limited\ncircumstance provided below, certificates will\nnot be issued for Shares.\n\nDTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was\ncreated to hold securities of its participants\n(the \u0093DTC Participants\u0094) and to facilitate the\nclearance\nand settlement of securities transactions\namong the DTC Participants in such securities\nthrough electronic book-entry changes in\naccounts of the DTC Participants, thereby\neliminating the need for physical movement of\nsecurities certificates. DTC\nParticipants include securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations,\nsome of whom (and/or their representatives)\nown DTC. More specifically, DTC is owned by a\nnumber of its DTC\nParticipants and by the New York Stock\nExchange (\u0093NYSE\u0094) and FINRA. Access to the DTC\nsystem is also available to others such as\nbanks, brokers, dealers and trust companies\nthat clear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC\nParticipant, either directly or indirectly\n(the \u0093Indirect Participants\u0094).\n\nBeneficial ownership of Shares is limited to\nDTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in Shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as\n\u0093Beneficial Owners\u0094) is\nshown on, and the transfer of ownership is\neffected only through, records maintained by\nDTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on\nthe records of DTC Participants (with respect\nto Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC\nParticipants). Beneficial Owners will receive\nfrom or through the DTC Participant a written\nconfirmation relating to their purchase of\nShares.\n\nConveyance\nof all notices, statements and other\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the Shares of the\nFund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust,\neither directly or through a third party\nservice, shall inquire of each such DTC\nParticipant as to the number of Beneficial\nOwners holding Shares, directly or\nindirectly, through such DTC Participant. The\nTrust, either directly or through a third\nparty service, shall provide each such DTC\nParticipant with copies of such notice,\nstatement or other communication, in such\nform, number and at such place as\nsuch DTC Participant may reasonably request,\nin order that such notice, statement or\ncommunication may be transmitted by such DTC\nParticipant, directly or indirectly, to such\nBeneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust\nshall pay to each such DTC\nParticipant and/or third party service a fair\nand reasonable amount as reimbursement for the\nexpenses attendant to such transmittal, all\nsubject to applicable statutory and regulatory\nrequirements.\n\nShare distributions shall be made to DTC or\nits nominee, Cede & Co., as the registered\nholder of all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon\nreceipt of any\nsuch distributions, shall credit immediately\nDTC Participants\u0092 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in Shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC\nParticipants to Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners of Shares held through such\nDTC Participants will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is\nnow the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in\nbearer form or registered in a \u0093street name,\u0094\nand will be the responsibility of such DTC\nParticipants.\n\nThe Trust has no responsibility or\nliability for any aspects of the records\nrelating to or notices to Beneficial Owners,\nor payments made on account of beneficial\nownership interests in such Shares, or for\nmaintaining, supervising or reviewing any\nrecords relating to such beneficial\nownership interests or for any other aspect of\nthe relationship between DTC and the DTC\nParticipants or the relationship between such\nDTC Participants and the Indirect Participants\nand Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC\nParticipants.\n\nDTC may determine to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to Shares at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its\nresponsibilities with respect thereto under\napplicable law. Under such circumstances, the\nTrust shall take action either to find a\nreplacement for DTC to perform its functions\nat a comparable cost or, if such a replacement\nis unavailable, to issue\nand deliver printed certificates representing\nownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes\nother arrangements with respect thereto\nsatisfactory to the Exchange.\n\nCONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF\nSECURITIES\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations prior to\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any beneficial owners that owned greater\nthan 5% of the\noutstanding voting securities as of the date\nof this SAI.\n\n35\n\nAn Authorized Participant (as defined below)\nmay hold of record more than 25% of the\noutstanding Shares. From\ntime to time, Authorized Participants may be a\nbeneficial and/or legal owner of the Fund, may\nbe affiliated with an index provider, may be\ndeemed to have control of the Fund and/or may\nbe able to affect the outcome of matters\npresented for a vote of\nthe shareholders of the Fund. Authorized\nParticipants may execute an irrevocable proxy\ngranting the Distributor or another affiliate\nof State Street (the \u0093Agent\u0094) power to vote or\nabstain from voting such Authorized\nParticipant\u0092s\nbeneficially or legally owned Shares. In such\ncases, the Agent shall mirror vote (or abstain\nfrom voting) such Shares in the same\nproportion as all other beneficial owners of\nthe Fund.\n\nThe Trustees and Officers of the Trust, as a\ngroup, own less than 1% of the Trust\u0092s voting\nsecurities as of the date of this SAI.\n\nPURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\n\nThe Fund issues and redeems its Shares on a\ncontinuous basis, at net asset value, only in\na large specified number of Shares called a\n\u0093Creation\nUnit,\u0094 either principally in-kind for\nsecurities included in the Index or in cash\nfor the value of such securities. The value of\nthe Fund is determined once each business day,\nas described under\n\u0093Determination of Net Asset Value.\u0094 A Creation\nUnit of the Fund consists of 25,000 Shares,\nbut may change. Authorized Participants (as\ndefined below) will be notified of such\nchange. The principal consideration for\ncreations and\nredemptions for the Fund is in-kind, although\nthis may be revised at any time without\nnotice.\n\nPURCHASE\n(CREATION). The Trust issues and sells Shares\nof the Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Principal\nUnderwriter, without a sales load (but subject\nto transaction fees), at their NAV per share\nnext determined after receipt of\nan order, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), in proper form pursuant to the terms\nof the Authorized Participant Agreement\n(\u0093Participant Agreement\u0094). A \u0093Business Day\u0094\nwith respect to the Fund is, generally, any\nday on which\nthe NYSE is open for business, plus Veterans\nDay and Columbus Day.\n\nFUND DEPOSIT. The consideration for purchase\nof a Creation Unit of the Fund generally\nconsists of either (i) the in-kind deposit of\na designated portfolio of securities (the\n\u0093Deposit Securities\u0094) per each Creation Unit\nconstituting a substantial replication, or a\nportfolio\nsampling representation, of the securities\nincluded in the Fund\u0092s benchmark Index and the\nCash Component (defined below), computed as\ndescribed below or (ii) the cash value of the\nDeposit Securities (\u0093Deposit Cash\u0094) and\n\u0093Cash Component,\u0094 computed as described below.\nWhen accepting purchases of Creation Units for\ncash, the Fund may incur additional costs\nassociated with the acquisition of Deposit\nSecurities that would otherwise be provided by\nan in-kind purchaser.\n\nTogether, the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, and the Cash Component\nconstitute\nthe \u0093Fund Deposit,\u0094 which represents the\nminimum initial and subsequent investment\namount for a Creation Unit of the Fund. The\n\u0093Cash Component\u0094 which may include a Dividend\nEquivalent Payment, is an amount equal to the\ndifference\nbetween the net asset value of the Shares (per\nCreation Unit) and the market value of the\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable. The \u0093Dividend Equivalent Payment\u0094\nenables the Fund to make a complete\ndistribution of dividends on\nthe day preceding the next dividend payment\ndate, and is an amount equal, on a per\nCreation Unit basis, to the dividends on all\nthe portfolio securities of the Fund\n(\u0093Dividend Securities\u0094) with\nex-dividend dates within the accumulation\nperiod for such distribution (the\n\u0093Accumulation Period\u0094), net of expenses and\nliabilities for such period, as if all of the\nDividend Securities had been held\nby the Fund for the entire Accumulation\nPeriod. The Accumulation Period begins on the\nex-dividend date for the Fund and ends on the\nday preceding the next ex-dividend\ndate. If the Cash Component is a positive\nnumber (i.e., the net asset value per Creation\nUnit exceeds the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),\nthe Cash Component shall be such positive\namount. If the Cash\nComponent is a negative number (i.e., the net\nasset value per Creation Unit is less than the\nmarket value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash\nComponent shall be such negative amount and\nthe creator will be\nentitled to receive cash in an amount equal to\nthe Cash Component. The Cash Component serves\nthe function of compensating for any\ndifferences between the net asset value per\nCreation Unit and the market value of the\nDeposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable. Computation of the Cash\nComponent excludes any stamp duty or other\nsimilar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities, if applicable, which shall\nbe the sole responsibility of the\nAuthorized Participant (as defined below).\n\nThe Custodian, through NSCC, makes available\non each Business Day, prior to the opening of\nbusiness on the\nExchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time),\nthe list of the names and the required number\nof shares of each Deposit Security or the\nrequired amount of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, to be included in the current Fund\nDeposit (based on information at\nthe end of the previous Business Day) for the\nFund. Such Fund Deposit is subject to any\napplicable adjustments as described below, in\norder to effect purchases of Creation Units of\nthe Fund until such time as the next-announced\ncomposition of the\nDeposit Securities or the required amount of\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, is made\navailable.\n\nThe identity and number of shares of the\nDeposit Securities\nor the amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable,\nrequired for a Fund Deposit for the Fund\nchanges as rebalancing adjustments, interest\npayments and corporate action events are\nreflected from time to time by the Adviser\nwith a view to the investment\nobjective of the Fund. Information regarding a\nFund Deposit necessary for the purchase of a\n\n36\n\nCreation Unit is made available to Authorized\nParticipants and other market participants\nseeking to transact in Creation Unit\naggregations. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also\nchange in response to adjustments to the\nweighting or composition of the component\nsecurities of the Fund\u0092s Index.\n\nAs noted above, the Trust\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Cash to replace any\nDeposit Security, which shall be added to the\nCash Component, including, without limitation,\nin situations where the Deposit Security: (i)\nmay not be\navailable in sufficient quantity for delivery,\n(ii) may not be eligible for transfer through\nthe systems of DTC for corporate securities\nand municipal securities or the Federal\nReserve System for U.S. Treasury securities;\n(iii) may not be\neligible for trading by an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below) or the investor\nfor which it is acting; (iv) would be\nrestricted under the securities laws or where\nthe delivery of the Deposit Security to the\nAuthorized Participant would\nresult in the disposition of the Deposit\nSecurity by the Authorized Participant\nbecoming restricted under the securities laws,\nor (v) in certain other situations\n(collectively, \u0093non-standard\norders\u0094). The Trust also reserves the right\nto: (i) permit or require the substitution of\nDeposit Securities in lieu of Deposit Cash;\nand (ii) include or remove Deposit Securities\nfrom the basket in anticipation of index\nrebalancing\nchanges. The adjustments described above will\nreflect changes, known to the Adviser on the\ndate of announcement to be in effect by the\ntime of delivery of the Fund Deposit, in the\ncomposition of the subject Index being tracked\nby the Fund or\nresulting from certain corporate actions.\n\nPROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the Principal\nUnderwriter, as\nfacilitated via the Transfer Agent, to\npurchase a Creation Unit of the Fund, an\nentity must be (i) a \u0093Participating Party\u0094,\ni.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in\nthe clearing process through the Continuous\nNet\nSettlement System of the NSCC (the \u0093Clearing\nProcess\u0094), a clearing agency that is\nregistered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC\nParticipant (see \u0093BOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM\u0094). In\naddition, each Participating Party or DTC\nParticipant\n(each, an \u0093Authorized Participant\u0094) must\nexecute a Participant Agreement that has been\nagreed to by the Principal Underwriter and the\nTransfer Agent, and that has been accepted by\nthe Trust, with respect to purchases and\nredemptions of\nCreation Units. Each Authorized Participant\nwill agree, pursuant to the terms of a\nParticipant Agreement, on behalf of itself or\nany investor on whose behalf it will act, to\ncertain conditions, including that it will pay\nto the Trust, an amount of\ncash sufficient to pay the Cash Component\ntogether with the creation transaction fee\n(described below) and any other applicable\nfees, taxes and additional variable charge.\n\nAll orders to purchase Shares directly from\nthe Fund, including non-standard orders, must\nbe placed for one or more\nCreation Units and in the manner and by the\ntime set forth in the Participant Agreement\nand/or the applicable order form. The date on\nwhich an order to purchase Creation Units (or\nan order to redeem Creation Units, as set\nforth below) is received\nand accepted is referred to as the \u0093Order\nPlacement Date.\u0094\n\nAn Authorized Participant may require an\ninvestor to make certain representations or\nenter into agreements with respect to the\norder (e.g., to provide for payments of cash,\nwhen required). Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not have executed\na Participant Agreement and that, therefore,\norders to\npurchase Shares directly from the Fund in\nCreation Units have to be placed by the\ninvestor\u0092s broker through an Authorized\nParticipant that has executed a Participant\nAgreement. In such cases there may be\nadditional charges to such investor. At\nany given time, there may be only a limited\nnumber of broker-dealers that have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and only a small number\nof such Authorized Participants may have\ninternational capabilities.\n\nOn days when the Exchange or the bond markets\nclose earlier than normal, the Fund may\nrequire orders to create Creation Units to be\nplaced earlier in the day.\nIn addition, if a market or markets on which\nthe Fund\u0092s investments are primarily traded is\nclosed, the Fund will also generally not\naccept orders on such day(s). Orders must be\ntransmitted by an Authorized Participant by\ntelephone or other\ntransmission method acceptable to the\nDistributor pursuant to procedures set forth\nin the Participant Agreement and in accordance\nwith the applicable order form. Those placing\norders through an Authorized Participant\nshould allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nby the cut-off time. Economic or market\ndisruptions or changes, or telephone or other\ncommunication failure may impede the ability\nto reach the Distributor or an\nAuthorized Participant.\n\nFund Deposits must be delivered by an\nAuthorized Participant through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government\nsecurities), or through DTC (for corporate\nsecurities and municipal securities), through\na subcustody agent (for foreign securities)\nand/or through such other arrangements allowed\nby the Trust or its agents. With respect to\nforeign Deposit\nSecurities, the Custodian shall cause the\nsubcustodian of the Fund to maintain an\naccount into which the Authorized Participant\nshall deliver, on behalf of itself or the\nparty on whose behalf it is acting, such\nDeposit Securities. Foreign Deposit\nSecurities must be delivered to an account\nmaintained at the applicable local\nsubcustodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must\nbe ordered by the Authorized Participant in a\ntimely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of\nthe requisite number of Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, to\nthe account of the Fund or its agents by no\nlater than the Settlement Date. The\n\u0093Settlement Date\u0094 for the Fund is generally\nthe second Business Day (\u0093T+2\u0094) after the\nOrder Placement\nDate. All questions as to the number of\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be\ndelivered, as applicable, and the validity,\nform and eligibility (including time of\nreceipt) for the deposit of any tendered\nsecurities or cash, as applicable, will be\ndetermined by the Trust, whose determination\nshall be final and binding. The amount of cash\nrepresented by the Cash Component must be\ntransferred directly to the Custodian through\nthe Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system\nin a timely\n\n37\n\nmanner so as to be received by the Custodian\nno later than the Settlement Date. If the Cash\nComponent and the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, are not received\nin a timely\nmanner by the Settlement Date, the creation\norder may be cancelled. Upon written notice to\nthe Distributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using a\nFund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect\nthe then current NAV\nof the Fund. The delivery of Creation Units so\ncreated generally will occur no later than the\nsecond Business Day following the day on which\nthe purchase order is deemed received by the\nDistributor.\n\nThe order shall be deemed to be received on\nthe Business Day on which the order is placed\nprovided that the order is placed in proper\nform prior to the\napplicable cut-off time and the federal funds\nin the appropriate amount are deposited by\n2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per\napplicable instructions), with the Custodian\non the Settlement Date. If the\norder is not placed in proper form as\nrequired, or federal funds in the appropriate\namount are not received by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00\np.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, then the\norder may be deemed to be rejected and\nthe Authorized Participant shall be liable to\nthe Fund for losses, if any, resulting\ntherefrom. A creation request is considered to\nbe in \u0093proper form\u0094 if all procedures set\nforth in the Participant Agreement, order form\nand this SAI are\nproperly followed.\n\nISSUANCE OF A CREATION UNIT. Except as\nprovided herein, Creation Units will not be\nissued until the transfer of good title to the\nTrust of the Deposit Securities or payment of\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, and the payment\nof the Cash Component have been completed.\nWhen the subcustodian has confirmed to the\nCustodian that the required Deposit Securities\n(or the cash value\nthereof) have been delivered to the account of\nthe relevant subcustodian or subcustodians,\nthe Principal Underwriter and the Adviser\nshall be notified of such delivery, and the\nTrust will issue and cause the delivery of the\nCreation Units.\n\nIn instances where the Trust accepts Deposit\nSecurities for the purchase of a Creation\nUnit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in\nadvance of receipt by the\nTrust of all or a portion of the applicable\nDeposit Securities as described below. In\nthese circumstances, the initial deposit will\nhave a value greater than the net asset value\nof the Shares on the date the order is placed\nin proper form since in\naddition to available Deposit Securities, cash\nmust be deposited in an amount equal to the\nsum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii) an\nadditional amount of cash equal to a\npercentage of the market value as set forth in\nthe Participant\nAgreement, of the undelivered Deposit\nSecurities (the \u0093Additional Cash Deposit\u0094),\nwhich shall be maintained in a general non-\ninterest bearing collateral account. An\nadditional amount of cash shall be\nrequired to be deposited with the Trust,\npending delivery of the missing Deposit\nSecurities to the extent necessary to maintain\nthe Additional Cash Deposit with the Trust in\nan amount at least equal to the applicable\npercentage, as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement, of the daily marked to\nmarket value of the missing Deposit\nSecurities. The Trust may use such Additional\nCash Deposit to buy the missing Deposit\nSecurities at any time. Authorized\nParticipants will be liable to the Trust for\nall costs, expenses, dividends, income and\ntaxes associated with missing Deposit\nSecurities, including the costs incurred by\nthe Trust in connection with any such\npurchases. These costs will be deemed to\ninclude the amount by which the actual\npurchase price of the Deposit Securities\nexceeds the market value of such Deposit\nSecurities on the day the purchase order was\ndeemed received by the Principal Underwriter\nplus the brokerage and related transaction\ncosts associated with such\npurchases. The Trust will return any unused\nportion of the Additional Cash Deposit once\nall of the missing Deposit Securities have\nbeen properly received by the Custodian or\npurchased by the Trust and deposited into the\nTrust. In addition, a\ntransaction fee as set forth below under\n\u0093Creation Transaction Fees\u0094 will be charged in\nall cases and an additional variable charge\nmay also be applied. The delivery of Creation\nUnits so created generally will occur no later\nthan the\nSettlement Date.\n\nACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF CREATION UNITS. The\nTrust reserves the absolute right to reject an\norder for Creation Units transmitted in\nrespect of the Fund at its discretion,\nincluding, without limitation, if (a) the\norder is not in proper form; (b) the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable,\ndelivered by the Participant are not as\ndisseminated through the\nfacilities of the NSCC for that date by the\nCustodian; (c) the investor(s), upon obtaining\nthe Shares ordered, would own 80% or more of\nthe currently outstanding Shares of the Fund;\n(d) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would\nhave\ncertain adverse tax consequences to the Fund;\n(e) the acceptance of the Fund Deposit would,\nin the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (f)\nthe acceptance of the Fund Deposit would\notherwise, in the discretion of the Trust or\nthe Adviser, have\nan adverse effect on the Trust or the rights\nof beneficial owners; (g) the acceptance or\nreceipt of the order for a Creation Unit\nwould, in the opinion of counsel to the Trust,\nbe unlawful; or (h) in the event that\ncircumstances outside\nthe control of the Trust, the Custodian, the\nTransfer Agent and/or the Adviser make it for\nall practical purposes not feasible to process\norders for Creation Units. Examples of such\ncircumstances include acts of God or public\nservice or utility\nproblems such as fires, floods, extreme\nweather conditions and power outages resulting\nin telephone, telecopy and computer failures;\nmarket conditions or activities causing\ntrading halts; systems failures involving\ncomputer or other information\nsystems affecting the Trust, the Principal\nUnderwriter, the Custodian, the Transfer\nAgent, DTC, NSCC, Federal Reserve System, or\nany other participant in the creation process,\nand other extraordinary events. The Trust or\nits agents shall communicate\nto the Authorized Participant its rejection of\nan order. The Trust, the Transfer Agent, the\nCustodian and the Principal Underwriter are\nunder no duty, however, to give notification\nof any defects or irregularities in the\ndelivery of Fund Deposits\nnor shall either of them incur any liability\nfor the failure to give any such notification.\nThe Trust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian\nand the Principal Underwriter shall not be\nliable for the rejection of any purchase order\nfor Creation Units.\n\n38\n\nAll questions as to the number of shares of\neach security in the Deposit Securities and\nthe validity, form,\neligibility and acceptance for deposit of any\nsecurities to be delivered shall be determined\nby the Trust, and the Trust\u0092s determination\nshall be final and binding.\n\nREDEMPTION. Shares may be redeemed only in\nCreation Units at their net asset value next\ndetermined after receipt of a redemption\nrequest in proper form by the\nFund through the Transfer Agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE\nFUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN\nAMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors\nmust accumulate enough Shares in the secondary\nmarket to constitute a\nCreation Unit in order to have such Shares\nredeemed by the Trust. There can be no\nassurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the public trading\nmarket at any time to permit assembly of a\nCreation Unit. Investors should expect to\nincur brokerage and other costs in connection\nwith assembling a sufficient number of Shares\nto constitute a redeemable Creation Unit.\n\nWith respect to the\nFund, the Custodian, through the NSCC, makes\navailable prior to the opening of business on\nthe Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m. Eastern\ntime) on each Business Day, the list of the\nnames and share quantities of the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio securities that\nwill be applicable (subject to possible\namendment or correction) to redemption\nrequests received in proper form (as defined\nbelow) on that day (\u0093Fund Securities\u0094). Fund\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit\nSecurities.\n\nRedemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are\npaid either in-kind or in cash, or a\ncombination thereof,\nas determined by the Trust. With respect to\nin-kind redemptions of the Fund, redemption\nproceeds for a Creation Unit will consist of\nFund Securities \u0097 as announced by the\nCustodian prior to the opening of\nbusiness on the Business Day of the request\nfor redemption received in proper form plus\ncash in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the net asset value of the Shares\nbeing redeemed, as next determined after a\nreceipt of a request in proper\nform, and the value of the Fund Securities\n(the \u0093Cash Redemption Amount\u0094), less a fixed\nredemption transaction fee and any applicable\nadditional variable charge as set forth below.\nIn the event that the Fund Securities have a\nvalue greater\nthan the net asset value of the Shares, a\ncompensating cash payment equal to the\ndifferential is required to be made by or\nthrough an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, at the Trust\u0092s discretion,\nan Authorized Participant may receive the\ncorresponding cash value of the securities in\nlieu of the in-kind securities value\nrepresenting one or more Fund Securities.\n\nPROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS.\nAfter the Trust has deemed an order for\nredemption received, the Trust will initiate\nprocedures to transfer the\nrequisite Fund Securities and the Cash\nRedemption Amount to the Authorized\nParticipant by the Settlement Date. With\nrespect to in-kind redemptions of the Fund,\nthe calculation of the value of the Fund\nSecurities and the Cash Redemption Amount to\nbe delivered upon redemption will be made by\nthe Custodian according to the procedures set\nforth under \u0093Determination of Net Asset\nValue\u0094, computed on the Business Day on which\na redemption\norder is deemed received by the Trust.\nTherefore, if a redemption order in proper\nform is submitted to the Principal Underwriter\nby a DTC Participant by the specified time on\nthe Order Placement Date, and the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund\nare delivered to the Custodian prior to 2:00\np.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, then the\nvalue of the Fund Securities and the Cash\nRedemption Amount to be delivered will be\ndetermined by the\nCustodian on such Order Placement Date. If the\nrequisite number of Shares of the Fund are not\ndelivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern\ntime (per applicable instructions) on the\nSettlement Date, the Fund will not release the\nunderlying securities\nfor delivery unless collateral is posted in\nsuch percentage amount of missing Shares as\nset forth in the Participant Agreement (marked\nto market daily).\n\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of the\nFund, in connection with taking delivery of\nshares of Fund Securities upon\nredemption of Creation Units, an Authorized\nParticipant must maintain appropriate custody\narrangements with a qualified broker-dealer,\nbank or other custody providers in each\njurisdiction in which any of the Fund\nSecurities are customarily traded\n(or such other arrangements as allowed by the\nTrust or its agents), to which account such\nFund Securities will be delivered. Deliveries\nof redemption proceeds generally will be made\nwithin two Business Days of the trade date.\nDue to the schedule of\nholidays in certain countries, however, the\ndelivery of in-kind redemption proceeds may\ntake longer than two Business Days after the\nday on which the redemption request is\nreceived in proper form. The section\nbelow entitled \u0093Local Market Holiday\nSchedules\u0094 identifies the instances where more\nthan seven days would be needed to deliver\nredemption proceeds. Pursuant to an order of\nthe SEC, in respect of the Fund, the Trust\nwill make delivery of in-kind redemption\nproceeds within the number of days stated in\nthe Local Market Holidays section to be the\nmaximum number of days necessary to deliver\nredemption proceeds. If the Authorized\nParticipant has not made\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nthe Fund Securities in the applicable foreign\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of the Fund\nSecurities in such\njurisdiction, the Trust may, in its\ndiscretion, exercise its option to redeem such\nShares in cash, and the Authorized Participant\nwill be required to receive its redemption\nproceeds in cash.\n\nIf it is not possible to make other such\narrangements, or if it is not possible to\neffect deliveries of the Fund Securities, the\nTrust may in its discretion\nexercise its option to redeem such Shares in\ncash, and the redeeming investor will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in\ncash. In addition, an investor may request a\nredemption in cash that the Fund may, in its\nsole discretion, permit.\nIn either case, the investor will receive a\ncash payment equal to the NAV of its Shares\nbased on the NAV of Shares of the Fund next\ndetermined after the redemption request is\nreceived in proper form (minus a redemption\ntransaction fee and additional\ncharge for requested cash redemptions\nspecified above, to offset the Trust\u0092s\nbrokerage and other transaction costs\nassociated with the disposition\n\n39\n\nof Fund Securities). The Fund may also, in its\nsole discretion, upon request of a\nshareholder, provide such redeemer a portfolio\nof securities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Fund\nSecurities but does not differ in net asset\nvalue.\n\nAn Authorized Participant submitting a\nredemption request is deemed to represent to\nthe Trust that, as\nof the close of the Business Day on which the\nredemption request was submitted, it (or its\nclient) will own (within the meaning of Rule\n200 of Regulation SHO) or has arranged to\nborrow for delivery to the Trust on or prior\nto the Settlement Date of\nthe redemption request, the requisite number\nof Shares of the Fund to be redeemed as a\nCreation Unit. In either case, the Authorized\nParticipant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i)\nit (or its client) has full legal authority\nand legal right to\ntender for redemption the requisite number of\nShares of the Fund and to receive the entire\nproceeds of the redemption; and (ii) if such\nShares submitted for redemption have been\nloaned or pledged to another party or are the\nsubject of a\nrepurchase agreement, securities lending\nagreement or any other arrangement affecting\nlegal or beneficial ownership of such Shares\nbeing tendered, there are no restrictions\nprecluding the tender and delivery of such\nShares (including borrowed\nshares, if any) for redemption, free and clear\nof liens, on the redemption Settlement Date.\nThe Trust reserves the right to verify these\nrepresentations at its discretion, but will\ntypically require verification with respect to\na redemption request\nfrom the Fund in connection with higher levels\nof redemption activity and/or short interest\nin the Fund. If the Authorized Participant,\nupon receipt of a verification request, does\nnot provide sufficient verification of its\nrepresentations as\ndetermined by the Trust, the redemption\nrequest will not be considered to have been\nreceived in proper form and may be rejected by\nthe Trust.\n\nRedemptions\nof Shares for Fund Securities will be subject\nto compliance with applicable federal and\nstate securities laws and the Fund (whether or\nnot it otherwise permits cash redemptions)\nreserves the right to redeem Creation Units\nfor cash to the extent that\nthe Trust could not lawfully deliver specific\nFund Securities upon redemptions or could not\ndo so without first registering the Fund\nSecurities under such laws. An Authorized\nParticipant or an investor for which it is\nacting subject to a legal\nrestriction with respect to a particular\nsecurity included in the Fund Securities\napplicable to the redemption of Creation Units\nmay be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The\nAuthorized Participant may request the\nredeeming investor of the Shares to\ncomplete an order form or to enter into\nagreements with respect to such matters as\ncompensating cash payment. Further, an\nAuthorized Participant that is not a\n\u0093qualified institutional buyer,\u0094 (\u0093QIB\u0094) as\nsuch term is defined under\nRule 144A of the Securities Act, will not be\nable to receive Fund Securities that are\nrestricted securities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may\nbe required by the Trust to provide a written\nconfirmation with respect to\nQIB status in order to receive Fund\nSecurities.\n\nThe right of redemption may be suspended or\nthe date of payment postponed with respect to\nthe Fund\n(1) for any period during which the Exchange\nis closed (other than customary weekend and\nholiday closings); (2) for any period during\nwhich trading on the Exchange is suspended or\nrestricted; (3) for any period during which an\nemergency exists as a result of which disposal\nof the Shares of the Fund or determination of\nthe NAV of the Shares is not reasonably\npracticable; or (4) in such other circumstance\nas is permitted by the SEC.\n\nREQUIRED EARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as described in\nthe Participant Agreement and/or applicable\norder form, the Fund may\nrequire orders to be placed prior to the trade\ndate, as described in the Participant\nAgreement or the applicable order form, in\norder to receive the trade date\u0092s net asset\nvalue. The cut-off time to\nreceive the trade date\u0092s net asset value will\nnot precede the calculation of the net asset\nvalue of the Fund\u0092s shares on the prior\nBusiness Day. Orders to purchase shares of\nsuch funds that are submitted on the Business\nDay immediately\npreceding a holiday or a day (other than a\nweekend) that the equity markets in the\nrelevant foreign market are closed may not be\naccepted. Authorized Participants may be\nnotified that the cut-off time for an\norder may be earlier on a particular Business\nDay, as described in the Participant Agreement\nand the applicable order form.\n\nCREATION AND REDEMPTION\nTRANSACTION FEES. A transaction fee, as set\nforth in the table below, is imposed for the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the purchase or redemption of\nCreation Units, as applicable. Authorized\nParticipants will be required to\npay a fixed creation transaction fee and/or a\nfixed redemption transaction fee, as\napplicable, on a given day regardless of the\nnumber of Creation Units created or redeemed\non that day. The Fund may adjust the\ntransaction fee from time to time. An\nadditional charge or a variable charge\n(discussed below) will be applied to certain\ncreation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standard orders and whole or\npartial cash purchases or redemptions. With\nrespect to creation orders, Authorized\nParticipants are responsible for the costs of\ntransferring the securities constituting the\nDeposit Securities to the account of the Trust\nand with respect to redemption orders,\nAuthorized Participants are\nresponsible for the costs of transferring the\nFund Securities from the Trust to their\naccount or on their order. Investors who use\nthe services of a broker or other such\nintermediary may also be charged a fee for\nsuch services.\n\n40\n\nCreation and Redemption Transaction Fees:\n                                              \n                                     MAXIMUM  \n                  TRANSACT\u2026       TRANSACTI\u2026  \n  FUND             FEE*,\u00a0**         FEE*,\u00a0**  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  SPDR S&P                                    \n  500 ESG      $        500    $       2,000  \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n     From time to time, the Fund may waive    \n     all or a portion of its applicable       \n     transaction fee(s).

Expenses and fees,\nincluding the management fees, are accrued\ndaily and taken into account for purposes of\ndetermining net asset\nvalue. The net asset value of the Fund is\ncalculated by State Street and determined once\ndaily as of the close of the regular trading\nsession on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange\nis open. Fixed-income assets\nare generally valued as of the announced\nclosing time for trading in fixed-income\ninstruments in a particular market or\nexchange. Creation/redemption order cut-off\ntimes may be earlier on any day that the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable exchange or market\non which the Fund\u0092s investments are traded)\nannounces an early closing time. Any assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar\nare converted into U.S. dollars at market\nrates on the date of valuation (generally as\nof 4:00 p.m. London time) as quoted by one or\nmore sources.\n\nIn\ncalculating the Fund\u0092s net asset value per\nShare, the Fund\u0092s investments are generally\nvalued using market valuations. A market\nvaluation generally means a valuation (i)\nobtained from an exchange, a pricing service,\nor a major market\nmaker (or dealer), (ii) based on a price\nquotation or other equivalent indication of\nvalue supplied by an exchange, a pricing\nservice, or a major market maker (or dealer)\nor (iii) based on amortized cost. The Fund\nrelies on a third-party\nservice provider for assistance with the daily\ncalculation of the Fund\u0092s NAV. The third-party\nservice provider, in turn, relies on other\nparties for certain pricing data and other\ninputs used in the calculation of the Fund\u0092s\nNAV.\nTherefore, the Fund is subject to certain\noperational risks associated with reliance on\nits service provider and that service\nprovider\u0092s sources of pricing and other data.\nNAV calculation may be adversely affected by\noperational risks arising\nfrom factors such as errors or failures in\nsystems and technology. Such errors or\nfailures may result in inaccurately calculated\nNAVs, delays in the calculation of NAVs and/or\nthe inability to calculate NAV over extended\ntime periods. The Fund may\nbe unable to recover any losses associated\nwith such failures. In the case of shares of\nother funds that are not traded on an\nexchange, a market valuation means such fund\u0092s\npublished net asset value per share. The\nAdviser may use various\npricing services, or discontinue the use of\nany pricing service, as approved by the Board\nfrom time to time. A price obtained from a\npricing service based on such pricing\nservice\u0092s valuation matrix may be considered a\nmarket valuation.\n\nIn the event that current market valuations\nare not readily available or are deemed\nunreliable, the Trust\u0092s procedures require the\nOversight Committee to\ndetermine a security\u0092s fair value if a market\nprice is not readily available. In determining\nsuch value the Oversight Committee may\nconsider, among other things, (i) price\ncomparisons among multiple sources, (ii) a\nreview of corporate\nactions and news events, and (iii) a review of\nrelevant financial indicators (e.g., movement\nin interest rates, market indices, and prices\nfrom the Fund\u0092s Index Provider). In these\ncases, the Fund\u0092s net asset value may reflect\ncertain portfolio securities\u0092 fair values\nrather than their market prices. The fair\nvalue of a portfolio instrument is generally\nthe price which the Fund might reasonably\nexpect to receive upon its current sale in an\norderly market between\nmarket participants. Ascertaining fair value\nrequires a determination of the amount that an\narm\u0092s-length buyer, under the circumstances,\nwould currently pay for the portfolio\ninstrument. Fair value\npricing involves subjective judgments and it\nis possible that the fair value determination\nfor a security is materially different than\nthe value that could be realized upon the sale\nof the security. In addition, fair value\npricing could result in a\ndifference between the prices used to\ncalculate the Fund\u0092s net asset value and the\nprices used by the Fund\u0092s benchmark Index.\nThis may result in a difference between the\nFund\u0092s performance and the performance of the\nFund\u0092s\nbenchmark Index. With respect to securities\nthat are primarily listed on foreign\nexchanges, the value of the Fund\u0092s portfolio\nsecurities may change on days when you will\nnot be able to purchase or sell your Shares.\n\n41\n\nDIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u0093DISTRIBUTIONS.\u0094\n\nGENERAL POLICIES\n\nDividends from net investment income, if any,\nare generally declared and paid quarterly by\nthe Fund, but may vary significantly from\nperiod to period. Distributions of net\nrealized securities gains, if any, generally\nare declared and paid once a year, but the\nTrust may make distributions on a\nmore frequent basis for the Fund to improve\nindex tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code, in all events in a manner\nconsistent with the provisions of the 1940\nAct.\n\nDividends and other distributions on Shares\nare distributed, as described below, on a pro\nrata basis to Beneficial Owners of such\nShares. Dividend payments\nare made through DTC Participants and Indirect\nParticipants to Beneficial Owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Trust.\n\nManagement of the\nTrust reserves the right to declare special\ndividends if, in its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or advisable to\npreserve the Fund\u0092s eligibility for treatment\nas a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code or to\navoid imposition of\nincome or excise taxes at the Fund level.\n\nDIVIDEND REINVESTMENT\n\nBroker dealers, at their own discretion, may\noffer a dividend reinvestment service under\nwhich Shares are purchased in the secondary\nmarket at current market\nprices. Investors should consult their broker\ndealer for further information regarding any\ndividend reinvestment service offered by such\nbroker dealer.\n\nTAXES\n\nThe following\nis a summary of certain federal income tax\nconsiderations generally affecting the Fund\nand its shareholders that supplements the\ndiscussion in the Prospectus. No attempt is\nmade to present a comprehensive explanation of\nthe federal, state, local or\nforeign tax treatment of the Fund or its\nshareholders, and the discussion here and in\nthe Prospectus is not intended to be a\nsubstitute for careful tax planning.\n\nThe following general discussion of certain\nfederal income tax consequences is based on\nthe Internal Revenue Code and the regulations\nissued thereunder as in\neffect on the date of this SAI. New\nlegislation, as well as administrative changes\nor court decisions, may significantly change\nthe conclusions expressed herein, and may have\na retroactive effect with respect to the\ntransactions contemplated herein.\n\nThe following information should be read in\nconjunction with the section in the Prospectus\nentitled \u0093ADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION.\u0094\n\nTAXATION OF THE FUND. The Fund is treated as a\nseparate corporation for federal income tax\npurposes. The Fund therefore is considered to\nbe a separate entity\nin determining its treatment under the rules\nfor RICs described herein and in the\nProspectus. Losses in one series of the Trust\ndo not offset gains in any other series of the\nTrust and the requirements (other than certain\norganizational\nrequirements) for qualifying for treatment as\na RIC are determined at the Fund level rather\nthan at the Trust level. The Fund has elected\nor will elect and intends to qualify each year\nto be treated as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the\nInternal Revenue Code. As such, the Fund\nshould not be subject to federal income tax on\nits net investment income and capital gains,\nif any, to the extent that it timely\ndistributes such income and capital gains to\nits shareholders. In order to\nqualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must\ndistribute annually to its shareholders at\nleast the sum of 90% of its taxable net\ninvestment income (generally including the\nexcess of net short-term capital gains over\nnet long-term capital losses) and\n90% of its net tax exempt interest income, if\nany (the \u0093Distribution Requirement\u0094) and also\nmust meet several additional requirements.\nAmong these requirements are the following:\n(i) at least 90% of the Fund\u0092s gross income\neach\ntaxable year must be derived from dividends,\ninterest, payments with respect to certain\nsecurities loans, gains from the sale or other\ndisposition of stock, securities or foreign\ncurrencies, or other income derived with\nrespect to its business of\ninvesting in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from\ninterests in qualified publicly traded\npartnerships (the \u0093Qualifying Income\nRequirement\u0094); and (ii) at the end of each\nquarter of the Fund\u0092s taxable\nyear, its assets must be diversified so that\n(a) at least 50% of the market value of its\ntotal assets must be represented by cash and\ncash items, U.S. government securities,\nsecurities of other RICs and other securities,\nwith such other\nsecurities limited, in respect to any one\nissuer, to an amount not greater in value than\n5% of the value of the Fund\u0092s total assets and\nto not more than 10% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of such issuer, and\n\n42\n\n(b) not more than 25% of the value of its\ntotal assets is invested in the securities\n(other than U.S. government securities or\nsecurities of other RICs) of any one issuer,\nthe securities\n(other than securities of other RICs) of two\nor more issuers that it controls and that are\nengaged in the same, similar, or related\ntrades or businesses, or the securities of one\nor more qualified publicly traded partnerships\n(the\n\u0093Diversification Requirement\u0094).\n\nIf the Fund fails to satisfy the Qualifying\nIncome Requirement or the Diversification\nRequirement in any\ntaxable year, the Fund may be eligible for\nrelief provisions if the failures are due to\nreasonable cause and not willful neglect and\nif a penalty tax is paid with respect to each\nfailure to satisfy the applicable\nrequirements. Additionally, relief\nis provided for certain de minimis failures of\nthe Diversification Requirement where the Fund\ncorrects the failure within a specified period\nof time. In order to be eligible for the\nrelief provisions with respect to a failure to\nmeet the\nDiversification Requirement, the Fund may be\nrequired to dispose of certain assets. If\nthese relief provisions were not available to\nthe Fund and it were to fail to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of\nits taxable income would\nbe subject to tax at regular corporate rates\nwithout any deduction for distributions to\nshareholders, and its distributions (including\ncapital gains distributions) generally would\nbe taxable as ordinary income dividends to its\nshareholders, subject\nto the dividends-received deduction for\ncorporate shareholders and the lower tax rates\non qualified dividend income received by\nnoncorporate shareholders. To requalify for\ntreatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable\nyear, the Fund would be required\nto satisfy the RIC qualification requirements\nfor that year and to distribute any earnings\nand profits from any year in which the Fund\nfailed to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC.\nIf the Fund failed to qualify as a RIC for a\nperiod greater than two\ntaxable years, it would generally be required\nto pay a Fund-level tax on certain net built-\nin gains recognized with respect to certain of\nits assets upon a disposition of such assets\nwithin five years of\nqualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year. The\nBoard reserves the right not to maintain the\nqualification of the Fund for treatment as a\nRIC if it determines such course of action to\nbe beneficial to shareholders.\n\nAs discussed more fully below, the Fund\nintends to distribute substantially all of its\nnet investment income and its capital gains\nfor each taxable year.\n\nIf the Fund meets the Distribution Requirement\nbut retains some or all of its income or\ngains, it will be subject to federal income\ntax to the extent any such\nincome or gains are not distributed. The Fund\nmay designate certain amounts retained as\nundistributed net capital gain in a notice to\nits shareholders, who (i) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as\nlong-term capital gain, their proportionate\nshares of the undistributed amount so\ndesignated, (ii) will be entitled to credit\ntheir proportionate shares of the income tax\npaid by the Fund on that undistributed amount\nagainst their federal\nincome tax liabilities and to claim refunds to\nthe extent such credits exceed their\nliabilities and (iii) will be entitled to\nincrease their tax basis, for federal income\ntax purposes, in their Shares by an amount\nequal to the excess of the\namount of undistributed net capital gain\nincluded in their respective income over their\nrespective income tax credits. If the Fund\nfailed to satisfy the Distribution Requirement\nfor any taxable year, it would be taxed as a\nregular corporation, with\nconsequences generally similar to those\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph.\n\nGiven the potential concentration of the Index\nin a relatively small number\nof securities, it may not be possible for the\nFund to fully implement a sampling methodology\nwhile satisfying the Diversification\nRequirement. The Fund\u0092s efforts to satisfy the\nDiversification Requirement may affect the\nFund\u0092s execution of\nits investment strategy and may cause the\nFund\u0092s return to deviate from that of the\nIndex, and the Fund\u0092s efforts to track the\nIndex may cause it inadvertently to fail to\nsatisfy the Diversification Requirement.\n\nThe Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on\ncertain undistributed income if it does not\ndistribute to its shareholders in each\ncalendar year an amount at\nleast equal to 98% of its ordinary income for\nthe calendar year plus 98.2% of its capital\ngain net income for the twelve months ended\nOctober 31 of such year, subject to an\nincrease for any shortfall in the prior year\u0092s\ndistribution. The\nFund intends to declare and distribute\ndividends and distributions in the amounts and\nat the times necessary to avoid the\napplication of this 4% excise tax.\n\nThe Fund may elect to treat part or all of any\n\u0093qualified late year loss\u0094 as if it had been\nincurred in the succeeding taxable year in\ndetermining\nthe Fund\u0092s taxable income, net capital gain,\nnet short-term capital gain, and earnings and\nprofits. The effect of this election is to\ntreat any such \u0093qualified late year loss\u0094 as\nif it had been incurred in the succeeding\ntaxable year\nin characterizing Fund distributions for any\ncalendar year. A \u0093qualified late year loss\u0094\ngenerally includes net capital loss, net long-\nterm capital loss, or net short-term capital\nloss incurred after October 31 of the current\ntaxable\nyear (commonly referred to as \u0093post-October\nlosses\u0094) and certain other late-year losses.\n\nCapital losses in excess of capital gains\n(\u0093net\ncapital losses\u0094) are not permitted to be\ndeducted against a RIC\u0092s net investment\nincome. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, potentially subject to certain\nlimitations, the Fund may carry a net capital\nloss from any taxable year\nforward indefinitely to offset its capital\ngains, if any, in years following the year of\nthe loss. To the extent subsequent capital\ngains are offset by such losses, they will not\nresult in U.S. federal income tax liability to\nthe Fund and may not be\ndistributed as capital gains to its\nshareholders. Generally, the Fund may not\ncarry forward any losses other than net\ncapital losses.\n\n43\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u0097DISTRIBUTIONS. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders\nsubstantially all of its investment company\ntaxable income (computed without regard to the\ndeduction for dividends paid), its net tax-\nexempt income, if any, and any net capital\ngain (net recognized long-term\ncapital gains in excess of net recognized\nshort-term capital losses, taking into account\nany capital loss carryforwards). The Fund will\nreport to shareholders annually the amounts of\ndividends paid from ordinary income, the\namount of distributions\nof net capital gain, the portion of dividends\nwhich may qualify for the dividends-received\ndeduction, and the portion of dividends which\nmay qualify for treatment as qualified\ndividend income.\n\nSubject to certain limitations, dividends\nreported by the Fund as qualified dividend\nincome will be taxable to noncorporate\nshareholders at rates of up to\n20%. Dividends may be reported by the Fund as\nqualified dividend income if they are\nattributable to qualified dividend income\nreceived by the Fund. Qualified dividend\nincome includes, in general, subject to\ncertain holding period requirements and\nother requirements, dividend income from\ncertain U.S. and foreign corporations. Subject\nto certain limitations, eligible foreign\ncorporations include those incorporated in\npossessions of the United States, those\nincorporated in certain countries\nwith comprehensive tax treaties with the\nUnited States and other foreign corporations\nif the stock with respect to which the\ndividends are paid is tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the United\nStates. A dividend generally will not be\ntreated as qualified dividend income to the\nextent that (i) the shareholder has not held\nthe stock on which the dividend was paid for\nmore than 60 days during the 121-day period\nthat begins on the date\nthat is 60 days before the date on which the\nstock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, for more than 90 days during the\n181-day period beginning 90 days before such\ndate, (ii) the shareholder is under an\nobligation (whether pursuant to a short sale\nor otherwise) to make related payments with\nrespect to substantially\nsimilar or related property, or (iii) the\nshareholder elects to treat such dividend as\ninvestment income under section 163(d)(4)(B)\nof the Internal Revenue Code. The holding\nperiod requirements described in this\nparagraph apply to\nshareholders\u0092 investments in the Fund and to\nthe Fund\u0092s investments in underlying dividend-\npaying stock. Dividends received by the Fund\nfrom a REIT or another RIC may be treated as\nqualified dividend income generally only to\nthe extent the\ndividend distributions are attributable to\nqualified dividend income received by such\nREIT or RIC. It is expected that any dividends\nreceived by the Fund from a REIT and\ndistributed from that Fund to a shareholder\ngenerally will be taxable to the\nshareholder as ordinary income. Additionally,\nincome derived in connection with the Fund\u0092s\nsecurities lending activities, will, in\ngeneral, not be treated as qualified dividend\nincome. If 95% or more of the Fund\u0092s gross\nincome (calculated\nwithout taking into account net capital gain\nderived from sales or other dispositions of\nstock or securities) consists of qualified\ndividend income, the Fund may report all\ndistributions of such income as qualified\ndividend income.\n\nCertain dividends received by the Fund from\nU.S. corporations (generally, dividends\nreceived by the Fund in respect of any share\nof stock (1) with a tax\nholding period of at least 46 days during the\n91-day period beginning on the date that is 45\ndays before the date on which the stock\nbecomes ex-dividend as to that\ndividend and (2) that is held in an\nunleveraged position) when distributed and\nappropriately so reported by the Fund may be\neligible for the 50% dividends-received\ndeduction generally available to corporations\nunder the Internal Revenue Code.\nDividends received by the Fund from REITs will\nnot be eligible for that deduction. In order\nto qualify for the deduction, corporate\nshareholders must meet the minimum holding\nperiod requirement stated above with respect\nto their Shares, taking into\naccount any holding period reductions from\ncertain hedging or other transactions or\npositions that diminish their risk of loss\nwith respect to their Shares, and, if they\nborrow to acquire or otherwise incur debt\nattributable to Shares, they may be\ndenied a portion of the dividends-received\ndeduction with respect to those Shares. Any\ncorporate shareholder should consult its tax\nadviser regarding the possibility that its tax\nbasis in its Shares may be reduced, for U.S.\nfederal income tax\npurposes, by reason of \u0093extraordinary\ndividends\u0094 received with respect to the Shares\nand, to the extent such basis would be reduced\nbelow zero, current recognition of income may\nbe required.\n\nDistributions from the Fund\u0092s net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be taxable to\nshareholders as ordinary income. Distributions\nfrom the\nFund\u0092s net capital gain will be taxable to\nshareholders at long-term capital gains rates,\nregardless of how long shareholders have held\ntheir Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders\nat rates of up to\n20%. Certain capital gain dividends\nattributable to dividends the Fund receives\nfrom REITs may be taxable to noncorporate\nshareholders at a rate of 25%.\n\nAlthough dividends generally will be treated\nas distributed when paid, any dividend\ndeclared by the Fund in October, November or\nDecember and payable to\nshareholders of record in such a month that is\npaid during the following January will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nas received by shareholders on December 31 of\nthe calendar year in which it was declared.\n\nIf the Fund\u0092s distributions exceed its\nearnings and profits, all or a portion of the\ndistributions made in the taxable year may be\ntreated as a return of\ncapital to shareholders. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not be taxable but\nwill reduce the shareholder\u0092s cost basis and\nresult in a higher capital gain or lower\ncapital loss when the Shares on which the\ndistribution was\nreceived are sold. After a shareholder\u0092s basis\nin the Shares has been reduced to zero,\ndistributions in excess of earnings and\nprofits will be treated as gain from the sale\nof the shareholder\u0092s Shares.\n\nDistributions that are reinvested in\nadditional Shares through the means of a\ndividend reinvestment service, if offered by\nyour broker-dealer, will\nnevertheless be taxable dividends to the same\nextent as if such dividends had been received\nin cash.\n\n44\n\nA 3.8% Medicare contribution tax generally\napplies to all or a portion of the net\ninvestment income of a\nshareholder who is an individual and not a\nnonresident alien for federal income tax\npurposes and who has adjusted gross income\n(subject to certain adjustments) that exceeds\na threshold amount ($250,000 if married filing\njointly or if considered a\n\u0093surviving spouse\u0094 for federal income tax\npurposes, $125,000 if married filing\nseparately, and $200,000 in other cases). This\n3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of\nthe undistributed net investment income of\ncertain shareholders that\nare estates and trusts. For these purposes,\ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains\n(generally including capital gain\ndistributions and capital gains realized on\nthe sale of Shares) are generally taken into\naccount in computing a\nshareholder\u0092s net investment income.\n\nDistributions of ordinary income and capital\ngains may also be subject to foreign, state\nand local taxes\ndepending on a shareholder\u0092s circumstances.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS \u0096 SALE OF SHARES. In\ngeneral, a sale of Shares results in capital\ngain or\nloss, and for individual shareholders, is\ntaxable at a federal rate dependent upon the\nlength of time the Shares were held. A sale of\nShares held for a period of one year or less\nat the time of such sale will, for tax\npurposes, generally result in\nshort-term capital gains or losses, and a sale\nof those held for more than one year will\ngenerally result in long-term capital gains or\nlosses. Long-term capital gains are generally\ntaxed to noncorporate shareholders at rates of\nup to 20%.\n\nGain or loss on the sale of Shares is measured\nby the difference between the amount received\nand the adjusted tax basis of the Shares.\nShareholders should\nkeep records of investments made (including\nShares acquired through reinvestment of\ndividends and distributions) so they can\ncompute the tax basis of their Shares.\n\nA loss realized on a sale of Shares may be\ndisallowed if substantially identical Shares\nare acquired (whether through the reinvestment\nof dividends or\notherwise) within a sixty-one (61) day period\nbeginning thirty (30) days before and ending\nthirty (30) days after the date that the\nShares are disposed of. In such a case, the\nbasis of the\nShares acquired must be adjusted to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss upon the sale of\nShares held for six (6) months or less is\ntreated as long-term capital loss to the\nextent of any amounts treated as distributions\nto the shareholder of\nlong-term capital gain (including any amounts\ncredited to the shareholder as undistributed\ncapital gains).\n\nCOST BASIS REPORTING. The cost basis of Shares\nacquired by purchase will generally be based\non the amount paid for the Shares and then may\nbe subsequently adjusted for other applicable\ntransactions as required by the Internal\nRevenue Code. The difference between the\nselling price and the cost\nbasis of Shares generally determines the\namount of the capital gain or loss realized on\nthe sale or exchange of Shares. Contact the\nbroker through whom you purchased your Shares\nto obtain information with respect to the\navailable cost basis\nreporting methods and elections for your\naccount.\n\nTAXATION OF FUND INVESTMENTS.\n\nDividends and interest received by the Fund on\nforeign securities may give rise to\nwithholding and other taxes imposed by foreign\ncountries. Tax conventions\nbetween certain countries and the United\nStates may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If\nthe Fund meets certain requirements, which\ninclude a requirement that more than 50% of\nthe value of the Fund\u0092s total assets at the\nclose of its respective\ntaxable year consists of certain foreign\nsecurities (generally including foreign\ngovernment securities), then the Fund should\nbe eligible to file an election with the\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094) that may\nenable its shareholders,\nin effect, to receive either the benefit of a\nforeign tax credit, or a tax deduction, with\nrespect to certain foreign and U.S.\npossessions income taxes paid by the Fund,\nsubject to certain limitations. If at least\n50% of the Fund\u0092s total assets\nat the close of each quarter of a taxable year\nconsists of interests in other RICs (including\nmoney market funds and ETFs that are taxable\nas RICs), the Fund may make the same election\nand pass through to its shareholders their pro\nrata shares of\nqualified foreign taxes paid by those other\nRICs and passed through to the Fund for that\ntaxable year. Pursuant to this election, the\nFund would treat the applicable foreign taxes\nas dividends paid to its shareholders. Each\nsuch shareholder would be\nrequired to include a proportionate share of\nthose taxes in gross income as income received\nfrom a foreign source and must treat the\namount so included as if the shareholder had\npaid the foreign tax directly. The shareholder\nmay then either deduct\nthe taxes deemed paid by him or her in\ncomputing his or her taxable income or,\nalternatively, use the foregoing information\nin calculating any foreign tax credit the\nshareholder may be entitled to use against\nsuch shareholder\u0092s federal income\ntax. If the Fund makes this election, the Fund\nwill report annually to its shareholders the\nrespective amounts per share of the Fund\u0092s\nincome from sources within, and taxes paid to,\nforeign countries and U.S. possessions. No\ndeduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If the Fund does not make this\nelection, the Fund will be entitled to claim a\ndeduction for certain foreign taxes incurred\nby the Fund. The Fund does not\nexpect to satisfy the requirements for passing\nthrough to its shareholders any share of any\nforeign taxes paid by the Fund, with the\nresult that shareholders will not include such\ntaxes in their gross incomes and will not be\nentitled to a tax\ndeduction or credit for such taxes on their\nown returns.Under certain circumstances, if\nthe Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes\npaid in respect of a prior year, the value of\nShares could be affected or any foreign tax\ncredits or\ndeductions passed through to shareholders in\nrespect of the Fund\u0092s foreign taxes for the\ncurrent year could be reduced.\n\n45\n\nCertain of the Fund\u0092s investments may be\nsubject to complex provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code\n(including provisions relating to hedging\ntransactions, straddles, integrated\ntransactions, foreign currency contracts,\nforward foreign currency contracts, and\nnotional principal contracts) that, among\nother things, may affect the character of\ngains\nand losses realized by the Fund (i.e., may\naffect whether gains or losses are ordinary or\ncapital), accelerate recognition of income to\nthe Fund and defer losses. These rules could\ntherefore affect the character, amount and\ntiming of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also may require the Fund to mark-\nto-market certain types of positions in its\nportfolio (i.e., treat them as if they were\nclosed out) which may cause the Fund to\nrecognize income without receiving cash with\nwhich to make distributions to its\nshareholders in amounts necessary to satisfy\nthe RIC distribution requirements for avoiding\nincome and excise taxes. The Fund\nintends to monitor its transactions, intends\nto make appropriate tax elections, and intends\nto make appropriate entries in its books and\nrecords in order to mitigate the effect of\nthese rules and preserve the Fund\u0092s\nqualification for treatment\nas a RIC.\n\nThe Fund is required for federal income tax\npurposes to\nmark-to-market and recognize as income for\neach taxable year its net unrealized gains and\nlosses on certain futures contracts as of the\nend of the year as well as those\nactually realized during the year. Gain or\nloss from futures and options contracts on\nbroad-based indexes required to be marked to\nmarket will be 60% long-term and 40% short-\nterm capital gain or loss. Application of this\nrule may alter the timing\nand character of distributions to\nshareholders. The Fund may be required to\ndefer the recognition of losses on futures\ncontracts, options contracts and swaps to the\nextent of any unrecognized gains on offsetting\npositions held by the Fund. It is\nanticipated that certain net gain realized\nfrom the closing out of futures or options\ncontracts will be considered gain from the\nsale of securities and therefore will be\nqualifying income for purposes of the\nQualifying Income Requirement.\n\nFor tax years beginning after December 31,\n2017 and before January 1, 2026, a\nnoncorporate taxpayer is generally eligible\nfor a deduction of up to\n20% of the taxpayer\u0092s \u0093qualified REIT\ndividends.\u0094 If the Fund receives dividends\n(other than capital gain dividends) in respect\nof REIT shares, the Fund may report its own\ndividends as eligible for the 20% deduction,\nto the extent the\nFund\u0092s income is derived from such qualified\nREIT dividends, as reduced by allocable Fund\nexpenses. In order for the Fund\u0092s dividends to\nbe eligible for this deduction when received\nby a noncorporate shareholder, the Fund must\nmeet certain\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe REIT shares on which the Fund received the\neligible dividends, and the noncorporate\nshareholder must meet certain holding period\nrequirements with respect to the Shares.\n\nTAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS. Certain tax-exempt\nshareholders, including qualified\npension plans, individual retirement accounts,\nsalary deferral arrangements, 401(k) plans,\nand other tax-exempt entities, generally are\nexempt from federal income taxation except\nwith respect to their\nunrelated business taxable income (\u0093UBTI\u0094).\nUnder current law, the Fund generally serves\nto block UBTI from being realized by its tax-\nexempt shareholders. However, notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, tax-exempt shareholders could\nrealize UBTI by virtue of their investment in\nthe Fund where, for example, (i) the Fund\ninvests in REITs that hold residual interests\nin real estate mortgage investment conduits\n(\u0093REMICs\u0094) or (ii) Shares constitute debt-\nfinanced property in the hands of the tax-\nexempt shareholders within the meaning of\nsection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCharitable remainder\ntrusts are subject to special rules and should\nconsult their tax advisors. There are no\nrestrictions preventing the Fund from holding\ninvestments in REITs that hold residual\ninterests in REMICs, and the Fund may do so.\nThe IRS has issued guidance\nwith respect to these issues and prospective\nshareholders, especially charitable remainder\ntrusts, are strongly encouraged to consult\nwith their tax advisors regarding these\nissues.\n\nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions\nwill be subject to a 1.4% tax on net\ninvestment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Shares (among other categories\nof income), are generally taken into account\nin computing a shareholder\u0092s net investment\nincome.\n\nFOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends, other than\ncapital gains dividends, \u0093short-term capital\ngain dividends\u0094 and \u0093interest-related\ndividends\u0094\n(described below), paid by the Fund to\nshareholders who are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities will be subject to a 30%\nUnited States withholding tax unless a reduced\nrate of withholding or a withholding exemption\nis provided under applicable\ntreaty law to the extent derived from\ninvestment income and short-term capital gain\nor unless such income is effectively connected\nwith a U.S. trade or business carried on\nthrough a permanent establishment in the\nUnited States. Nonresident\nshareholders are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning the applicability of\nthe United States withholding tax and the\nproper withholding form(s) to be submitted to\nthe Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an appropriate IRS Form\nW-8 may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate.\n\nDividends reported by the Fund as (i)\ninterest-related dividends, to the extent such\ndividends are derived from the Fund\u0092s\n\u0093qualified net\ninterest income,\u0094 or (ii) short-term capital\ngain dividends, to the extent such dividends\nare derived from the Fund\u0092s \u0093qualified short-\nterm gain,\u0094 are generally exempt from this 30%\nwithholding tax. \u0093Qualified net\ninterest income\u0094 is the Fund\u0092s net income\nderived from U.S.-source interest and original\nissue discount, subject to certain exceptions\nand limitations. \u0093Qualified short-term gain\u0094\ngenerally means the excess of the Fund\u0092s net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nover its net long-term capital loss, if any.\nIn the case of Shares held through an\nintermediary, the intermediary may withhold\neven if the Fund reports the payment as an\ninterest-related dividend or as a\nshort-term capital gain dividend. Non-U.S.\nshareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts.\n\n46\n\nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold\nShares comply with IRS\nrequirements that will generally require them\nto report information regarding U.S. persons\ninvesting in, or holding accounts with, such\nentities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to\nFund distributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the\nwithholding described in this paragraph under\nan applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the\nterms of such agreement.\n\nNon-U.S. persons are subject to U.S. tax\non disposition of a \u0093United States real\nproperty interest\u0094 (a \u0093USRPI\u0094). Gain on such a\ndisposition is sometimes referred to as\n\u0093FIRPTA gain.\u0094 The Internal Revenue Code\nprovides a look-through rule for distributions\nof\n\u0093FIRPTA gain\u0094 if certain requirements are met.\nIf the look-through rule applies, certain\ndistributions attributable to income treated\nas received by the Fund from REITs may be\ntreated as gain from the disposition of a\nUSRPI, causing\ndistributions to be subject to U.S.\nwithholding tax at rates of up to 21%, and\nrequiring non-U.S. investors to file\nnonresident U.S. income tax returns. Also,\nFIRPTA gain may be subject to a 30% branch\nprofits\ntax in the hands of a non-U.S. shareholder\nthat is treated as a corporation for federal\nincome tax purposes. Under certain\ncircumstances, Shares may qualify as USRPIs,\nwhich could result in 15% withholding on\ncertain distributions and gross redemption\nproceeds paid to certain non-U.S. investors.\n\nBACKUP WITHHOLDING. The\nFund will be required in certain cases to\nwithhold (as \u0093backup withholding\u0094) on amounts\npayable to any shareholder who (1) has\nprovided the Fund either an incorrect tax\nidentification number or no number at all, (2)\nis subject to\nbackup withholding by the IRS for failure to\nproperly report payments of interest or\ndividends, (3) has failed to certify to the\nFund that such shareholder is not subject to\nbackup withholding, or (4) has not certified\nthat such\nshareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S.\nresident alien). The backup withholding rate\nis currently 24%. Backup withholding will not\nbe applied to payments that have been subject\nto the 30% withholding tax on shareholders who\nare neither\ncitizens nor permanent residents of the U.S.\n\nCREATION UNITS. An Authorized Participant who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units\ngenerally will\nrecognize a gain or a loss. The gain or loss\nwill be equal to the difference between the\nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time\nand the sum of the exchanger\u0092s aggregate basis\nin the securities surrendered plus the amount\nof cash paid\nfor such Creation Units. A person who redeems\nCreation Units will generally recognize a gain\nor loss equal to the difference between the\nexchanger\u0092s basis in the Creation Units and\nthe sum of the aggregate market value of any\nsecurities\nreceived plus the amount of any cash received\nfor such Creation Units. The IRS, however, may\nassert that a loss realized upon an exchange\nof securities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing\n\u0093wash sales,\u0094\nor on the basis that there has been no\nsignificant change in economic position.\n\nAny gain or loss realized upon a creation of\nCreation Units will be\ntreated as capital gain or loss if the\nAuthorized Participant holds the securities\nexchanged therefor as capital assets, and\notherwise will be ordinary income or loss.\nSimilarly, any gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption of Creation Units will be\ntreated as capital gain or loss if the\nAuthorized Participant holds the Shares\ncomprising the Creation Units as capital\nassets, and otherwise will be ordinary income\nor loss. Any capital gain or loss realized\nupon the creation of Creation Units will\ngenerally be treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss if the securities exchanged for such\nCreation Units have been held for more than\none year, and otherwise will be short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon the\nredemption of Creation Units will generally be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss if\nthe Shares comprising the Creation Units have\nbeen held for more than one year, and\notherwise, will generally be short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Any capital\nloss realized upon a redemption of Creation\nUnits held for six (6) months or less will be\ntreated as a long-term capital loss to the\nextent of any amounts treated as distributions\nto the applicable Authorized Participant of\nlong-term capital\ngains with respect to the Creation Units\n(including any amounts credited to the\nAuthorized Participant as undistributed\ncapital gains).\n\nThe Fund has the\nright to reject an order for Creation Units if\nthe purchaser (or a group of purchasers)\nwould, upon obtaining the Shares so ordered,\nown 80% or more of the outstanding shares of\nthe Fund and if, pursuant to section 351 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code,\nthe Fund would have a basis in any deposit\nsecurities different from the market value of\nsuch securities on the date of deposit. The\nFund also has the right to require information\nnecessary to determine beneficial Share\nownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Fund does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser\n(or a group of purchasers) may\nnot recognize gain or loss upon the exchange\nof securities for Creation Units.\n\nPersons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units\nshould consult their own\ntax advisors with respect to the tax treatment\nof any creation or redemption transaction.\n\nCERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\nUnder promulgated\nTreasury regulations, if a shareholder\nrecognizes a loss on disposition of the Fund\u0092s\nshares of $2 million or more for an individual\nshareholder or $10 million or more for a\ncorporate shareholder (or certain greater\namounts over a\ncombination of years), the shareholder must\nfile with the IRS a disclosure\n\n47\n\nstatement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not\nexcepted. A shareholder who fails to make the\nrequired disclosure to the IRS may be subject\nto adverse tax consequences, including\nsignificant penalties. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal\ndetermination of whether the taxpayer\u0092s\ntreatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders\nshould consult their tax advisers to determine\nthe applicability of these regulations in\nlight of their individual circumstances.\n\nThe foregoing discussion is a summary only and\nis not intended as a substitute for careful\ntax planning. Purchasers of Shares should\nconsult their own tax\nadvisors as to the tax consequences of\ninvesting in such Shares, including under\nstate, local and other tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date hereof. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.\n\nCAPITAL STOCK AND SHAREHOLDER REPORTS\n\nThe Fund issues shares of beneficial interest,\npar value $.01 per Share. The Board may\ndesignate additional funds.\n\nEach Share issued by the Trust has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of the corresponding\nseries of the Trust. Shares have no\npreemptive, exchange,\nsubscription or conversion rights and are\nfreely transferable. Each Share is entitled to\nparticipate equally in dividends and\ndistributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the Fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of the Fund on\nliquidation.\n\nEach Share has one vote with respect to\nmatters upon which a shareholder vote is\nrequired consistent with the requirements of\nthe 1940 Act\nand the rules promulgated thereunder. Shares\nof all series of the Trust (\u0093Funds\u0094) vote\ntogether as a single class except that if the\nmatter being voted on affects only a\nparticular fund it will be voted on only by\nthat fund and if a matter\naffects a particular fund differently from\nother Funds, that fund will vote separately on\nsuch matter. Under Massachusetts law, the\nTrust is not required to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. The\npolicy of the Trust is not to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights for the election of Trustees.\nUnder Massachusetts\nlaw, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by\nvote of the shareholders.\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, shareholders of a\nbusiness trust may, under certain\ncircumstances, be held personally liable as\npartners for obligations of the Trust.\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an\nexpress disclaimer of shareholder liability\nfor acts or obligations of the Trust, requires\nthat Trust obligations\ninclude such disclaimer, and provides for\nindemnification and reimbursement of expenses\nout of the Trust\u0092s property for any\nshareholder held personally liable for the\nobligations of the Trust. Thus, the risk of a\nshareholder incurring financial\nloss on account of shareholder liability is\nlimited to circumstances in which the Trust\nitself would be unable to meet its\nobligations. Given the above limitations on\nshareholder personal liability, and the nature\nof the Fund\u0092s assets and\noperations, the risk to shareholders of\npersonal liability is believed to be remote.\n\nShareholder inquiries may be made by writing\nto the Trust, c/o the\nDistributor, State Street Global Advisors\nFunds Distributors, LLC at One Iron Street,\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210.\n\nCOUNSEL AND INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC\nACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 1111 Pennsylvania\nAvenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, serves as\ncounsel to the Trust. Ernst & Young LLP,\nlocated\nat 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, MA 02116,\nserves as the independent registered public\naccounting firm of the Trust. Ernst & Young\nLLP performs annual audits of the Fund\u0092s\nfinancial statements and provides other audit,\ntax and related\nservices.\n\n48\n\nLOCAL MARKET HOLIDAY SCHEDULES\n\nThe Trust generally intends to effect\ndeliveries of portfolio securities on a basis\nof \u0093T\u0094 plus two Business Days (i.e., days on\nwhich the NYSE is\nopen)in the relevant foreign market of the\nFund. The ability of the Trust to effect in-\nkind redemptions within two Business Days of\nreceipt of a redemption request is subject to,\namong other things,\nthe condition that, within the time period\nfrom the date of the request to the date of\ndelivery of the securities, there are no days\nthat are local market holidays on the relevant\nBusiness Days. For every occurrence of one or\nmore intervening\nholidays in the local market that are not\nholidays observed in the United States, the\nredemption settlement cycle may be extended by\nthe number of such intervening local holidays.\nIn addition to holidays, other unforeseeable\nclosings in a foreign\nmarket due to emergencies may also prevent the\nTrust from delivering securities within two\nBusiness Days.\n\nThe securities delivery cycles currently\npracticable for transferring portfolio\nsecurities to redeeming investors, coupled\nwith local market holiday schedules, may\nrequire a delivery process longer than the\nstandard settlement period. In certain\ncircumstances during the calendar year, the\nsettlement period may be greater than seven\ncalendar days. Such periods are listed in the\ntable below, as are instances where more than\nseven days will be needed to deliver\nredemption proceeds. Since certain holidays\nmay occur on different dates in\nsubsequent years, the number of days required\nto deliver redemption proceeds in any given\nyear may exceed the maximum number of days\nlisted in the table below. The proclamation of\nnew holidays, the treatment by market\nparticipants of certain days as\n\u0093informal holidays\u0094 (e.g., days on which no or\nlimited securities transactions occur, as a\nresult of substantially shortened trading\nhours), the elimination of existing holidays,\nor changes in local securities delivery\npractices,\ncould affect the information set forth herein\nat some time in the future and longer (worse)\nredemption periods are possible.\n\nListed below are the dates\nin calendar year 2020 (the only year for which\nholidays are known at the time of this SAI\nfiling) in which the regular holidays in\nnon-U.S. markets may impact Fund settlement.\nThis list is based on information\navailable to the Fund. The list may not be\naccurate or complete and is subject to change:\n                                              \n  Alb\u2026    Arge\u2026    Austr\u2026    Aust\u2026    Bahra\u2026  \n

As a result,    \n  the integration of our engagement           \n  activities, while leveraging the exercise   \n  of our voting rights, provides a            \n  meaningful shareholder tool that we         \n  believe protects and enhances the           \n  long-term economic value of the holdings    \n  in our client accounts. We maximize our     \n  voting power and engagement by maintaining  \n  a centralized proxy                         \n  voting and active ownership process         \n  covering all holdings, regardless of        \n  strategy. Despite the vast investment       \n  strategies and objectives across State      \n  Street Global Advisors, the fiduciary       \n  responsibilities of share ownership and     \n  voting for which                            \n  State Street Global Advisors has voting     \n  discretion are carried out with a single    \n  voice and objective.                        \n  The Principles support governance           \n  structures that we believe add to, or       \n  maximize shareholder value, for the         \n  companies held in our clients\u0092 portfolios.   \n  We conduct issuer specific engagements      \n  with companies to discuss our               \n  principles, including sustainability        \n  related risks. In addition, we encourage    \n  issuers to find ways to increase the        \n  amount of direct communication board        \n  members have with shareholders. Direct      \n  communication with executive board members  \n  and independent                             \n  non-executive directors is critical to      \n  helping companies understand shareholder    \n  concerns. Conversely, we conduct            \n  collaborative engagement activities with    \n  multiple shareholders and communicate with  \n  company                                     \n  representatives about common concerns       \n  where appropriate.                          \n  In conducting our engagements, we also      \n  evaluate the various factors that           \n  influence the corporate governance          \n  framework of a country, including the       \n  macroeconomic conditions and broader        \n  political system, the quality of            \n  regulatory                                  \n  oversight, the enforcement of property and  \n  shareholder rights, and the independence    \n  of the judiciary. We understand that        \n  regulatory requirements and investor        \n  expectations relating to governance         \n  practices and engagement activities differ  \n  from country                                \n  to country. As a result, we engage with     \n  issuers, regulators, or a combination of    \n  the two depending upon the market. We are   \n  also a member of various investor           \n  associations that seek to address broader   \n  corporate governance related policy at the  \n  country                                     \n  level as well as issuer- specific concerns  \n  at a company level.                         \n  The State Street Global Advisors Asset      \n  Stewardship Team may collaborate with       \n  members of the Active Fundamental and       \n  various other investment teams to engage    \n  with companies on corporate governance      \n  issues and to address any specific          \n  concerns. This facilitates our              \n  comprehensive approach to information       \n  gathering as it relates to shareholder      \n  items that are to be voted upon at          \n  upcoming shareholder meetings. We also      \n  conduct issuer-specific engagements with    \n  companies covering various                  \n  corporate governance and sustainability     \n  related topics outside of proxy season.     \n  The Asset Stewardship Team employs a blend  \n  of quantitative and qualitative research,   \n  analysis, and data in order to support      \n  screens that identify issuers where active  \n  engagement may be necessary to protect and  \n  promote shareholder                         \n  value. Issuer engagement may also be event  \n  driven, focusing on issuer-specific         \n  corporate governance, sustainability        \n  concerns, or more broad industry-related    \n  trends. We also consider the size of our    \n  total position of the issuer in question    \n  and/or the                                  \n  potential negative governance, performance  \n  profile, and circumstance at hand. As a     \n  result, we believe issuer engagement can    \n  take many forms and be triggered by         \n  numerous circumstances. The following       \n  approaches represent how we define          \n  engagement                                  \n  methods:                                    \n  Active We use screening tools designed to   \n  capture a mix of company-specific data      \n  including governance and sustainability     \n  profiles to help us focus our voting and    \n  engagement activity. We will actively seek  \n  direct dialogue with                        \n  the board and management of companies that  \n  we have identified through our screening    \n  processes. Such engagements may lead to     \n  further monitoring to ensure that the       \n  company improves its governance or          \n  sustainability practices. In these cases,   \n  the                                         \n  engagement process represents the most      \n  meaningful opportunity for us to protect    \n  long-term shareholder value from excessive  \n  risk due to poor governance and             \n  sustainability practices.                   \n                                              \nB-2\n                                              \n                        Reactive Reactive     \n                        engagement is         \n                        initiated by the      \n                        issuers.

Thus, we may       \n  withhold votes from board chairs and lead   \n  independent directors who sit on more than  \n  three public company boards, and from       \n  non-executive directors who hold more than  \n  four                                        \n  public company board mandates. We may also  \n  take voting action against named executive  \n  officers who undertake more than two        \n  public board memberships. We also consider  \n  attendance at board meetings and may        \n  withhold votes from directors who attend    \n  less                                        \n  than 75% of board meetings without          \n  appropriate explanation or providing        \n  reason for their failure to meet the        \n  attendance threshold. In addition, we       \n  monitor other factors that may influence    \n  the independence of a                       \n  non-executive director, such as             \n  performance-related pay,                    \n  cross-directorships, significant            \n  shareholdings, and tenure. We support the   \n  annual election of directors and            \n  encourages Australian and New Zealand       \n  companies to adopt this practice.           \n  While we are generally supportive of        \n  having the roles of chairman and CEO        \n  separated in the Australian and New         \n  Zealand markets, we assess the division of  \n  responsibilities between chairman and CEO   \n  on a                                        \n  case-by-case basis, giving consideration    \n  to factors such as company-specific         \n  circumstances, overall level of             \n  independence on the board and general       \n  corporate governance                        \n  standards in the company. Similarly, we     \n  will monitor for circumstances in which a   \n  combined chairman/CEO is appointed or       \n  where a former CEO becomes chairman.        \n  We may also consider board performance and  \n  directors who appear to be remiss in the    \n  performance of their oversight              \n  responsibilities when analyzing their       \n  suitability for reappointment (e.g. fraud,  \n  criminal wrongdoing and breach of           \n  fiduciary responsibilities).                \n  We believe companies should have            \n  committees for audit, remuneration, and     \n  nomination oversight. The audit committee   \n  is responsible for monitoring the           \n  integrity of the financial statements of    \n  the company, appointing external auditors,  \n  monitoring their qualifications and         \n  independence, and their effectiveness and   \n  resource levels. ASX Corporate Governance   \n  Principles requires listed companies to     \n  have an audit committee of at least three   \n  members all of whom are non-executive       \n  directors and a majority of whom are        \n  independent directors. It also requires     \n  that the committee be chaired by an         \n  independent director who is not the chair   \n  of the board. We hold Australian and New    \n  Zealand companies to our global standards   \n  for developed financial markets by          \n  requiring that all members of the audit     \n  committee be independent directors.         \n  In our analysis of boards, we consider      \n  whether board members have adequate skills  \n  to provide effective oversight of           \n  corporate strategy, operations, and risks,  \n  including environmental and social issues.  \n  Boards should also have a                   \n  regular evaluation process in place to      \n  assess the effectiveness of the board and   \n  the skills of board members to address      \n  issues, such as emerging risks, changes to  \n  corporate strategy, and diversification of  \n  operations and geographic footprint. The    \n  nomination committee is responsible for     \n  evaluating and reviewing the balance of     \n  skills, knowledge, and experience of the    \n  board. It also ensures that adequate        \n  succession plans are in place for           \n  directors and the CEO.

We may     \n  withhold support for a proposal to          \n  discharge the board if a company fails to   \n  meet adequate governance standards or       \n  board level independence.                   \n  We also assess the division of              \n  responsibilities between chair and CEO on   \n  a case-by-case basis, giving consideration  \n  to factors such as overall level of         \n  independence on the board and general       \n  corporate governance standards in the       \n  company. However, we may take voting        \n  action against the chair or members of the  \n  nominating committee at the STOXX Europe    \n  600 companies that have combined the roles  \n  of chair                                    \n  and CEO and have not appointed an           \n  independent deputy chair or a lead          \n  independent director.                       \n  When voting on the election or re-election  \n  of a director, we also consider the number  \n  of outside board directorships a            \n  non-executive and an executive              \n  may undertake. Thus, we may withhold votes  \n  from board chairs and lead independent      \n  directors who sit on more than three        \n  public company boards, and from             \n  non-executive directors who hold more than  \n  four public                                 \n  company board mandates. We may also take    \n  voting action against named executive       \n  officers who undertake more than two        \n  public board memberships.                   \n  We also consider attendance at board        \n  meetings and may withhold votes from        \n  directors who attend less than 75% of       \n  board meetings without appropriate          \n  explanation or providing reason for their   \n  failure to meet the attendance threshold .  \n  In addition, we monitor other factors that  \n  may influence the independence of a         \n  non-executive director, such as             \n  performance-related pay,                    \n  cross-directorships and significant         \n  shareholdings. Moreover, we may vote        \n  against the election of a director whose    \n  biographical disclosures are insufficient   \n  to assess his or her role on the board      \n  and/or independence.                        \n  Further, we expect boards of STOXX Europe   \n  600 listed companies to have at least one   \n  female board member. If a company fails to  \n  meet this expectation, State Street Global  \n  Advisors may vote against the Chair of the  \n  board\u0092s                                      \n  nominating committee or the board leader    \n  in the absence of a nominating committee,   \n  if necessary.                               \n  Although we generally are in favour of the  \n  annual election of directors, we recognise  \n  that director terms vary considerably in    \n  different European markets. We may vote     \n  against article/bylaw changes that seek to  \n  extend director terms.                      \n  In addition, we may vote against directors  \n  if their terms extend beyond four years in  \n  certain markets.                            \n  We believe companies should have relevant   \n  board level committees for audit,           \n  remuneration and nomination oversight. The  \n  audit committee is responsible for          \n  monitoring the integrity of the financial   \n  statements of the company,                  \n  appointing external auditors, monitoring    \n  their qualifications and independence, and  \n  assessing effectiveness and resource        \n  levels. Similarly, executive pay is an      \n  important aspect of corporate governance,   \n  and it should be determined by the board    \n  of                                          \n  directors. We expect companies to have      \n  remuneration committees to provide          \n  independent oversight of executive pay. We  \n  may vote against nominees who are           \n  executive members of audit or remuneration  \n  committees.                                 \n                                              \nB-30\n                                              \n                        In our analysis of    \n                        boards, we consider   \n                        whether board         \n                        members have          \n                        adequate skills to    \n                        provide effective     \n                        oversight of          \n                        corporate strategy,   \n                        operations, and       \n                        risks,                \n                        including             \n                        environmental and     \n                        social issues.        \n                        Boards should also    \n                        have a regular        \n                        evaluation process    \n                        in place to assess    \n                        the effectiveness of  \n                        the board and the     \n                        skills of board       \n                        members to address    \n                        issues such as        \n                        emerging risks,       \n                        changes to corporate  \n                        strategy, and         \n                        diversification of    \n                        operations and        \n                        geographic            \n                        footprint.            \n                        In certain European   \n                        markets it is not     \n                        uncommon for the      \n                        election of           \n                        directors to be       \n                        presented in a        \n                        single slate.

Statutory auditors attend board    \n  meetings but do not have voting rights at   \n  the board; however, they have the right to  \n  seek an injunction and conduct broad        \n  investigations of unlawful behavior in the  \n  company\u0092s operations.                        \n  State Street Global Advisors will support   \n  the election of statutory auditors, unless  \n  the outside statutory auditor nominee is    \n  regarded as non-independent based on our    \n  criteria, the outside                       \n  statutory auditor has attended less than    \n  75\u00a0percent of meetings of the board of      \n  directors or board of statutory auditors    \n  during the year under review, or the        \n  statutory auditor has been remiss in the    \n  performance of their oversight              \n  responsibilities (fraud, criminal wrong     \n  doing, and breach of fiduciary              \n  responsibilities).                          \n  For companies with a statutory auditor      \n  structure there is no legal requirement     \n  that boards have outside directors;         \n  however, we believe there should be a       \n  transparent process of independent and      \n  external monitoring of management on        \n  behalf of shareholders.                     \n  \u0095\u2003\u200aWe believe that boards of TOPIX 500       \n  companies should have at least three        \n  independent directors or be at least        \n  one-third independent, whichever requires   \n  fewer independent directors. Otherwise, we  \n  may oppose the board leader who is          \n  responsible for the director nomination     \n  process.                                    \n  \u0095\u2003\u200aFor controlled, non-TOPIX 500             \n  companies with a statutory auditor          \n  structure or hybrid structure, we may       \n  oppose the board leader if the board does   \n  not have at least two independent           \n  directors.                                  \n  \u0095 For non-controlled, non-TOPIX 500          \n  companies with                              \n  a statutory auditor structure or hybrid     \n  structure,                                  \n  State Street Global Advisors may oppose     \n  the board                                   \n  leader, if the board does not have at       \n  least two                                   \n  outside directors.                          \n  For companies with a committee structure    \n  or a hybrid board structure, we also take   \n  into consideration the overall              \n  independence level of the committees.

Thus, we may withhold votes      \n  from board chairs and lead independent      \n  directors who sit on more than three        \n  public company boards, and from             \n  non-executive directors who hold more than  \n  four public company board mandates. We may  \n  also take voting action against Named       \n  Executive Officers who undertake more than  \n  two public board                            \n  memberships.                                \n  We also consider attendance at board        \n  meetings and may withhold votes from        \n  directors who attend less than 75% of       \n  board meetings in a given year without      \n  appropriate explanation or providing        \n  reason for their failure to meet the        \n  attendance threshold. In addition, we       \n  monitor other factors that may influence    \n  the independence of a non-executive         \n  director, such as performance-related pay,  \n  cross-directorships and significant         \n  shareholdings.                              \n  We support the annual election of           \n  directors.                                  \n  Further, we expect boards of FTSE 350       \n  listed companies to have at least one       \n  female board member. If a company fails to  \n  meet this expectation, State Street Global  \n  Advisors may vote against the chair of the  \n  board\u0092s nominating                           \n  committee or the board leader in the        \n  absence of a nominating committee, if       \n  necessary. Additionally, if a company       \n  fails to meet this expectation for four     \n  consecutive years, State Street Global      \n  Advisors may vote against all incumbent     \n  members of the                              \n  nominating committee.                       \n  While we are generally supportive of        \n  having the roles of chair and CEO           \n  separated in the UK market, we assess the   \n  division of responsibilities between chair  \n  and CEO on a                                \n  case-by-case basis, giving consideration    \n  to factors such as the company\u0092s specific    \n  circumstances, overall level of             \n  independence on the board and general       \n  corporate                                   \n  governance standards in the company.        \n  Similarly, we monitor for circumstances in  \n  which a combined chair/CEO is appointed or  \n  a former CEO becomes chair.                 \n  We may also consider factors such as board  \n  performance and directors who appear to be  \n  remiss in the performance of their          \n  oversight responsibilities when             \n  considering their suitability for           \n  reappointment (e.g. fraud, criminal         \n  wrongdoing and breach of fiduciary          \n  responsibilities).                          \n  We believe companies should have            \n  committees for audit, remuneration and      \n  nomination oversight. The audit committee   \n  is responsible for monitoring the           \n  integrity of the financial statements of    \n  the company, the appointment of external    \n  auditors, auditor qualifications and        \n  independence, and effectiveness and         \n  resource levels. Similarly, executive pay   \n  is an important aspect of corporate         \n  governance, and it should be determined by  \n  the board of directors. We expect           \n  companies to have                           \n  remuneration committees to provide          \n  independent oversight over executive pay.   \n  We will vote against nominees who are       \n  executive members of audit or remuneration  \n  committees.                                 \n  We consider whether board members have      \n  adequate skills to provide effective        \n  oversight of corporate strategy,            \n  operations and risks, including             \n  environmental and social issues. Boards     \n  should also have a regular evaluation       \n  process in                                  \n  place to assess the effectiveness of the    \n  board and the skills of board members to    \n  address issues such as emerging risks,      \n  changes to corporate strategy, and          \n  diversification of operations and           \n  geographic footprint.

In addition,\nindemnification is permitted only if it is\ndetermined that the actions in question did\nnot render him/her liable by reason of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in\nthe performance of his/her duties or by reason\nof reckless disregard\nof his/her obligations and duties to the\nRegistrant. The Registrant may also advance\nmoney for litigation expenses provided that\nTrustees, officers, employees and/or agents\ngive their undertakings to repay the\nRegistrant unless their conduct is\nlater determined to permit indemnification.\n\nPursuant to Section 5.2 of the Registrant\u0092s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust, no\nTrustee,\nofficer, employee or agent of the Registrant\nshall be liable for any action or failure to\nact, except in the case of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or\nreckless disregard of duties to the\nRegistrant.

In the event that a\nclaim for indemnification against such\nliabilities (other than the payment by the\nRegistrant of expenses incurred or paid by a\ndirector, officer or controlling person of the\nRegistrant in the successful\ndefense of any action, suit or proceeding) is\nasserted by such director, officer or\ncontrolling person in connection with the\nsecurities being registered, the Registrant\nwill, unless in the opinion of its counsel the\nmatter has been settled by\ncontrolling precedent, submit to a court of\nappropriate jurisdiction the question whether\nsuch indemnification by it is against public\npolicy as expressed in the Act and will be\ngoverned by the final adjudication of such\nissue.\n\nThe Registrant hereby undertakes that it will\napply the indemnification provision of its By-\nLaws in a manner\nconsistent with Release 11330 of the SEC under\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the \u00931940 Act\u0094), so long as the\ninterpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i)\nthereunder remains in effect.\n\nThe Registrant maintains insurance on behalf\nof any person who is or was a Trustee,\nofficer, employee or agent of the Registrant,\nor who is or was serving at\nthe request of the Registrant as a trustee,\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of\nanother trust or corporation, against any\nliability asserted against him/her and\nincurred by him/her or arising out of his/her\nposition. However, in no event will\nthe Registrant maintain insurance to indemnify\nany such person for any act for which the\nRegistrant itself is not permitted to\nindemnify him/her.\n\n6\n                                              \n  Item\u00a031.
