Fair value is generally defined as the price the Fund would receive to sell an asset  \nor pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement     \ndate.

Swap agreements are privately\nnegotiated in the OTC market and may be entered into as a bilateral contract (\u201cBL OTC\u201d) or centrally        \ncleared\u00a0(\u201ccentrally cleared swaps\u201d). Swaps are marked-to-market daily and changes in value are recorded as  \nunrealized appreciation (depreciation).                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nA BL OTC swap is a transaction between a fund and dealer counterparty where cash flows are exchanged between\nthe two parties for the life of the swap. For BL OTC swaps, any upfront premiums paid are recorded as assets\nand any upfront fees received are recorded as liabilities and are shown as credit default swap contracts    \npremiums paid and credit default swap contracts premiums received, respectively, in the Statements of Assets\nand Liabilities and amortized to realized gain/loss ratably over the term of the BL OTC swap. Payments      \nreceived or made by the Fund for BL OTC swaps are recorded in the Statements of Operations as realized gains\nor losses,respectively. When a BL OTC swap is terminated, the Fund will record a realized gain or loss equal\nto the difference between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing transaction and the Fund\u2019s basis in the\ncontract, if any. Generally, the basis of the contracts is the premium received or paid.                    \n                                                                                                            \nA centrally cleared OTC swap is a transaction executed between a fund and a dealer counterparty, then       \ncleared by a futures commission merchant (FCM) through a clearinghouse. Once cleared, the clearinghouse     \nserves as a central counterparty (\u201cCCP\u201d), with whom a exchanges cash flows for the life of the transaction, \nsimilar to transactions in futures contracts.                                                               \n                                                                                                            \nThe Fund is required to interface with the CCP through a broker. Upon entering into a centrally cleared     \nswap, the Fund is required to deposit initial margin with the broker in the form of cash or securities in an\namount that varies depending on the size and risk profile of the particular swap. Securities deposited as   \ninitial margin if any, are designated on the Consolidated\u00a0Schedule of Investments and cash deposited is     \nsegregated and recorded on the Consolidated\u00a0Statement of Assets and Liabilities as Net cash at broker. The  \ndaily change in valuation of centrally cleared swaps is recorded as a receivable or payable for variation   \nmargin in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Payments received from (paid\u00a0to) the counterparty,       \nincluding at termination, are recorded as realized gain (loss) in the Statement of Operations. For both bi- \nlateral and centrally cleared OTC swaps, payments are exchanged at specified intervals, accrued daily       \ncommencing with the effective date of the contract and recorded as realized gain or (loss). Some swaps may  \nbe terminated prior to the effective date and realize a gain or loss upon termination.                      \n                                                     9                                                      \nTable of Contents                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nSPDR SERIES TRUST                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nSPDR BLOOMBERG ENHANCED ROLL YIELD COMMODITY STRATEGY NO K-1 ETF                                            \n                                                                                                            \nCONSOLIDATED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nOctober 31, 2024                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Total Return Swaps                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nTotal return swaps are agreements in which there is an exchange of cash flows whereby one party commits to  \nmake payments on the total return (coupon plus capital gains/losses) of an underlying instrument in exchange\nfor fixed or floating rate interest payments.

Such risks involve the   \npossibility that there will be no liquid market for these agreements, that the counterparty to the          \nagreements may default on its obligation to perform or disagree as to the meaning of the contractual terms  \nin the agreements, and that there may be unfavorable changes in interest rates and/or market values         \nassociated with these transactions.                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nDerivative transactions can create investment leverage and may be highly volatile. Use of derivatives other \nthan for hedging purposes may be considered speculative. When a Fund invests in a derivative instrument, the\nfuture exposure is potentially unlimited. The value of a derivative instrument will depend on the ability   \nand the willingness of a Fund\u2019s derivative counterparty to perform its obligations under the transaction. A \nliquid secondary market may not always exist for a Fund's derivative positions at any time and may impact   \nthe Fund's ability to establish fair market value of a derivative transaction and close out derivative      \npositions. Although the use of derivatives is intended to complement a Fund's performance, it may instead   \nreduce returns and increase volatility. The measurement of the risks associated with derivative instruments \nis meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered. A Fund must set aside liquid\nassets or engage in other appropriate measures to cover its obligations under these derivative instruments. \n                                                                                                            \nCertain derivatives, including forward foreign currency contracts and some swap contracts, as applicable,   \nare entered into under the terms and conditions of an ISDA Master Agreement , which are separately          \nnegotiated with each counterparty. An ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral agreement between a Fund and a   \ncounterparty that governs certain OTC derivatives and typically contains, among other things, collateral    \nposting terms and netting provisions in the event of a default and/or termination event. Under an ISDA      \nMaster Agreement, a Fund may, under certain circumstances, offset with the counterparty certain derivative  \nfinancial instruments\u2019 payables and/or receivables with collateral held and/or posted and create one single \nnet payment. The provisions of the ISDA Master Agreement typically permit a single net payment in the event \nof default including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty. Bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a   \nparticular jurisdiction may restrict or prohibit the right of offset in bankruptcy, insolvency or other     \nevents. In addition, certain ISDA Master Agreements allow counterparties to terminate derivative contracts  \nprior to maturity in the event a Fund\u2019s net assets decline by a stated percentage or the Fund fails to meet \nthe terms of its ISDA Master Agreements. The result would cause the Fund to accelerate payment of any net   \nliability owed to the counterparty.                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nFor derivatives traded under an ISDA Master Agreement, the collateral requirements are typically calculated \nby netting the mark-to-market amount for each transaction under such agreement and comparing that amount to \nthe value of any collateral currently pledged by a Fund and the counterparty. Cash collateral that has been \npledged to cover obligations of a Fund and cash collateral received from the counterparty, if any, is       \nreported separately on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities as cash pledged as collateral\u00a0 and\u00a0 cash\u00a0   \nreceived\u00a0 as\u00a0 collateral,\u00a0 respectively.\u00a0 Non-cash collateral pledged or received by a Fund, if any, is     \nnoted in the Fund's Consolidated Schedule of Investments. Notional principal amounts are one component used \nto calculate the amount of exposure to the underlying instrument, but is not the amount delivered under the \ncontract. Accordingly, credit risk is limited to any amounts receivable from the counterparty. To reduce    \ncredit risk from potential counterparty default, a Fund enters into swap contracts with counterparties whose\ncreditworthiness have has been recommended by SSGA FM approved by the Board. The Fund bears the market risk \narising from any change in index or security values or interest rates.                                      \n                                                     10

Risks Market Risk The Fund\u2019s investments are subject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets. Investment markets can be\nvolatile and prices of investments can change substantially due to various factors including, but not\nlimited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness, such as COVID-19, or other\npublic health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments.\nCommodities and Commodity-Linked Derivatives Risk Commodity prices can have significant volatility, and\nexposure to commodities can cause the net asset value of Fund Shares to decline or fluctuate in a rapid and\nunpredictable manner. A liquid secondary market may not exist for certain commodity investments, which may\nmake it difficult for the Fund to sell them at a desirable price or at the price at which it is carrying\nthem. The value of commodities and commodity-linked derivative instruments typically is based upon the price\nmovements of a physical commodity or an economic variable linked to such price movements. Therefore, the\nvalue of commodities and commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by, for example, changes in\noverall market movements, economic conditions, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular\ncommodity or industry,such as production, supply, demand, drought, floods, weather, political, economic and\nregulatory developments. These factors may impair the ability of the Fund to sell its portfolio holdings\nquickly or for full value. Commodity-linked derivatives are subject to the risk that the counterparty to the\ntransaction may default or otherwise fail to perform. Counterparty Risk The Fund will be subject to credit\nrisk with respect to the counterparties with which the Fund enters into derivatives instruments, as well as\nother transactions. If a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, the Fund may be unable to\nterminate or realize any gain on the investment or transaction, or to recover collateral posted to the\ncounterparty, resulting in a loss to the Fund. If the Fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or prevented from realizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding relating to the counterparty.\n\n13\nTable of Contents                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nSPDR SERIES TRUST                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nSPDR BLOOMBERG ENHANCED ROLL YIELD COMMODITY STRATEGY NO K-1 ETF                                            \n                                                                                                            \nCONSOLIDATED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nOctober 31, 2024                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsequent Events                                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \nManagement has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund through the date the financial     \nstatements were issued and has determined that there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment or      \ndisclosure in the financial statements.                                                                     \n                                                     14                                                     \nTable of Contents                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n  SPDR SERIES TRUST                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nTo the Shareholders of SPDR Bloomberg Enhanced Roll Yield Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF and the Board of    \nTrustees of SPDR \u00ae Series Trust                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n   Opinion on the Financial Statements                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of SPDR Bloomberg Enhanced\nRoll Yield Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) (one of the funds constituting SPDR \u00ae Series Trust    \n(the \u201cTrust\u201d)), including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of October 31, 2024, and the related \nconsolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets, and the consolidated financial highlights  \nfor the period from September 5, 2024 (commencement of operations) through October 31, 2024, and the related\nnotes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d).

Our responsibility is to       \nexpress an opinion on the Fund\u2019s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm   \nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to \nbe independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the        \napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.                   \n                                                                                                            \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan  \nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of     \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged\nto perform, an audit of the Trust\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are  \nrequired to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.        \nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial      \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such      \nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the       \nfinancial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2024, by   \ncorrespondence with the custodian, brokers and others; when replies were not received from brokers and      \nothers, we performed other auditing procedures.

(the \u201cAdviser\u201d or \u201cSSGA FM\u201d) with\nrespect to the following series of SST: SPDR Bloomberg Enhanced Roll Yield Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF    \n(the \u201cNew ETF\u201d). The Trustees who are not \u201cinterested persons\u201d of the Trust within the meaning of the       \nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cIndependent Trustees\u201d), also met separately to consider the\nAgreement. The Independent Trustees were advised by their independent legal counsel throughout the process. \n                                                                                                            \nTo evaluate the Advisory Agreement, the Board requested and SSGA FM, the Trust\u2019s adviser and administrator, \nand State Street Bank and Trust Company, the Trust\u2019s sub-administrator, transfer agent and custodian (\u201cState\nStreet\u201d) provided, such materials as the Board, with the advice of counsel, deemed reasonably necessary. In \ndeciding whether to approve the Advisory Agreement, the Board considered various factors, including the     \nnature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser with respect to the SPDR ETFs currently under\nthe Agreement, the proposed cost of those services in relation to the services to be provided and in        \nrelation to fees charged to comparable funds, other benefits to the Adviser of its relationship with each   \nNew ETF, and extent to which economies of scale would be shared as each New ETF grows.                      \n                                                                                                            \n  Nature, Extent and Quality of Services                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board considered the nature, extent and quality of services to be provided by the Adviser. In doing so, \nthe Trustees relied on their prior experience in overseeing the management of the Trusts and the materials  \nprovided prior to and at the meeting. The Board reviewed the Advisory Agreements and the Adviser\u2019s          \nresponsibilities for managing investment operations of the New ETF in accordance with the New ETF\u2019s         \ninvestment objectives and policies, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The Board appreciated \nthe nature of the New ETF as an exchange-traded fund and the experience and expertise of the Adviser in     \nmanaging exchange-traded funds. The Board considered the background and experience of the Adviser\u2019s senior  \nmanagement, including those individuals responsible for portfolio management, and regulatory compliance of  \nthe New ETF. The Board also considered the portfolio management resources, structures and practices of the  \nAdviser, including those associated with monitoring and ensuring the New ETF\u2019s compliance with its          \ninvestment objectives and policies, and applicable laws and regulations. The Board further considered       \ninformation about the Adviser\u2019s best execution procedures and overall investment management business, noting\nthat the Adviser serves a wide range of clients across a broad spectrum of asset classes. The Board looked  \nat the Adviser\u2019s general knowledge of the investment management business and that of its affiliates which   \nmake up State Street Global Advisors, through which the Adviser shares all of its senior personnel. The     \nBoard specifically considered the Adviser\u2019s experience in managing equity and fixed income exchange-traded  \nfunds with index-based investment objectives, as well as actively-managed exchange-traded funds.            \n                                                                                                            \n  Fees Charged to Comparable Funds                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board evaluated the New ETF\u2019s proposed unitary fee through review of comparative information with       \nrespect to fees paid by similar funds\u2013 i.e., exchange-traded funds tracking similar commodity or equity     \nincome indexes with respect to the SPDR Bloomberg Enhanced Roll Yield Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF. The    \nBoard reviewed the universe of similar exchange-traded funds for the New ETF based upon data independently  \nobtained from Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. and related comparative information for similar exchange-\ntraded funds. In certain instances as considered appropriate by the Board, the Board explored with          \nmanagement the reasons for the differences between the New ETF\u2019s fee and fees paid by similar funds.        \n                                                                                                            \n  Other Benefits                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board also considered whether the Adviser or its affiliates benefited in other ways from its            \nrelationship with the Trusts, noting that the Adviser does not currently maintain soft-dollar arrangements  \nin connection with the Trusts\u2019 brokerage transactions.                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n  Economies of Scale                                                                                        \n                                                                                                            \nThe Board reviewed information regarding economies of scale or other efficiencies that may result as the New\nETF\u2019s assets grow in size. The Board noted that the advisory fee rate for the New ETF does not provide for  \nbreakpoints as assets of the New ETF increase. However, the Board further noted the Adviser\u2019s assertion that\nfuture economies of scale (among several factors) had been taken into consideration for the\u00a0 New ETF by     \nfixing a relatively low advisory fees, effectively sharing the benefits of lower fees with the New ETF from \nthe time of its inception. The Adviser also asserted that one of the benefits of the unitary fee was to     \nprovide an unvarying                                                                                        \n                                                     17                                                     \nTable of Contents                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nSPDR Series Trust                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \nStatement Regarding Basis for Approval of Investment Advisory Contract (continued)                          \n                                                                                                            \nOctober 31, 2024 (Unaudited)                                                                                \n                                                                                                            \nexpense structure, which could be lost or diluted with the addition of breakpoints.

In approving the Advisory Agreement, the Board, including the           \nIndependent Trustees voting separately, found that the terms of the Advisory Agreement are fair and         \nreasonable and that the approval of the Advisory Agreement is in the best interests of the New ETF and their\nshareholders. The Board\u2019s conclusions with respect to the factors were as follows: (a) the nature, extent   \nand quality of the services expected to be provided by the Adviser with respect to the New ETF were         \nappropriate; (b) the Adviser\u2019s unitary fee for the New ETF, considered in relation to the services expected \nto be provided, and in relation to the fees charged to comparable funds, was reasonable; and (c) any        \nadditional potential benefits to the Adviser or its affiliates were not of a magnitude to materially affect \nthe Board\u2019s conclusions. The Independent Trustees were advised by their independent counsel throughout the  \nprocess.                                                                                                    \n                                                     18                                                     \n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                                                                                          \u2502\n\u2502  Item\u20098.
