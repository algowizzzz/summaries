The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n              \n  Year  Year  \n  1        3  \n  $14    $44  \n              \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. The Fund had not commenced\noperations as of the date of this Prospectus\nand, as a result, does not yet have a\nportfolio turnover rate. The Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In seeking to track the\nperformance of the Bloomberg Barclays 3-12\nMonth U.S. Treasury Bill Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a sampling strategy, which\nmeans that the Fund is not required to\npurchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nBased on its analysis of these factors, SSGA\nFunds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking\n\n1\nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nto track the Index, the Fund may invest in    \ndebt securities that are not                  \nincluded in the Index, cash and cash          \nequivalents or money market instruments, such \nas repurchase agreements and money market     \nfunds (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser).                                 \n                                              \nThe Index is designed to measure the          \nperformance of public                         \nobligations of the U.S. Treasury that have a  \nremaining maturity of greater than or equal to\n3 months and less than 12 months. The Index   \nincludes all publicly issued U.S. Treasury    \nBills that have a remaining maturity of less  \nthan 12 months and at                         \nleast 3 months, and are rated investment-     \ngrade. In addition, the securities must be    \ndenominated in U.S. dollars and must have a   \nfixed rate. The Index is market capitalization\nweighted, with securities held in the Federal \nReserve System Open Market                    \nAccount deducted from the total amount        \noutstanding. Securities in the Index are      \nreconstituted and rebalanced on the last      \nbusiness day of each month. As of August 31,  \n2020, there were approximately 20 securities  \nin the Index.                                 \n                                              \nThe Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index     \nServices                                      \nLimited\u00a0(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not  \naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The  \nIndex Provider determines the composition of  \nthe Index, relative weightings of the         \nsecurities in the Index and publishes         \ninformation regarding                         \nthe market value of the Index.                \n                                              \n  Principal Risks of                          \n  Investing in the Fund                       \n                                              \nAs with all investments, there are certain    \nrisks                                         \nof investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will    \nchange in value, and you could lose money by  \ninvesting in the Fund. An investment in the   \nFund is not insured or guaranteed by the      \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any  \nother government agency.                      \n                                              \nMarket                                        \nRisk: The Fund's investments are subject to   \nchanges in general economic conditions,       \ngeneral market fluctuations and the risks     \ninherent in investment in securities markets. \nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices \nof investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in      \ninterest rates, changes in the actual or      \nperceived creditworthiness of issuers, and    \ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject \nto the risk that geopolitical events will     \ndisrupt securities markets and adversely      \naffect global economies and markets. Local,   \nregional or global events such as war, acts of\nterrorism, the spread of infectious illness or\nother public health issues, or other events   \ncould have a significant impact on the Fund   \nand its investments.                          \n                                              \nDebt Securities Risk: The values of debt      \nsecurities may increase or decrease as a      \nresult of the following: market fluctuations, \nincreases in interest rates, actual or        \nperceived inability or unwillingness of       \nissuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to \nmake scheduled principal or interest payments \nor illiquidity in debt securities markets; the\nrisk of low rates of return due to            \nreinvestment of securities during periods of  \nfalling interest rates or repayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or interest rates; and/or  \nthe risk of low income due to falling interest\nrates. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally          \nanticipated and the value of those securities \nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate      \nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's \nfixed income securities to decrease, an       \nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's \nfixed income securities, and increased        \nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The   \ncurrent historically low interest rate        \nenvironment heightens the risks associated    \nwith rising interest rates. During periods    \nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the    \nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on  \nan operating basis). If the principal on a    \ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,   \nthe prepayments of principal may have to be   \nreinvested in obligations paying interest at  \nlower rates. During periods of falling        \ninterest rates, the income received by the    \nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates   \nwill likely have a greater effect on the      \nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities     \ncould trail the returns on other investment   \noptions, including investments in equity      \nsecurities.                                   \n                                              \nU.S. Treasury Obligations Risk: U.S. Treasury \nobligations may differ from other fixed income\nsecurities in their interest rates,           \nmaturities, times of issuance and other       \ncharacteristics. Similar to other issuers,    \nchanges to the financial condition or credit  \nrating of the U.S. government may cause the   \nvalue of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations \nto decline.                                   \n                                              \nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share         \nPremiums and Discounts Risk: As with all      \nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be     \nbought and sold in the secondary market at    \nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund     \nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of   \nthe shares is more than the net asset value   \nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is      \nheightened in times of market volatility or   \nperiods of steep market declines.             \n                      2                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nIncome                                        \nRisk: The Fund's income may decline due to    \nfalling interest rates or other factors.      \nIssuers of securities held by the Fund may    \ncall or redeem the securities during periods  \nof falling interest rates, and the Fund would \nlikely be required to reinvest in securities  \npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation \nheld by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other           \nobligations paying income at lower rates.     \n                                              \nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The    \nFund is managed with an indexing investment   \nstrategy, attempting to track the performance \nof an unmanaged index of securities,          \nregardless of the current or projected        \nperformance of the Index or of the actual     \nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs \nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a   \nresult, the Fund's performance may be less    \nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed    \nusing an active investment strategy. The      \nstructure and composition of the Index will   \naffect the performance, volatility, and risk  \nof the Index and, consequently, the           \nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nWhen there are changes made to the component  \nsecurities of the Index and the Fund in turn  \nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any   \ntransaction costs and market exposure arising \nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne     \ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of       \nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities  \nholdings to reflect changes in the securities \nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be   \nrequired to distribute any such gains to its  \nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income  \ntax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to  \ntrack the performance of the Index ( i.e. ,   \nachieve a high degree of correlation with the \nIndex), the Fund's return may not match the   \nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number \nof operating expenses not applicable to the   \nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling \nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be  \nfully invested at times, generally as a result\nof cash flows into or out of the Fund or      \nreserves of cash held by the Fund to meet     \nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to       \nreplicate the Index return by investing in    \nfewer than all of the securities in the Index,\nor in some securities not included in the     \nIndex, potentially increasing the risk of     \ndivergence between the Fund's return and that \nof the Index.                                 \n                                              \nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market or     \nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability  \nof the Fund to sell a security at an          \nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\nsecurities may trade at a discount from       \ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value. \nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may limit  \nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet\nredemptions on a timely basis. In addition,   \nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in\nany illiquid securities and/or the difficulty \nin purchasing and selling such investments,   \nmay be unable to achieve its desired level of \nexposure to a certain market or sector.       \n                                              \nLow Short-Term Interest Rates Risk: During    \nmarket conditions in which short-term interest\nrates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can \nbe very low, and the Fund may have a negative \nyield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). During these conditions, it is        \npossible that the Fund will generate an       \ninsufficient amount of income to pay its      \nexpenses, and will not be able to pay its     \nscheduled dividend. In addition, it is        \npossible that during these conditions the Fund\nmay experience difficulties purchasing and/or \nselling securities with respect to scheduled  \nrebalances, and may, as a result, maintain a  \nportion of its assets in cash, on which it may\nearn little, if any, income. Such market      \nconditions may adversely affect the Fund's    \nability to achieve a high degree of           \ncorrelation with the Index.                   \n                                              \nNew Fund Risk: The Fund is new and there is no\nassurance that the Fund will grow quickly.    \nWhen the Fund's size is small, the Fund may   \nexperience low trading volume, which could    \nlead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition,   \nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted  \nif the Fund does not meet certain conditions  \nof the listing exchange. Any resulting        \nliquidation of the Fund could cause elevated  \ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative   \ntax consequences for its shareholders.        \n                                              \nSecurities Lending                            \nRisk: The Fund may engage in securities       \nlending. Securities lending involves the risk \nthat the borrower of the loaned securities    \nfails to return the securities in a timely    \nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose    \nmoney due to a decline in the value of        \ncollateral provided for loaned securities or  \nany investments made with cash collateral.    \nThese events could also trigger adverse tax   \nconsequences for the Fund. To the extent the  \ncollateral provided or investments made with  \ncash collateral differ from securities        \nincluded in the Index, such collateral or     \ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss   \nthan the securities included in the Index.    \n                                              \nValuation Risk: Some portfolio holdings,      \npotentially a large portion of the Fund's     \ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the    \nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market  \nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are       \nmultiple methods that can be used to value a  \nportfolio holding when market quotations are  \nnot readily available. The value established  \nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time  \nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been     \npriced using market quotations. Portfolio     \nholdings that are valued using techniques     \nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair \nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater \nfluctuation in their valuations from one day  \nto the next than if market quotations were    \nused. In addition, there is no assurance that \nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio  \nposition for the value                        \n                      3                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nestablished for it at any time, and it is     \npossible that                                 \nthe Fund would incur a loss because a         \nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a \ndiscount to the valuation established by the  \nFund at that time.                            \n                                              \n  Fund Performance                            \n                                              \nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of   \nthe date of this Prospectus.

Please see \u201cThe Fund's Principal    \nInvestment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund      \nSummary\u201d above for a complete discussion of   \nthe Fund's principal investment strategies.   \nThe Fund may invest in various types of       \nsecurities and engage in various investment   \ntechniques which are not the principal focus  \nof the Fund and therefore are not described in\nthis Prospectus. These securities, techniques \nand practices, together with their risks, are \ndescribed in the Statement of Additional      \nInformation (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain \nfree of charge by contacting shareholder      \nservices (see the back cover of this          \nProspectus for the address and phone number). \n                                              \nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance    \nof\u00a0the Fund's                                 \nIndex as closely as possible (i.e ., obtain a \nhigh degree of correlation with the Index). A \nnumber of factors may affect\u00a0the Fund's       \nability to achieve a high degree of           \ncorrelation with its Index, and there         \ncan be no guarantee that\u00a0the Fund will achieve\na high degree of correlation.\u00a0For example,\u00a0the\nFund may not be able to achieve a high degree \nof correlation with its Index when there are  \npractical difficulties or substantial costs   \ninvolved in compiling a portfolio of          \nsecurities to follow the Index, when a        \nsecurity in the Index becomes temporarily     \nilliquid, unavailable or less liquid, or legal\nrestrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from\ninvesting in a security in the                \nIndex.                                        \n                                              \nThe Adviser will utilize a sampling strategy  \nin                                            \nmanaging the Fund. Sampling means that the    \nAdviser uses quantitative analysis to select  \nsecurities, including securities in the Index,\noutside of the Index and derivatives that have\na similar investment profile as the Index in  \nterms of key risk                             \nfactors, performance attributes and other     \neconomic characteristics. These include       \nindustry weightings, market capitalization,   \nand other financial characteristics of        \nsecurities. The quantity of holdings in the   \nFund will be based on a number of             \nfactors, including asset size of the Fund. In \naddition, from time to time, securities are   \nadded to or removed from the Index. The       \nAdviser may sell securities that are          \nrepresented in the Index, or purchase         \nsecurities that are not yet represented in    \nthe Index, in anticipation of their removal   \nfrom or addition to the Index. Further, the   \nAdviser may choose to overweight securities in\nthe Index, purchase or sell securities not in \nthe Index, or utilize various combinations of \nother available                               \ntechniques, in seeking to track the Index.    \n                                              \nThe Fund has                                  \nadopted a non-fundamental investment policy to\ninvest at least 80% of its net assets, plus   \nthe amount of borrowings for investment       \npurposes, in investments suggested by its     \nname, measured at the time of investment. The \nFund will provide shareholders                \nwith at least 60 days' notice prior to any    \nchange in this non-fundamental 80% investment \npolicy.\u00a0The Board of Trustees of the Trust    \n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change the Fund's investment\nstrategy, Index and other policies without    \nshareholder approval, except as otherwise     \nindicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI.   \nThe Board may also change the Fund's          \ninvestment objective without shareholder      \napproval.                                     \n                                              \n  Non-Principal Strategies                    \n                                              \nCertain Other Investments . The Fund may      \ninvest in structured notes (notes on which the\namount of principal repayment and interest    \npayments are based on the movement of one or  \nmore specified factors such as the movement of\na particular security or index), swaps,       \noptions and futures contracts. Swaps, options \nand futures contracts and structured notes may\nbe used by the Fund in seeking performance    \nthat corresponds to its Index and in managing \ncash flows.                                   \n                                              \nTemporary Defensive                           \nPositions . In certain situations or market   \nconditions, the Fund may temporarily depart   \nfrom its normal investment policies and       \nstrategies, provided that the alternative is  \nconsistent with the Fund's investment         \nobjective and is in the best interest of the  \nFund. For example, the Fund may make larger   \nthan normal investments in derivatives to     \nmaintain exposure to its Index if it is unable\nto invest directly in a component security.   \n                                              \nBorrowing Money . The Fund may borrow money   \nfrom a bank as permitted by the Investment    \nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), \nor other governing statute, by the Rules      \nthereunder, or by the U.S. Securities and     \nExchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other          \nregulatory agency with authority over the     \nFund, but only for temporary or emergency     \npurposes. The Fund may also invest in reverse \nrepurchase agreements, which are considered   \nborrowings under the 1940 Act. Although the   \n1940 Act presently allows the Fund to borrow  \nfrom any bank (including pledging, mortgaging \nor hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33\n1/ 3% of its total assets (not including      \ntemporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of   \nits total assets), and there is no percentage \nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in      \nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nunder normal circumstances any borrowings by  \nthe Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's    \ntotal assets.                                 \n                      5                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nLending of Securities . The Fund may lend its \nportfolio securities in an amount not to      \nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets via \na securities lending program through its      \nsecurities lending agent, State Street Bank   \nand Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d or the      \n\u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers, dealers and     \nother financial institutions desiring to      \nborrow securities to complete transactions and\nfor other purposes. A securities lending      \nprogram allows the Fund to receive a portion  \nof the income generated by lending its        \nsecurities and investing the respective       \ncollateral. The Fund will receive collateral  \nfor each loaned security which is at least    \nequal to the market value of that security,   \nmarked to market each trading day. In the     \nsecurities lending program, the borrower      \ngenerally has the right to vote the loaned    \nsecurities; however, the Fund may call loans  \nto vote proxies if a material issue affecting \nthe Fund's economic interest in the investment\nis to be voted upon. Security loans may be    \nterminated at any time by the Fund.           \n                                              \nAdditional Risk Information                   \n                                              \nThe following section provides information    \nregarding the principal risks                 \nidentified under \u201cPrincipal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund\u201d in the Fund Summary along with   \nadditional risk information.                  \n                                              \n  Principal Risks                             \n                                              \nCredit Risk . Credit risk is the risk that an \nissuer, guarantor or liquidity provider of a  \nfixed-income security held by the Fund may be \nunable or unwilling, or may be perceived      \n(whether by market participants, ratings      \nagencies, pricing services or otherwise) as   \nunable or unwilling, to make timely principal \nand/or interest payments, or to otherwise     \nhonor its obligations. It includes the risk   \nthat the security will be downgraded by a     \ncredit rating agency; generally, lower credit \nquality issuers present higher credit risks.  \nAn actual or perceived decline in             \ncreditworthiness of an issuer of a fixed-     \nincome security held by the Fund may result in\na decrease in the value of the security. It is\npossible that the ability of an issuer to meet\nits obligations will decline substantially    \nduring the period when the Fund owns          \nsecurities of the issuer or that the issuer   \nwill default on its obligations or that the   \nobligations of the issuer will be limited or  \nrestructured.                                 \n                                              \nThe credit rating assigned to any particular  \ninvestment does                               \nnot necessarily reflect the issuer's current  \nfinancial condition and does not reflect an   \nassessment of an investment's volatility or   \nliquidity. Securities rated in the lowest     \ncategory of investment-grade are considered to\nhave speculative                              \ncharacteristics. If a security held by the    \nFund loses its rating or its rating is        \ndowngraded, the Fund may nonetheless continue \nto hold the security in the discretion of the \nAdviser. In the case of asset-backed or       \nmortgage-related securities,                  \nchanges in the actual or perceived ability of \nthe obligors on the underlying assets or      \nmortgages to make payments of interest and/or \nprincipal may affect the values of those      \nsecurities.                                   \n                                              \nDebt Securities Risk . The values of debt     \nsecurities may increase or decrease as a      \nresult of the following: market fluctuations, \nincreases in interest rates, actual or        \nperceived inability or unwillingness of       \nissuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to \nmake scheduled principal or interest payments \nor illiquidity in debt securities markets; the\nrisk of low rates of return due to            \nreinvestment of securities during periods of  \nfalling interest rates or repayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or interest rates; and/or  \nthe risk of low income due to falling interest\nrates. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally          \nanticipated and the value of those securities \nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate      \nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's \nfixed income securities to decrease, a decline\nin the Fund's income and yield, an adverse    \nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed   \nincome securities, and increased volatility of\nthe fixed income markets. The current         \nhistorically low interest rate environment    \nheightens the risks associated with rising    \ninterest rates. During periods when interest  \nrates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can \nbe low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating      \nbasis). If the principal on a debt obligation \nis prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in        \nobligations paying interest at lower rates.   \nDuring periods of falling interest rates, the \nincome received by the Fund may decline.      \nChanges in interest rates will likely have a  \ngreater effect on the values of debt          \nsecurities of longer durations. Returns on    \ninvestments in debt securities could trail the\nreturns on other investment options, including\ninvestments in equity securities.             \n                                              \nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts                                 \nRisk . The net asset value of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate with changes in the market\nvalue of the Fund's securities holdings. The  \nmarket prices of Fund Shares will generally   \nfluctuate in accordance with changes in the   \nFund's net asset value and supply and demand  \nof Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be  \npredicted whether Fund Shares will trade      \nbelow, at or above their net asset value.     \nPrice differences may be due, in large part,  \nto the fact that supply and demand forces at  \nwork in the secondary trading market for Fund \nShares will be closely related to, but not    \nidentical to, the same forces influencing     \n                      6                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nthe prices of the securities\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Index     \ntrading individually                          \nor in the aggregate at any point in time. The \nmarket prices of Fund Shares may deviate      \nsignificantly from the net asset value of Fund\nShares during periods of market volatility.   \nHowever, given that Fund Shares can be created\nand redeemed in Creation                      \nUnits (unlike shares of many closed-end funds,\nwhich frequently trade at appreciable         \ndiscounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, \ntheir net asset value), the Adviser believes  \nthat large discounts or premiums to the net   \nasset value of Fund Shares                    \nshould not be sustained over long periods.    \nWhile the creation/redemption feature is      \ndesigned to make it likely that Fund Shares   \nnormally will trade close to the Fund's net   \nasset value, disruptions to creations and     \nredemptions or market volatility              \nmay result in trading prices that differ      \nsignificantly from the Fund's net asset value.\nIf an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to the  \nnet asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a  \ntime when the market                          \nprice is at a discount to the net asset value \nof Fund Shares, then the investor may sustain \nlosses.                                       \n                                              \nIncome Risk. The Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors.   \nIssuers of securities held by the Fund may    \ncall or redeem the securities during periods  \nof falling interest rates, and the Fund would \nlikely be required to reinvest in securities  \npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation \nheld by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other           \nobligations paying income at lower rates. A   \nreduction in the income earned by the Fund may\nlimit the Fund's ability to achieve its       \nobjective.                                    \n                                              \nIndexing Strategy/Index                       \nTracking Risk . The Fund is managed with an   \nindexing investment strategy, attempting to   \ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities. The Fund will seek to replicate   \nIndex returns, regardless of the current or   \nprojected performance of the Index or of the  \nactual securities comprising the Index. This  \ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which  \ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark     \nindex. The Fund generally will buy and will   \nnot sell a security included in the Index as  \nlong as the security is part of the Index     \nregardless of any sudden or material decline  \nin value or foreseeable material decline in   \nvalue of the security, even though the Adviser\nmay make a different investment decision for  \nother actively managed accounts or portfolios \nthat hold the security. As a result, the      \nFund's performance may be less favorable than \nthat of a portfolio managed using an active   \ninvestment strategy. The structure and        \ncomposition of the Index will affect the      \nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index\n(in absolute terms and by comparison with     \nother indices) and, consequently, the         \nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or   \nthe construction of the Index in accordance   \nwith its methodology may occur from time to   \ntime and may not be identified and corrected  \nby the Index Provider for a period of time or \nat all, which may have an adverse impact on   \nthe Fund and its shareholders. While the      \nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the \nIndex (i.e., achieve a high degree of         \ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index for a   \nnumber of reasons. For example, the return on \nthe sample of securities purchased by the Fund\n(or the return on securities not included in  \nthe Index) to replicate the performance of the\nIndex may not correlate precisely with the    \nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number \nof operating expenses not applicable to the   \nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling \nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be  \nfully invested at times, either as a result of\ncash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves\nof cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. \nThe Adviser may attempt to replicate the Index\nreturn by investing in fewer than all of the  \nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially        \nincreasing the risk of divergence between the \nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes  \nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact the Fund's       \nability to match the return of the Index. The \nAdviser may apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or    \ninvestment techniques to refine or limit the  \nnumber or types of issuers included in the    \nIndex in which the Fund may invest.           \nApplication of such screens or techniques may \nresult in investment performance below that of\nthe Index and may not produce results expected\nby the Adviser. Index tracking risk may be    \nheightened during times of increased market   \nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\n                                              \nPursuant to\u00a0the Index methodology, a security \nmay be                                        \nremoved from\u00a0the Index in the event that it   \ndoes not comply with the eligibility          \nrequirements of the Index. As a result,\u00a0the   \nFund may be forced to sell securities at      \ninopportune times and/or unfavorable prices   \ndue to these changes in the                   \nIndex components. When there are changes made \nto the component securities of\u00a0the Index and  \nthe\u00a0Fund in turn makes similar changes to its \nportfolio to attempt to increase the          \ncorrelation between the Fund's portfolio and  \nthe Index, any                                \ntransaction costs and market exposure arising \nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne     \ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders.    \nUnscheduled changes to\u00a0the Index may expose   \nthe\u00a0Fund to additional tracking error         \nrisk.\u00a0The Fund may                            \nrecognize gains as a result of rebalancing or \nreconstituting its securities holdings to     \nreflect changes in the securities included in \nthe Index. The Fund also may be required to   \ndistribute any such gains to its shareholders \nto avoid adverse federal                      \nincome tax consequences.                      \n                      7                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nInterest Rate Risk . Interest rate risk is the\nrisk that the securities held by the Fund will\ndecline in value because of increases in      \nmarket interest rates. Duration is a measure  \nused to determine the sensitivity of a        \nsecurity's price to changes in interest rates.\nDebt securities with longer durations tend to \nbe more sensitive to changes in interest      \nrates, usually making them more volatile than \ndebt securities with shorter durations. For   \nexample, the value of a security with a       \nduration of five years would be expected to   \ndecrease by 5% for every 1% increase in       \ninterest rates. Falling interest rates also   \ncreate the potential for a decline in the     \nFund's income and yield. Interest-only and    \nprincipal-only securities are especially      \nsensitive to interest rate changes, which can \naffect not only their prices but can also     \nchange the income flows and repayment         \nassumptions about those investments. Variable \nand floating rate securities also generally   \nincrease or decrease in value in response to  \nchanges in interest rates, although generally \nto a lesser degree than fixed-rate securities.\nA substantial increase in interest rates may  \nalso have an adverse impact on the liquidity  \nof a security, especially those with longer   \ndurations. Interest rate changes can be sudden\nand unpredictable, and are influenced by a    \nnumber of factors, including government       \npolicy, monetary policy, inflation            \nexpectations, perceptions of risk, and supply \nand demand for bonds. Changes in government or\ncentral bank policy, including changes in tax \npolicy or changes in a central bank's         \nimplementation of specific policy goals, may  \nhave a substantial impact on interest rates.  \nThis could lead to heightened levels of       \ninterest rate, volatility and liquidity risks \nfor the fixed income markets generally and    \ncould have a substantial and immediate effect \non the values of the Fund's investments. There\ncan be no guarantee that any particular       \ngovernment or central bank policy will be     \ncontinued, discontinued or changed, nor that  \nany such policy will have the desired effect  \non interest rates.                            \n                                              \nLiquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk   \nthat the Fund may not be able to dispose of   \nsecurities or close out derivatives           \ntransactions readily at a favorable time or   \nprices (or at all) or at prices approximating \nthose at which the Fund currently values them.\nFor example, certain investments may be       \nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade  \nin the over-the-counter market or in limited  \nvolume, or may not have an active trading     \nmarket. Illiquid securities may trade at a    \ndiscount from comparable, more liquid         \ninvestments and may be subject to wide        \nfluctuations in market value. It may be       \ndifficult for the Fund to value illiquid      \nsecurities accurately. The market for certain \ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse \nmarket or economic conditions independent of  \nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. Disposal of illiquid  \nsecurities may entail registration expenses   \nand other transaction costs that are higher   \nthan those for liquid securities. The Fund may\nseek to borrow money to meet its obligations  \n(including among other things redemption      \nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of    \nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing  \nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund. \n                                              \nLow Short-Term Interest Rates Risk . During   \nmarket conditions in which short-term interest\nrates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can \nbe very low, and the Fund may have a negative \nyield ( i.e. , it may lose money on an        \noperating basis). During these conditions, it \nis possible that the Fund will generate an    \ninsufficient amount of income to pay its      \nexpenses, and will not be able to pay its     \nscheduled dividend. In addition, it is        \npossible that during these conditions the Fund\nmay experience difficulties purchasing and/or \nselling securities with respect to scheduled  \nrebalances, and may, as a result, maintain a  \nportion of its assets in cash, on which it may\nearn little, if any, income. Such market      \nconditions may adversely affect the Fund's    \nability to achieve a high degree of           \ncorrelation with its Index.                   \n                                              \nMarket Risk . Market prices of investments    \nheld by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes\nrapidly or unpredictably. The Fund's          \ninvestments are subject to changes in general \neconomic conditions, general market           \nfluctuations and the risks inherent in        \ninvestment in securities markets. Investment  \nmarkets can be volatile, and prices of        \ninvestments can change substantially due to   \nvarious factors including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in      \ninterest rates, changes in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in  \nthe Fund could decline if the particular      \nindustries, sectors or companies in which the \nFund invests do not perform well or are       \nadversely affected by events. Further, legal, \npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities  \nprices. Local, regional or global events such \nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of      \ninfectious illness or other public health     \nissues, or other events could have a          \nsignificant impact on the Fund and its        \ninvestments.                                  \n                                              \nAn outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by\na novel                                       \ncoronavirus (known as COVID-19) first detected\nin China in December 2019 has resulted in a   \nglobal pandemic and major disruptions to      \neconomies and markets around the world,       \nincluding the United States. Financial markets\nhave experienced extreme                      \nvolatility and severe losses, and trading in  \nmany instruments has been disrupted. Liquidity\nfor many instruments has been greatly reduced \nfor periods of time. Some interest rates are  \nvery low and in some cases yields are         \nnegative. Governments and                     \ncentral banks, including the Federal Reserve  \nin the United States, have taken extraordinary\nand unprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal                                        \n                      8                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \neconomies and the financial markets. The      \nimpact of these measures, and                 \nwhether they will be effective to mitigate the\neconomic and market disruption, will not be   \nknown for some time. In addition, the outbreak\nof COVID-19, and measures taken to mitigate   \nits effects, could result in disruptions to   \nthe services provided                         \nto the Fund by its service providers.         \n                                              \nNew Fund Risk . The Fund is new and there is  \nno assurance that the Fund will grow quickly. \nWhen the Fund's size is small, the Fund may   \nexperience low trading volume, which could    \nlead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition,   \nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted  \nif the Fund does not meet certain conditions  \nof the listing exchange. Any resulting        \nliquidation of the Fund could cause elevated  \ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative   \ntax consequences for its shareholders.        \n                                              \nReinvestment Risk. Income from the Fund's     \nportfolio may decline when the Fund invests   \nthe proceeds from investment income, sales of \nportfolio securities or matured, traded or    \ncalled debt obligations. For instance, during \nperiods of declining interest rates, an issuer\nof debt obligations may exercise an option to \nredeem securities prior to maturity, forcing  \nthe Fund to reinvest the proceeds in lower-   \nyielding securities. A decline in income      \nreceived by the Fund from its investments is  \nlikely to have a negative effect on the yield \nand total return of the Fund Shares.          \n                                              \nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend    \nportfolio securities in an amount not to      \nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the  \nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any \ntime. Any such loans must be continuously     \nsecured by collateral maintained on a current \nbasis in an amount at least equal to the      \nmarket value of the securities loaned by the  \nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a \nloan transaction, as compensation for lending \nits securities, the Fund will receive a       \nportion of the dividends or interest accrued  \non the securities held as collateral or, in   \nthe case of cash collateral, a portion of the \nincome from the investment of such cash. In   \naddition, the Fund will receive the amount of \nall dividends, interest and other             \ndistributions on the loaned securities.       \nHowever, the borrower has the right to vote   \nthe loaned securities. The Fund will call     \nloans to vote proxies if a material issue     \naffecting the investment is to be voted upon. \nEfforts to recall such securities promptly may\nbe unsuccessful, especially for foreign       \nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and   \nmay involve expenses to the Fund. Securities  \nlending involves the risk that the Fund may   \nlose money because the borrower of the loaned \nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. Should the borrower  \nof the securities fail financially, the Fund  \nmay experience delays in recovering the       \nsecurities or exercising its rights in the    \ncollateral. Loans are made only to borrowers  \nthat are deemed by the securities lending     \nagent to be of good financial standing. In a  \nloan transaction, the Fund will also bear the \nrisk of any decline in value of securities    \nprovided as collateral or acquired with cash  \ncollateral. The Fund will attempt to minimize \nthis risk by limiting the investment of cash  \ncollateral to high quality instruments of     \nshort maturity either directly on behalf of   \nthe lending Fund or through one or more joint \naccounts or funds, which may include those    \nmanaged by the Adviser. To the extent the     \ncollateral provided or investments made with  \ncash collateral differ from securities        \nincluded in the Index, such collateral or     \ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss   \nthan the securities included in the Index. In \naddition, the Fund will be subject to the risk\nthat any income generated by lending its      \nsecurities or reinvesting cash collateral is  \nlower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay\na borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute  \npayments for dividends when overseeing the    \nFund's securities lending activity.           \n                                              \nU.S. Treasury Obligations                     \nRisk . U.S. Treasury obligations may differ   \nfrom other fixed income securities in their   \ninterest rates, maturities, times of issuance \nand other characteristics. Similar to other   \nissuers, changes to the financial condition or\ncredit rating of the U.S. government may cause\nthe value of the Fund\u2018s U.S. Treasury         \nobligations to decline. The total public debt \nof the United States as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product has grown rapidly since the  \nbeginning of the recent financial downturn.   \nAlthough high debt levels do not necessarily  \nindicate or cause economic problems, they may \ncreate certain systemic risks if sound debt   \nmanagement practices are not implemented. A   \nhigh national debt level may increase market  \npressures to meet government funding needs,   \nwhich may drive debt cost higher and cause a  \ncountry to sell additional debt, thereby      \nincreasing refinancing risk. A high national  \ndebt also raises concerns that a government   \nwill not be able to make principal or interest\npayments when they are due. In the worst case,\nunsustainable debt levels can cause a decline \nin the value of the dollar (which may lead to \ninflation), and can prevent the U.S.          \ngovernment from implementing effective        \ncounter-cyclical fiscal policy in economic    \ndownturns. U.S. Treasury securities are       \ncurrently given the top rating by all major   \nratings agencies except Standard & Poor's     \nRatings Services, which rates them AA+, one   \ngrade below their top rating. Since           \ndowngrading U.S. Treasury securities from AAA \nto AA+ in 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings     \nServices has affirmed its rating. A downgrade \nof the ratings of U.S. government debt        \nobligations, such as U.S. Treasury            \nobligations, which are often used as a        \nbenchmark for other                           \n                      9                       \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nborrowing arrangements, could result in higher\ninterest rates for individual                 \nand corporate borrowers, cause disruptions in \nthe international bond markets and have a     \nsubstantial negative effect on the U.S.       \neconomy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury         \nsecurities from another ratings agency or a   \nfurther downgrade below AA+ rating by         \nStandard & Poor's Ratings Services may cause  \nthe value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury         \nobligations to decline.                       \n                                              \nValuation Risk . Some portfolio holdings,     \npotentially a large portion of the Fund's     \ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the    \nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market  \nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are       \nmultiple methods that can be used to value a  \nportfolio holding when market quotations are  \nnot readily available. The value established  \nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time  \nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been     \npriced using market quotations. Portfolio     \nholdings that are valued using techniques     \nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair \nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater \nfluctuation in their valuations from one day  \nto the next than if market quotations were    \nused. Technological issues or other service   \ndisruption issues involving third-party       \nservice providers may cause the Fund to value \nits investments incorrectly. In addition,     \nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the     \nvalue established for it at any time, and it  \nis possible that the Fund would incur a loss  \nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby the Fund at that time.                     \n                                              \n  Non-Principal Risks                         \n                                              \nAuthorized Participants, Market Makers and    \nLiquidity Providers Concentration             \nRisk. The Fund has a limited number of        \nfinancial institutions that may act as        \nAuthorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are    \nresponsible for the creation and redemption   \nactivity for the Fund. In addition, there may \nbe a limited number of market makers and/or   \nliquidity providers in the marketplace. To the\nextent either of the following events occur,  \nFund Shares may trade at a material discount  \nto NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs   \nexit the business or otherwise become unable  \nto process creation and/or redemption orders  \nand no other APs step forward to perform these\nservices, or (ii) market makers and/or        \nliquidity providers exit the business or      \nsignificantly reduce their business activities\nand no other entities step forward to perform \ntheir functions.                              \n                                              \nCash Transaction Risk . To the extent that the\nFund sells portfolio securities to meet some  \nor all of a redemption request with cash, the \nFund may incur taxable gains or losses that it\nmight not have incurred had it made           \nredemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, the\nFund may pay out higher annual capital gain   \ndistributions than if the in-kind redemption  \nprocess was used.                             \n                                              \nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in  \nthe Fund will be subject to a number of actual\nor potential conflicts of interest. For       \nexample, the Adviser or its affiliates may    \nprovide services to the Fund, such as         \nsecurities lending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting   \nservices, transfer agency and shareholder     \nservicing, securities brokerage services, and \nother services for which the Fund would       \ncompensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates.\nThe Fund may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise     \naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no      \nassurance that the rates at which the Fund    \npays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its   \naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters   \ninto transactions with the Adviser or its     \naffiliates will be the most favorable         \navailable in the market generally or as       \nfavorable as the rates the Adviser or its     \naffiliates make available to other clients.   \nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into          \ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of the \nFund with itself or its affiliates in         \ncircumstances where it might not have done so \nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable       \nregulatory requirements.                      \n                                              \nThe Adviser and its affiliates                \nserve as investment adviser to other clients  \nand may make investment decisions that may be \ndifferent from those that will be made by the \nAdviser on behalf of the Fund. For example,   \nthe Adviser may provide asset allocation      \nadvice to some clients that                   \nmay include a recommendation to invest in or  \nredeem from particular issuers while not      \nproviding that same recommendation to all     \nclients invested in the same or similar       \nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to          \napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to  \npurchase (or sell) investments for the Fund   \nand to sell (or purchase) the same investment \nfor accounts, funds, or structured products   \nfor which it serves as asset manager, or for  \nother clients or affiliates. The Adviser and  \nits affiliates may invest                     \nfor clients in various securities that are    \nsenior, pari passu or junior to, or have      \ninterests different from or adverse to, the   \nsecurities that are owned by the Fund. The    \nAdviser or its affiliates, in                 \nconnection with its other business activities,\nmay acquire material nonpublic confidential   \ninformation that may restrict the Adviser from\npurchasing securities or selling securities   \nfor itself or its clients (including the Fund)\nor otherwise using                            \nsuch information for the benefit of its       \nclients or itself.                            \n                      10                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nThe foregoing does not purport to be a        \ncomprehensive list or                         \ncomplete explanation of all potential         \nconflicts of interests which may affect the   \nFund. The Fund may encounter circumstances, or\nenter into transactions, in which conflicts of\ninterest that are not listed or discussed     \nabove may arise.                              \n                                              \nCosts of Buying and Selling Shares . Investors\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket will pay brokerage commissions or other\ncharges imposed by brokers, as determined by  \nthat broker. Brokerage commissions are often a\nfixed amount and may be a significant         \nproportional cost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell relatively small amounts of Fund      \nShares. In addition, secondary market         \ninvestors will also incur the cost of the     \ndifference between the price that an investor \nis willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d  \nprice) and the price at which an investor is  \nwilling to sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price).\nThis difference in bid and ask prices is often\nreferred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask       \nspread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time  \nfor Fund Shares based on trading volume and   \nmarket liquidity, and is generally lower if   \nFund Shares have more trading volume and      \nmarket liquidity and higher if Fund Shares    \nhave little trading volume and market         \nliquidity. Further, increased market          \nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask        \nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,       \nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may           \nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making \nsmall investments.                            \n                                              \nCounterparty Risk. The Fund will be subject to\ncredit risk with respect to the counterparties\nwith which the Fund enters into derivatives   \ncontracts and other transactions such as      \nrepurchase agreements or reverse repurchase   \nagreements. The Fund's ability to profit from \nthese types of investments and transactions   \nwill depend on the willingness and ability of \nits counterparty to perform its obligations.  \nIf a counterparty fails to meet its           \ncontractual obligations, the Fund may be      \nunable to terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. The Fund may experience          \nsignificant delays in obtaining any recovery  \nin an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other        \nreorganization proceeding involving its       \ncounterparty (including recovery of any       \ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in \nsuch circumstances. If the Fund holds         \ncollateral posted by its counterparty, it may \nbe delayed or prevented from realizing on the \ncollateral in the event of a bankruptcy or    \ninsolvency proceeding relating to the         \ncounterparty. Under applicable law or         \ncontractual provisions, including if the Fund \nenters into an investment or transaction with \na financial institution and such financial    \ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial \ninstitution) experiences financial            \ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain    \nsituations be prevented or delayed from       \nexercising its rights to terminate the        \ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on   \nany collateral and may result in the          \nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or       \ntransactions or in another institution being  \nsubstituted for that financial institution    \nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, the \nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under   \napplicable law whereby, if required by the    \nfinancial institution's authority, the        \nfinancial institution's liabilities could be  \nwritten down, eliminated or converted into    \nequity or an alternative instrument of        \nownership. A bail-in of a financial           \ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of securities and, if the Fund \nholds such securities or has entered into a   \ntransaction with such a financial security    \nwhen a bail-in occurs, the Fund may also be   \nsimilarly impacted.                           \n                                              \nCybersecurity Risk . With the increased use of\ntechnologies such as the Internet and the     \ndependence on computer systems to perform     \nbusiness and operational functions, funds     \n(such as the Fund) and their service providers\n(including the Adviser) may be prone to       \noperational and information security risks    \nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or           \ntechnological malfunctions. In general, cyber-\nattacks are deliberate, but unintentional     \nevents may have similar effects. Cyber-attacks\ninclude, among others, stealing or corrupting \ndata maintained online or digitally,          \npreventing legitimate users from accessing    \ninformation or services on a website,         \nreleasing confidential information without    \nauthorization, and causing operational        \ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against, \nor security breakdowns of, the Fund, the      \nAdviser or a custodian, transfer agent, or    \nother affiliated or third-party service       \nprovider may adversely affect the Fund or its \nshareholders. For instance, cyber-attacks or  \ntechnical malfunctions may interfere with the \nprocessing of shareholder or other            \ntransactions, affect the Fund's ability to    \ncalculate its NAV, cause the release of       \nprivate shareholder information or            \nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject the    \nFund to regulatory fines, penalties or        \nfinancial losses, reimbursement or other      \ncompensation costs, and additional compliance \ncosts. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions\nmay render records of Fund assets and         \ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund   \nShares, and other data integral to the        \nfunctioning of the Fund inaccessible or       \ninaccurate or incomplete. The Fund may also   \nincur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents\nin the future. The Fund and its shareholders  \ncould be negatively impacted as a result.     \nWhile the Adviser has established a business  \ncontinuity plan and systems designed to       \nminimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the\nuse of technology, processes                  \n                      11                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nand controls, there are inherent limitations  \nin such plans and systems,                    \nincluding the possibility that certain risks  \nhave not been identified, given the evolving  \nnature of this threat. The Fund relies on     \nthird-party service providers for many of its \nday-to-day operations, and will be subject to \nthe risk that the                             \nprotections and protocols implemented by those\nservice providers will be ineffective to      \nprotect the Fund from cyber-attack. The       \nAdviser does not control the cybersecurity    \nplans and systems put in place by third-party \nservice providers, and such                   \nthird-party service providers may have limited\nindemnification obligations to the Adviser or \nthe Fund. Similar types of cybersecurity risks\nor technical malfunctions also are present for\nissuers of securities in which the Fund       \ninvests, which could                          \nresult in material adverse consequences for   \nsuch issuers, and may cause the Fund's        \ninvestment in such securities to lose value.  \n                                              \nDerivatives Risk. A derivative is a financial \ncontract the value of which depends on, or is \nderived from, the value of an underlying      \nasset, interest rate, or index. Derivative    \ntransactions typically involve leverage and   \nmay have significant volatility. It is        \npossible that a derivative transaction will   \nresult in a loss greater than the principal   \namount invested, and the Fund may not be able \nto close out a derivative transaction at a    \nfavorable time or price. Risks associated with\nderivative instruments include potential      \nchanges in value in response to interest rate \nchanges or other market developments or as a  \nresult of the counterparty's credit quality;  \nthe potential for the derivative transaction  \nnot to have the effect the Adviser anticipated\nor a different or less favorable effect than  \nthe Adviser anticipated; the failure of the   \ncounterparty to the derivative transaction to \nperform its obligations under the transaction \nor to settle a trade; possible mispricing or  \nimproper valuation of the derivative          \ninstrument; imperfect correlation in the value\nof a derivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that the  \nFund may be required to post collateral or    \nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be \nable to recover the collateral or margin in   \nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or \nbankruptcy; the risk that the Fund will       \nexperience losses on its derivatives          \ninvestments and on its other portfolio        \ninvestments, even when the derivatives        \ninvestments may be intended in part or        \nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for  \nthe derivative instrument, including without  \nlimitation absence of a secondary trading     \nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to  \nthe Fund due to losses on the transaction and \nan increase in volatility; the potential for  \nthe derivative transaction to have the effect \nof accelerating the recognition of gain; and  \nlegal risks arising from the documentation    \nrelating to the derivative transaction.       \n                                              \nIndex Construction Risk . A security included \nin the Index may not exhibit the              \ncharacteristic or provide the specific        \nexposure for which it was selected and        \nconsequently the Fund's holdings may not      \nexhibit returns consistent with that          \ncharacteristic or exposure.                   \n                                              \nIndex Licensing Risk . It is possible that the\nlicense under which the Adviser or the Fund is\npermitted to replicate or otherwise use the   \nIndex will be terminated or may be disputed,  \nimpaired or cease to remain in effect. In such\na case, the Adviser may be required to replace\nthe Index with another index which it         \nconsiders to be appropriate in light of the   \ninvestment strategy of the Fund. The use of   \nany such substitute index may have an adverse \nimpact on the Fund's performance. In the event\nthat the Adviser is unable to identify a      \nsuitable replacement for the Index, it may    \ndetermine to terminate the Fund.              \n                                              \nMoney Market Risk . An investment in a money  \nmarket fund is not a deposit of any bank and  \nis not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or   \nany other government agency. Certain money    \nmarket funds seek to preserve the value of    \ntheir shares at $1.00 per share, although     \nthere can be no assurance that they will do   \nso, and it is possible to lose money by       \ninvesting in such a money market fund. A major\nor unexpected change in interest rates or a   \ndecline in the credit quality of an issuer or \nentity providing credit support, an inactive  \ntrading market for money market instruments,  \nor adverse market, economic, industry,        \npolitical, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause the share price of such\na money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will   \nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at \ntimes when the fair value of the money market \nfund's portfolio per share is more or less    \nthan $1.00. None of State Street Corporation, \nState Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState   \nStreet\u201d), State Street Global Advisors, Inc.  \n(\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (\u201cState \nStreet Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an   \ninvestment in a money market fund at $1.00 per\nshare. Investors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from   \nState Street Entities. Other money market     \nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV  \nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the \nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be               \n                      12                      \nTable of Contents                             \nworth more or less than their original\npurchase price. Recent changes in the\nregulation of money market funds may affect\nthe operations and structures of money market\nfunds. A money market fund may be permitted or\nrequired to impose redemption fees or to\nimpose limitations on redemptions during\nperiods of high illiquidity in the markets for\nthe investments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . The Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to the Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nhave the effect of reducing the Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. The Fund may engage in frequent\ntrading of its portfolio securities in\nconnection with Index rebalancing. Frequent\ntrading may cause the Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent trading. Trading Issues\n. Although Fund Shares are listed for trading\non the Exchange and may be listed or traded on\nU.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than\nthe Exchange, there can be no assurance that\nan active trading market for the Fund Shares\nwill develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange may be halted due to\nmarket conditions or for reasons that, in the\nview of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange is subject to\ntrading halts caused by extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit\nbreaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock\nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While the Fund expects that the\nability of Authorized Participants to create\nand redeem Fund Shares at net asset value\nshould be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of the Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund and, subject to\nthe oversight of the Board, is responsible for\nthe investment management of the Fund. The\nAdviser provides an investment management\nprogram for the Fund and manages the\ninvestment of the Fund's assets. The Adviser\nis a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nGlobal Advisors, Inc., which itself is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation. The Adviser is registered with\nthe SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940, as amended. The Adviser and certain\nother affiliates of State Street Corporation\nmake up SSGA. SSGA is one of the world's\nlargest institutional money managers and the\ninvestment management arm of State Street\nCorporation. As of June 30, 2020, the Adviser\nmanaged approximately $612.89 billion in\nassets and SSGA managed approximately $3.05\ntrillion in assets. The Adviser's principal\nbusiness address is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. For the services provided\nto the Fund under the Investment Advisory\nAgreement, the Fund expects to pay the Adviser\nthe annual fee based on a percentage of the\nFund's average daily net assets as set forth\nbelow:\n                                           \n  SPDR\u00a0Bloomberg                  0.1345%  \n  Barclays 3-12 Month T-Bill\u00a0ETF           \n                                           \nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all\nor a portion of its management fee.

Given, however, that    \nFund Shares can be issued and redeemed daily  \nin Creation Units, the Adviser believes that  \nlarge discounts and premiums to net asset     \nvalue should not be                           \nsustained over long periods.\u00a0Information      \nshowing the number of days the market price of\nFund Shares was greater than the Fund's net   \nasset value and the number of days it was less\nthan the Fund's net asset value (i.e., premium\nor discount) for                              \nvarious time periods is available by visiting \nthe Fund's website at                         \nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs .                  \n                      16                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nThe Exchange will disseminate, every fifteen  \nseconds during                                \nthe regular trading day, an indicative        \noptimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to\nthe Fund. The IOPV calculations are estimates \nof the value of the Fund's net asset value per\nFund Share. Premiums and discounts between the\nIOPV and                                      \nthe market price may occur. This should not be\nviewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net     \nasset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is based \non the current market value of the published  \nbasket of portfolio securities and/or cash    \nrequired to be                                \ndeposited in exchange for a Creation Unit and \ndoes not necessarily reflect the precise      \ncomposition of\u00a0the Fund's actual portfolio at \na particular point in time. Moreover, the IOPV\nis generally determined by using current      \nmarket quotations                             \nand/or price quotations obtained from broker- \ndealers and other market intermediaries and   \nvaluations based on current market rates. The \nIOPV may not be calculated in the same manner \nas the NAV, which (i) is computed only once a \nday, (ii) unlike the                          \ncalculation of the IOPV, takes into account   \nFund expenses, and (iii) may be subject, in   \naccordance with the requirements of the 1940  \nAct, to fair valuation at different prices    \nthan those used in the calculations of the    \nIOPV. When applicable, the                    \nIOPV price is based on quotes and closing     \nprices from the securities' local market      \nconverted into U.S. dollars at the current    \ncurrency rates and may not reflect events that\noccur subsequent to the local market's close. \nTherefore, the IOPV may not                   \nreflect the best possible valuation of the    \nFund's current portfolio. Neither the Fund nor\nthe Adviser or any of their affiliates are    \ninvolved in, or responsible for, the          \ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and\nmake no warranty as to their                  \naccuracy.                                     \n                                              \nThe Fund does not impose any restrictions on  \nthe frequency of purchases and redemptions;   \nhowever, the Fund reserves the right to reject\nor limit purchases at any time as described in\nthe SAI. When considering that no restriction \nor policy was necessary, the Board evaluated  \nthe risks posed by                            \nmarket timing activities, such as whether     \nfrequent purchases and redemptions would      \ninterfere with the efficient implementation of\nthe Fund's investment strategy, or whether    \nthey would cause the Fund to experience       \nincreased transaction costs. The              \nBoard considered that, unlike traditional     \nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and      \nredeemed only in large quantities of shares   \nknown as Creation Units, available only from  \nthe Fund directly, and that most trading in   \nthe Fund occurs on the Exchange               \nat prevailing market prices and does not      \ninvolve the Fund directly. Given this         \nstructure, the Board determined that it is    \nunlikely that (a) market timing would be      \nattempted by the Fund's shareholders or (b)   \nany attempts to market time the Fund by       \nshareholders would result in negative impact  \nto the Fund or its shareholders.              \n                                              \nDistributions                                 \n                                              \nDividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund        \nshareholder, you are entitled to your share of\nthe Fund's income and net realized gains on   \nits investments. The Fund pays out            \nsubstantially all of its net earnings to its  \nshareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d              \n                                              \nThe\u00a0Fund\u00a0may earn interest from debt          \nsecurities and,                               \nif participating, securities lending income.  \nThe Fund will generally realize short-term    \ncapital gains or losses whenever it sells or  \nexchanges assets held for one year or less.   \nNet short-term capital gains will generally be\ntreated as ordinary                           \nincome when distributed to shareholders. The  \nFund will generally realize long-term capital \ngains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges\nassets held for more than one year. Net       \ncapital gains (the excess of the Fund's net   \nlong-term capital gains                       \nover its net short-term capital losses) are   \ndistributed to shareholders as \u201ccapital gain  \ndistributions.\u201d                               \n                                              \nIncome dividend distributions, if any, are    \ngenerally                                     \ndistributed to shareholders monthly, but may  \nvary significantly from period to period.     \n                                              \nNet capital gains for the Fund are distributed\nat least                                      \nannually. Dividends may be declared and paid  \nmore frequently or at any other time to       \nimprove Index tracking or to comply with the  \ndistribution requirements of the Internal     \nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nA portion of each                             \ndistribution may result in a return of        \ncapital. You will be notified regarding the   \nportion of the distribution which represents a\nreturn of capital.                            \n                                              \nDistributions in cash may be reinvested       \nautomatically in                              \nadditional whole Fund Shares only if the      \nbroker through whom you purchased Fund Shares \nmakes such option available. Distributions    \nwhich are reinvested will nevertheless be     \ntaxable to the same extent as if such         \ndistributions had not been                    \nreinvested.                                   \n                                              \nPortfolio Holdings Disclosure                 \n                                              \nThe Fund's portfolio holdings disclosure      \npolicy is described in the SAI.

Your \ninvestment in the Fund may have other tax     \nimplications. Please consult your tax advisor \nabout federal, state, local, foreign or other \ntax laws applicable                           \nto you. Investors, including non-U.S.         \ninvestors, may wish to consult the SAI tax    \nsection for additional disclosure.            \n                                              \nTaxes On Distributions. In general, your      \ndistributions are subject to federal income   \ntax when they are paid, whether you take them \nin cash or reinvest them in the Fund. The     \nincome dividends and short-term capital gains \ndistributions you receive from the Fund will  \ngenerally be taxed as ordinary income. Any    \ndistributions of the Fund's net capital gains \nare taxable as long-term capital gain         \nregardless of how long you have owned Fund    \nShares. Long-term capital gains are generally \ntaxed to noncorporate shareholders at rates of\nup to 20%. Distributions in excess of the     \nFund's current and accumulated earnings and   \nprofits are treated as a tax-free return of   \ncapital to the extent of your basis in the    \nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital    \ngain thereafter. Since the Fund primarily     \nholds investments that do not pay dividends,  \nit is not expected that a substantial portion \n(if any) of the dividends paid by the Fund    \nwill qualify for either the dividends-received\ndeduction for corporations or the favorable   \nincome tax rates available to individuals on  \nqualified dividend income.                    \n                                              \nU.S. individuals with income exceeding        \nspecified thresholds                          \nare subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution   \ntax on all or a portion of their \u201cnet         \ninvestment income,\u201d which includes taxable    \ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains \n(generally including capital gain             \ndistributions and capital gains               \nrealized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This  \n3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of  \nthe undistributed net investment income of    \ncertain shareholders that are estates and     \ntrusts.                                       \n                                              \nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions   \nwill be subject to                            \na 1.4% tax on net investment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain  \ndistributions, and certain gains from the     \ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other       \ncategories of income), are generally taken    \ninto account in computing a                   \nshareholder's net investment income.          \n                                              \nDistributions paid                            \nin January, but declared by the Fund in       \nOctober, November or December of the previous \nyear, payable to shareholders of record in    \nsuch a month, may be taxable to you in the    \ncalendar year in which they were declared. The\nFund will inform you of the                   \namount of your ordinary income dividends,     \ncapital gain distributions and any qualified  \ndividend income shortly after the close of    \neach calendar year.                           \n                                              \nA distribution will reduce the Fund's net     \nasset value per Fund                          \nShare and may be taxable to you as ordinary   \nincome or capital gain even though, from an   \ninvestment standpoint, the distribution may   \nconstitute a return of capital.               \n                                              \nOriginal Issue Discount . Investments by the  \nFund in zero coupon or other discount         \nsecurities will result in income to the Fund  \nequal to a portion of the excess face value of\nthe securities over their issue price (the    \n\u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or \u201cOID\u201d) each year \nthat the securities are held, even though the \nFund may receive no cash interest payments or \nmay receive cash interest payments that are   \nless than the income recognized for tax       \npurposes. In other circumstances, whether     \npursuant to the terms of a security or as a   \nresult of other factors outside the control of\nthe Fund, the Fund may recognize income       \nwithout receiving a commensurate amount of    \ncash. The Fund\u2018s share of such income is      \nincluded in determining the amount that the   \nFund must distribute to maintain its          \neligibility for treatment as a regulated      \ninvestment company and to avoid the payment of\nfederal tax, including the nondeductible 4%   \nexcise tax. Because any income required to be \nrecognized as a result of the OID and/or      \nmarket discount rules (discussed below) may   \nnot be matched by a corresponding cash        \npayment, the Fund may be required to borrow   \nmoney or dispose of securities to be able to  \nmake distributions to its shareholders in     \norder to qualify for treatment as a regulated \ninvestment company and eliminate taxes at the \nFund level.                                   \n                                              \nInflation-Indexed Bonds. Special rules apply  \nif the Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds.    \nGenerally, all stated interest on inflation-  \nindexed bonds is taken into income by the Fund\nunder its regular method of accounting for    \ninterest income. The amount of any positive   \ninflation adjustment for a taxable year, which\nresults from an increase in the inflation-    \nadjusted principal amount of the bond, is     \ntreated as OID. The amount of the Fund's OID  \nin a taxable year with respect to a bond will \nincrease the Fund's taxable income for such   \nyear without a corresponding receipt of cash  \nuntil the bond matures. As a result, the Fund \nmay need to use other sources of cash to      \nsatisfy its distribution requirements for such\nyear. The amount of any negative inflation    \nadjustments, which result from a decrease in  \nthe inflation-adjusted principal amount of the\nbond, first reduces the amount of interest    \n(including stated interest, OID, and market   \ndiscount, if any)                             \n                      18                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \notherwise includible in the Fund's income with\nrespect to the bond for the                   \ntaxable year; any remaining negative          \nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary\nloss or, in certain circumstances, carried    \nforward to reduce the amount of interest      \nincome taken into account with respect to the \nbond in future taxable years.                 \n                                              \nMarket Discount. Any market discount          \nrecognized on a market discount bond is       \ntaxable as ordinary income. A market discount \nbond is a bond acquired in the secondary      \nmarket at a price below redemption value or   \nbelow adjusted issue price if the bond was    \nissued with original issue discount. Absent an\nelection by the Fund to include the market    \ndiscount in income as it accrues, the gain on \nthe Fund's disposition of such an obligation  \nwill be treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued     \nmarket discount. Where the income required to \nbe recognized as a result of the market       \ndiscount rules is not matched by a            \ncorresponding cash payment, the Fund may be   \nrequired to borrow money or dispose of        \nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for      \ntreatment as a regulated investment company   \nand eliminate taxes at the Fund level,        \npotentially resulting in additional taxable   \ngain or loss to the Fund.                     \n                                              \nDerivatives and Other Complex Securities. The \nFund may invest in complex securities. These  \ninvestments may be subject to numerous special\nand complex rules. These rules could affect   \nwhether gains and losses recognized by the    \nFund are treated as ordinary income or capital\ngain, accelerate the recognition of income to \nthe Fund and/or defer the Fund's ability to   \nrecognize losses. In turn, these rules may    \naffect the amount, timing or character of the \nincome distributed to you by the Fund. You    \nshould consult your personal tax advisor      \nregarding the application of these rules.     \n                                              \nForeign Currency                              \nTransactions. The Fund's transactions in      \nforeign currencies, foreign currency          \ndenominated debt obligations and certain      \nforeign currency options, futures contracts   \nand forward contracts (and similar            \ninstruments) may give rise to ordinary income \nor loss to the extent such income or loss     \nresults from fluctuations in the value of the \nforeign currency concerned.                   \n                                              \nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any     \ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of  \nFund Shares is generally treated as long-term \ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been \nheld for more than one year and as short-term \ncapital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been \nheld for one year or less, except that any    \ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held  \nfor six months or less is treated as long-term\ncapital loss to the extent that capital gain  \ndividends were paid with respect to the Fund  \nShares.                                       \n                                              \nTaxes on Creations and Redemptions of         \nCreation Units. A person who exchanges        \nsecurities for Creation Units generally will  \nrecognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss    \nwill be equal to the difference between the   \nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time\nand the exchanger's aggregate basis in the    \nsecurities surrendered plus any cash paid for \nthe Creation Units. A person who exchanges    \nCreation Units for securities will generally  \nrecognize a gain or loss equal to the         \ndifference between the exchanger's basis in   \nthe Creation Units and the aggregate market   \nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The Internal Revenue Service (the   \n\u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss       \nrealized upon an exchange of securities for   \nCreation Units cannot be deducted currently   \nunder the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on \nthe basis that there has been no significant  \nchange in economic position. Persons          \nexchanging securities should consult their own\ntax advisor with respect to whether wash sale \nrules apply and when a loss might be          \ndeductible.                                   \n                                              \nUnder current federal tax laws, any capital   \ngain or loss                                  \nrealized upon a redemption (or creation) of   \nCreation Units is generally treated as long-  \nterm capital gain or loss if the Fund Shares  \n(or securities surrendered) have been held for\nmore than one year and as a short-term capital\ngain or loss if the                           \nFund Shares (or securities surrendered) have  \nbeen held for one year or less.               \n                                              \nIf you create or redeem Creation Units, you   \nwill be sent a                                \nconfirmation statement showing how many Fund  \nShares you purchased or sold and at what      \nprice.                                        \n                                              \nThe Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has the     \nright to reject an                            \norder for Creation Units if the purchaser (or \na group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining  \nthe Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of\nthe outstanding shares of the\u00a0Fund and if,    \npursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the\u00a0Fund \nwould have a                                  \nbasis in the securities different from the    \nmarket value of the securities on the date of \ndeposit.\u00a0 The Trust also has the right to     \nrequire information necessary to determine    \nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80%                                           \ndetermination.\u00a0 If the Trust does issue       \nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of  \npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the    \nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the\u00a0Fund, the purchaser \n(or group of                                  \npurchasers) will not recognize gain or loss   \nupon the exchange of securities for Creation  \nUnits.                                        \n                      19                      \nTable of Contents                             \n                                              \nIf the Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it\nmay bear                                      \nadditional costs and recognize more capital   \ngains than it would if it redeems Creation    \nUnits in-kind.                                \n                                              \nNon-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income dividends \npaid by the Fund to shareholders who are non- \nresident aliens or foreign entities will      \ngenerally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax (other than distributions reported by the \nFund as interest-related dividends and short- \nterm capital gain dividends), unless a lower  \ntreaty rate applies or unless such income is  \neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or    \nbusiness. In general, the Fund may report     \ninterest-related dividends to the extent of   \nits net income derived from U.S. source       \ninterest, and the Fund may report short-term  \ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net  \nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year  \nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains \non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that \nare, in each case, effectively connected with \nthe conduct of a trade or business within the \nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax     \nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,        \ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of the   \nFund's shares are urged to consult their own  \ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment.                \n                                              \nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold    \nFund Shares comply                            \nwith IRS requirements that will generally     \nrequire them to report information regarding  \nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply\u00a0to distributions payable to such        \nentities. A non-U.S.                          \nshareholder may be exempt from the withholding\ndescribed in this paragraph under an          \napplicable intergovernmental agreement between\nthe U.S. and a foreign government, provided   \nthat the shareholder and the applicable       \nforeign government comply with the            \nterms of such agreement.                      \n                                              \nBackup Withholding. The Fund will be required \nin certain cases to withhold (as \u201cbackup      \nwithholding\u201d) on amounts payable to any       \nshareholder who (1) has provided the Fund     \neither an incorrect tax identification number \nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup \nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3) \nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such   \nshareholder is not subject to backup          \nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that    \nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding  \nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been     \nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on         \nshareholders who are neither citizens nor     \npermanent residents of the United States.     \n                                              \nCertain Potential Tax Reporting Requirements. \nUnder U.S. Treasury regulations, if a         \nshareholder recognizes a loss of $2 million or\nmore for an individual shareholder or $10     \nmillion or more for a corporate shareholder   \n(or certain greater amounts over a combination\nof years), the shareholder must file with the \nIRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886.      \nDirect shareholders of portfolio securities   \nare in many cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance       \nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted.       \nSignificant penalties may be imposed for the  \nfailure to comply with the reporting          \nrequirements. The fact that a loss is         \nreportable under these regulations does not   \naffect the legal determination of whether the \ntaxpayer's treatment of the loss is proper.   \nShareholders should consult their tax advisors\nto determine the applicability of these       \nregulations in light of their individual      \ncircumstances.                                \n                                              \nOther Tax Issues. The Fund may be subject to  \ntax in certain states where the Fund does     \nbusiness (or is treated as doing business as a\nresult of its investments). Furthermore, in   \nthose states which have income tax laws, the  \ntax treatment of the Fund and of Fund         \nshareholders with respect to distributions by \nthe Fund may differ from federal tax          \ntreatment.                                    \n                                              \nThe foregoing discussion summarizes some of   \nthe consequences                              \nunder current federal income tax law of an    \ninvestment in the Fund. It is not a substitute\nfor personal tax advice. Consult your personal\ntax advisor about the potential tax           \nconsequences of an investment in the Fund     \nunder all applicable tax                      \nlaws.                                         \n                                              \nGeneral Information                           \n                                              \nThe Trust was organized as a Massachusetts    \nbusiness trust on June\u00a012,                    \n1998.

The\nTrust was organized as a Massachusetts\nbusiness trust on June 12, 1998. The offering\nof the Fund\u0092s shares (\u0093Shares\u0094) is registered\nunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended\n(the \u0093Securities Act\u0094). The investment\nobjective of the Fund is to provide investment\nresults that, before fees and expenses,\ncorrespond generally to the price and yield\nperformance of a specified market index (the\n\u0093Index\u0094). SSGA Funds Management, Inc. serves\nas the investment\nadviser for the Fund (\u0093SSGA FM\u0094 or the\n\u0093Adviser\u0094).\n\nThe Fund offers and issues Shares at its net\nasset value (sometimes referred to\nherein as \u0093NAV\u0094) only in aggregations of a\nspecified number of Shares (each, a \u0093Creation\nUnit\u0094). The Fund generally offers and issues\nShares either in exchange for (i) a basket of\nsecurities included in its Index\n(\u0093Deposit Securities\u0094) together with the\ndeposit of a specified cash payment (\u0093Cash\nComponent\u0094) or (ii) a cash payment equal in\nvalue to the Deposit Securities (\u0093Deposit\nCash\u0094) together with the Cash Component. The\nprimary consideration accepted by the Fund\n(i.e., Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash) is\nset forth under \u0093Purchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units\u0094 later in this SAI. The Trust\nreserves the right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of a \u0093cash in lieu\u0094 amount to be\nadded to the Cash Component to replace any\nDeposit Security and reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of Deposit Cash (subject to\napplicable\nlegal requirements). The Shares have been\napproved for listing and secondary trading on\na national securities exchange (the\n\u0093Exchange\u0094). The Shares will trade on the\nExchange at market prices. These prices may\ndiffer from the Shares\u0092\nnet asset values. The Shares are also\nredeemable only in Creation Unit aggregations,\nand generally in exchange either for (i)\nportfolio securities and a specified cash\npayment or (ii) cash (subject to applicable\nlegal requirements). A\nCreation Unit of the Fund consists of 50,000\nShares.\n\nShares may be issued in advance of receipt of\nDeposit Securities subject to various\nconditions\nincluding a requirement to maintain on deposit\nwith the Trust cash at least equal to a\nspecified percentage of the market value of\nthe missing Deposit Securities, as set forth\nin the Participant Agreement (as defined\nbelow). See \u0093Purchase and\nRedemption of Creation Units.\u0094 The Trust may\nimpose a transaction fee for each creation or\nredemption. In all cases, such fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u0093SEC\u0094)\napplicable to management investment companies\noffering redeemable securities. In addition to\nthe fixed creation or redemption transaction\nfee, an additional transaction fee of up to\nthree times the fixed creation or redemption\ntransaction fee and/or\nan additional variable charge may apply.\n\nINVESTMENT POLICIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in the following types of\ninvestments, consistent with its investment\nstrategies and objective. Please see the\nFund\u0092s Prospectus for\nadditional information regarding its principal\ninvestment strategies.\n\nDIVERSIFICATION STATUS\n\nThe Fund is classified as a \u0093diversified\u0094\ninvestment company under the 1940 Act. Under\nthe 1940 Act, a diversified investment\ncompany, as to 75% of\nits total assets, may not purchase securities\nof any issuer (other than securities issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, its agents\nor instrumentalities or securities of other\ninvestment companies) if, as a result, more\nthan 5% of its total\nassets would be invested in the securities of\nsuch issuer, or more than 10% of the issuer\u0092s\noutstanding voting securities would be held by\nthe investment company.\n\nThe Fund seeks to track the performance of its\nIndex. The composition of the Index may\nfluctuate between diversified and\nnon-diversified solely due to changes in\nweightings of one or more Index components. As\na result, the Fund\u0092s diversification status\nalso may fluctuate between diversified and\nnon-diversified depending on the composition\nof, and to approximately the same extent as,\nits Index. A \u0093non-diversified\u0094 classification\nmeans that a fund is not\nlimited by the 1940 Act with regard to the\npercentage of its assets that may be invested\nin the securities of a single issuer. This\nmeans that a non-diversified fund may invest a\ngreater portion of its assets\nin the securities of a single issuer than a\ndiversified fund. To the extent the Fund\nbecomes non-diversified due solely to changes\nin the composition of its Index, it will not\nseek shareholder approval if and\nwhen the Fund shifts from diversified to non-\ndiversified.\n\nThe Fund intends to maintain the required\nlevel of\ndiversification and otherwise conduct its\noperations so as to qualify as a \u0093regulated\ninvestment company\u0094 (\u0093RIC\u0094) for purposes of\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(the \u0093Internal Revenue Code\u0094), and to\nrelieve the Fund of any liability for federal\nincome tax to the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to shareholders. Compliance with\nthe diversification requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code may severely limit the\ninvestment flexibility of\nthe Fund and may make it less likely that the\nFund will meet its investment objective.\n\n3\n\nBONDS\n\nA bond\nis an interest-bearing security issued by a\ncompany, governmental unit or, in some cases,\na non-U.S. entity. The issuer of a bond has a\ncontractual obligation to pay interest at a\nstated rate on specific dates\nand to repay principal (the bond\u0092s face value)\nperiodically or on a specified maturity date;\nprovided, however, a zero coupon bond pays no\ninterest to its holder during its life. The\nvalue of a zero coupon bond to the Fund\nconsists of the\ndifference between such bond\u0092s face value at\nthe time of maturity and the price for which\nit was acquired, which may be an amount\nsignificantly less than its face value\n(sometimes referred to as a \u0093deep discount\u0094\nprice).\n\nAn issuer may have the right to redeem or\n\u0093call\u0094 a bond before maturity, in which case\nthe investor may have to reinvest the proceeds\nat lower\nmarket rates. Most bonds bear interest income\nat a \u0093coupon\u0094 rate that is fixed for the life\nof the bond. The value of a fixed rate bond\nusually rises when market interest rates fall,\nand falls when market interest rates rise.\nAccordingly,\na fixed rate bond\u0092s yield (income as a percent\nof the bond\u0092s current value) may differ from\nits coupon rate as its value rises or falls.\nFixed rate bonds generally are also subject to\ninflation risk, which is the risk that the\nvalue of the\nbond or income from the bond will be worth\nless in the future as inflation decreases the\nvalue of money. This could mean that, as\ninflation increases, the \u0093real\u0094 value of the\nassets of the Fund holding fixed rate bonds\ncan decline, as can\nthe value of the Fund\u0092s distributions. Other\ntypes of bonds bear income at an interest rate\nthat is adjusted periodically. Because of\ntheir adjustable interest rates, the value of\n\u0093floating-rate\u0094 or \u0093variable-rate\u0094 bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed rate bonds. The Fund may treat some of\nthese bonds as having a shorter maturity for\npurposes of calculating the weighted average\nmaturity of its investment\nportfolio. Bonds may be senior or subordinated\nobligations. Senior obligations generally have\nthe first claim on a corporation\u0092s earnings\nand assets and, in the event of liquidation,\nare paid before subordinated obligations.\nBonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer\u0092s general\ncreditworthiness) or secured (also backed by\nspecified collateral).\n\nThe investment return of\ncorporate bonds reflects interest on the bond\nand changes in the market value of the bond.\nThe market value of a corporate bond may be\naffected by the credit rating of the\ncorporation, the corporation\u0092s performance and\nperceptions of the\ncorporation in the market place. There is a\nrisk that the issuers of the securities may\nnot be able to meet their obligations on\ninterest or principal payments at the time\ncalled for by such a security.\n\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER\n\nCommercial paper consists of short-term,\npromissory notes issued by banks, corporations\nand other entities to finance short-term\ncredit needs. These securities generally are\ndiscounted but sometimes may be interest\nbearing.\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\nThe Fund will concentrate its investments in\nsecurities of issuers in the same industry as\nmay be necessary to approximate the\ncomposition of the Fund\u0092s underlying Index.\nThe securities of issuers in particular\nindustries may dominate the benchmark Index of\nthe Fund and consequently the\nFund\u0092s investment portfolio. This may\nadversely affect the Fund\u0092s performance or\nsubject its Shares to greater price volatility\nthan that experienced by less concentrated\ninvestment companies. The Trust\u0092s general\npolicy is to exclude\nsecurities of the U.S. government and its\nagencies or instrumentalities when measuring\nindustry concentration.\n\nIn pursuing its objective, the Fund may\nhold the securities of a single issuer in an\namount exceeding 10% of the market value of\nthe outstanding securities of the issuer,\nsubject to restrictions imposed by the\nInternal Revenue Code. In particular, as the\nFund\u0092s size grows and its\nassets increase, it will be more likely to\nhold more than 10% of the securities of a\nsingle issuer if the issuer has a relatively\nsmall public float as compared to other\ncomponents in its benchmark Index.\n\nFUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may\ninvest up to 20% of its assets in derivatives,\nincluding exchange-traded futures on\nTreasuries or Eurodollars, U.S. exchange-\ntraded or OTC put and call options contracts\nand exchange-traded or OTC swap transactions\n(including NDFs interest rate\nswaps, total return swaps, excess return\nswaps, and credit default swaps). The Fund\nwill segregate cash and/or appropriate liquid\nassets if required to do so by SEC or CFTC\nregulation or interpretation.\n\nRecent legislation calls for new regulation of\nthe derivatives markets. The extent and impact\nof the regulation is not yet fully known and\nmay not be for some\ntime. New regulations could adversely affect\nthe value, availability and performance of\ncertain derivative instruments, may make them\nmore costly, and may limit or restrict their\nuse by the Fund.\n\n4\n\nFutures contracts generally provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a\nspecified commodity or security at a specified\nfuture time and at a specified price. Index\nfutures contracts are settled daily with a\npayment by one party to the other of a cash\namount based on the difference between the\nlevel of the index specified\nin the contract from one day to the next. A\nfutures contract on an index is an agreement\npursuant to which two parties agree to take or\nmake delivery of an amount of cash equal to\nthe difference between the value of the index\nat the close of the\nlast trading day of the contract and the price\nat which the index contract originally was\nwritten. Although the value of an index might\nbe a function of the value of certain\nspecified securities, physical delivery of\nthese securities is not always\nmade. A public market exists in futures\ncontracts covering a number of indexes, as\nwell as financial instruments, including,\nwithout limitation: U.S. Treasury bonds; U.S.\nTreasury notes; GNMA Certificates; three-month\nU.S. Treasury bills; 90-day commercial paper;\nbank certificates of deposit; Eurodollar\ncertificates of deposit; the Australian\nDollar; the Canadian Dollar; the British\nPound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss Franc; the\nMexican Peso; and\ncertain multinational currencies, such as the\nEuro. It is expected that other futures\ncontracts will be developed and traded in the\nfuture. Futures contracts are standardized as\nto maturity date and underlying instrument and\nare traded on futures\nexchanges.\n\nThe Fund may purchase and write (sell) call\nand put options on futures. Options on futures\ngive the holder the right, in return for the\npremium paid, to assume a long position (call)\nor short position (put) in a futures contract\nat a specified exercise price upon expiration\nof, or at any time during the period of, the\noption. Upon exercise of a call option, the\nholder acquires a\nlong position in the futures contract and the\nwriter is assigned the opposite short\nposition. In the case of a put option, the\nopposite is true. The Fund is required to make\na good faith margin deposit in cash or U.S.\ngovernment securities (or other\neligible collateral) with a broker or\ncustodian to initiate and maintain open\npositions in futures contracts. A margin\ndeposit is intended to assure completion of\nthe contract (delivery or acceptance of the\nunderlying commodity or payment of the\ncash settlement amount) if it is not\nterminated prior to the specified delivery\ndate. Brokers may establish deposit\nrequirements which are higher than the\nexchange minimums. Futures contracts are\ncustomarily purchased and sold on margin\ndeposits\nwhich may range upward from less than 5% of\nthe value of the contract being traded.\n\nAfter a futures contract position is opened,\nthe value of the\ncontract is marked to market daily. If the\nfutures contract price changes to the extent\nthat the margin on deposit does not satisfy\nprice changes additional payments will be\nrequired. Conversely, change in the contract\nvalue may reduce the required\nmargin, resulting in a repayment of excess\nmargin to the contract holder. Variation\nmargin payments are made to and from the\nfutures broker for as long as the contract\nremains open. In such case, the Fund would\nexpect to earn interest income on its\nmargin deposits. Although some futures\ncontracts call for making or taking delivery\nof the underlying commodity, generally these\nobligations are closed out prior to delivery\nby offsetting purchases or sales of matching\nfutures contracts (involving\nthe same exchange, underlying security or\nindex and delivery month). If an offsetting\npurchase price is less than the original sale\nprice, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if\nit is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss.\nConversely, if an\noffsetting sale price is more than the\noriginal purchase price, the Fund realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is less, the Fund\nrealizes a capital loss. The transaction costs\nalso must be included in these calculations.\n\n. The Fund intends to use commodity interests\nsuch as futures, swaps and options on futures\nin accordance\nwith Rule 4.5 of the CEA. The Fund may use\nexchange-traded futures and options on\nfutures, together with positions in cash and\nmoney market instruments, to simulate full\ninvestment in its underlying Index. Exchange-\ntraded futures and options on\nfutures contracts may not be currently\navailable for the Index. Under such\ncircumstances, the Adviser may seek to utilize\nother instruments that it believes to be\ncorrelated to the Index components or a subset\nof the components. An exclusion from\nthe definition of the term \u0093commodity pool\noperator\u0094 has been claimed with respect to\neach series of the Trust in accordance with\nRule 4.5 such that registration or regulation\nas a commodity pool operator under the CEA is\nnot necessary.\n\n. The Fund reserves the right to engage in\ntransactions involving futures, options\nthereon and swaps\nto the extent allowed by the CFTC regulations\nin effect from time to time and in accordance\nwith the Fund\u0092s policies. The Fund would take\nsteps to prevent its futures positions from\n\u0093leveraging\u0094 its securities holdings. When it\nhas a\nlong futures position, it will maintain with\nits custodian bank assets substantially\nidentical to those underlying the contract or\ncash and equivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under\nthe contract (less the value of any margin\ndeposits in connection with the position).\nWhen it has a short futures position, it will\nmaintain with its custodian bank assets\nsubstantially identical to those underlying\nthe contract or cash and\nequivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position).\n\n. The Fund may purchase and sell put and call\noptions. Such options may relate to particular\nsecurities and may or may not be listed on a\nnational securities exchange and issued by the\nOptions Clearing Corporation. Options trading\nis a highly specialized activity that entails\ngreater than ordinary investment risk. Options\non particular securities may be more volatile\nthan the\nunderlying securities, and therefore, on a\npercentage basis, an investment in options may\nbe subject to greater fluctuation than an\ninvestment in the underlying securities\nthemselves.\n\nThe Fund may engage in short sales \u0093against\nthe box.\u0094 In a short sale against the box, the\nFund\nagrees to sell at a future date a security\nthat it either contemporaneously owns or has\nthe right to acquire at no extra cost. If the\nprice of the security has declined at the time\nthe Fund is required to deliver the security,\nthe Fund will benefit\nfrom the difference in the price. If the price\nof the security has increased, the Fund will\nbe required to pay the difference.\n\n5\n\n. The Fund may enter into swap transactions,\nincluding interest rate, swap, credit\ndefault swap, NDF, and total return swap\ntransactions. Swap transactions are contracts\nbetween parties in which one party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the other party\nbased on the change in market value or level\nof a specified rate, index or\nasset. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake payments to the first party based on the\nreturn of a different specified rate, index or\nasset. Swap transactions will usually be done\non a net basis, i.e., where the two parties\nmake net\npayments with the Fund receiving or paying, as\nthe case may be, only the net amount of the\ntwo payments. The net amount of the excess, if\nany, of the Fund\u0092s obligations over its\nentitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis\nand an amount of cash or equivalents having an\naggregate value at least equal to the accrued\nexcess is maintained by the Fund. Swaps may be\nused in conjunction with other instruments to\noffset interest rate, currency or other\nunderlying risks. For\nexample, interest rate swaps may be offset\nwith \u0093caps,\u0094 \u0093floors\u0094 or \u0093collars\u0094. A \u0093cap\u0094 is\nessentially a call option which places a limit\non the amount of floating rate interest that\nmust be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u0093floor\u0094 is essentially a\nput option which places a limit on the minimum\namount that would be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u0093collar\u0094 is essentially a\ncombination of a long cap and a short floor\nwhere\nthe limits are set at different levels.\n\nThe use of swap transactions by the Fund\nentails certain risks, which may be different\nfrom, or possibly greater\nthan, the risks associated with investing\ndirectly in the securities and other\ninvestments that are the referenced asset for\nthe swap agreement. Swaps are highly\nspecialized instruments that require\ninvestment techniques, risk analyses, and tax\nplanning different from those associated with\nstocks, bonds, and other traditional\ninvestments. The use of a swap requires an\nunderstanding not only of the referenced\nasset, reference rate, or index, but also of\nthe swap itself, without the benefit\nof observing the performance of the swap under\nall the possible market conditions. Because\nsome swap transactions have a leverage\ncomponent, adverse changes in the value or\nlevel of the underlying asset, reference rate,\nor index can result in a loss\nsubstantially greater than the amount invested\nin the swap itself. Certain swaps have the\npotential for unlimited loss, regardless of\nthe size of the initial investment.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the \u0093Dodd-Frank Act\u0094) that was\nsigned into law on July 21, 2010 created a new\nstatutory framework that comprehensively\nregulated the over-the-counter (\u0093OTC\u0094)\nderivatives markets for the first time. Key\nDodd-Frank Act provisions relating\nto OTC derivatives require rulemaking by the\nSEC and the CFTC, not all of which has been\nproposed or finalized as at the date of this\nSAI. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTC\nderivatives markets were traditionally traded\non a bilateral basis (so-called \u0093bilateral OTC\ntransactions\u0094). Under the Dodd-Frank Act,\ncertain OTC derivatives transactions are now\nrequired to be centrally cleared and traded on\nexchanges or electronic trading platforms\ncalled swap execution facilities (\u0093SEFs\u0094).\n\nBilateral OTC transactions differ from\nexchange-traded or cleared derivatives\ntransactions in\nseveral respects. Bilateral OTC transactions\nare transacted directly with dealers and not\nwith a clearing corporation. Without the\navailability of a clearing corporation,\nbilateral OTC transaction pricing is normally\ndone by reference to information\nfrom market makers and/or available index\ndata, which information is carefully monitored\nby the Adviser and verified in appropriate\ncases. As bilateral OTC transactions are\nentered into directly with a dealer, there is\na risk of nonperformance by\nthe dealer as a result of its insolvency or\notherwise. Under recently-adopted regulations\nby the CFTC and federal banking regulators\n(\u0093Margin Rules\u0094), the Fund is required to post\ncollateral (known as variation margin) to\ncover the mark-to-market exposure in respect\nof its uncleared swaps. The Margin Rules also\nmandate that collateral in the form of initial\nmargin be posted to cover potential future\nexposure attributable to uncleared swap\ntransactions. In the event the Fund is\nrequired to post collateral in the form of\ninitial margin or variation margin in respect\nof its uncleared swap transactions, all such\ncollateral will be posted with a\nthird party custodian pursuant to a triparty\ncustody agreement between the Fund, its dealer\ncounterparty and an unaffiliated custodian.\n\nThe requirement\nto execute certain OTC derivatives contracts\non SEFs may offer certain advantages over\ntraditional bilateral OTC trading, such as\nease of execution, price transparency,\nincreased liquidity and/or favorable pricing.\nHowever, SEF trading may make it\nmore difficult and costly for the Fund to\nenter into highly tailored or customized\ntransactions and may result in additional\ncosts and risks. Market participants such as\nthe Fund that execute derivatives contracts\nthrough a SEF, whether directly or\nthrough a broker intermediary, are required to\nsubmit to the jurisdiction of the SEF and\ncomply with SEF and CFTC rules and regulations\nwhich impose, among other things disclosure\nand recordkeeping obligations. In addition,\nthe Fund will generally\nincur SEF or broker intermediary fees when it\ntrades on a SEF. The Fund may also be required\nto indemnify the SEF or broker intermediary\nfor any losses or costs that may result from\nthe Fund\u0092s transactions on the SEF.\n\n. The Fund may enter into total return swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. Total\nreturn swaps are transactions in which one\nparty agrees to make periodic payments based\non the change in market value of the\nunderlying assets, which may include a\nspecified security, basket of securities or\nsecurity indexes during the specified period,\nin return for periodic payments based\non a fixed or variable interest rate of the\ntotal return from other underlying assets.\nTotal return swaps may be used to obtain\nexposure to a security or market without\nowning or taking physical custody of such\nsecurity or market, including in cases\nin which there may be disadvantages associated\nwith direct ownership of a particular\nsecurity. In a typical total return equity\nswap, payments made by the Fund or the\ncounterparty are based on the total return of\na particular reference asset or\nassets (such as an equity security, a\n\n6\n\ncombination of such securities, or an index).\nThat is, one party agrees to pay another party\nthe return on a stock, basket of stocks, or\nstock index in return for a specified interest\nrate. By\nentering into an equity index swap, for\nexample, the index receiver can gain exposure\nto stocks making up the index of securities\nwithout actually purchasing those stocks.\nTotal return swaps involve not only the risk\nassociated with the investment\nin the underlying securities, but also the\nrisk of the counterparty not fulfilling its\nobligations under the agreement.\n\n. The\nFund may enter into credit default swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. A credit\ndefault swap transaction may have as reference\nobligations one or more securities that are\nnot currently held by the Fund. The Fund may\nbe either the protection\nbuyer or protection seller in the transaction.\nCredit default swaps may also be structured\nbased on the debt of a basket of issuers,\nrather than a single issuer, and may be\ncustomized with respect to the default event\nthat triggers purchase or other\nfactors. As a protection seller, the Fund\nwould generally receive an upfront payment or\na fixed rate of income throughout the term of\nthe swap, which typically is between six\nmonths and three years, provided that there is\nno credit event. If a\ncredit event occurs, generally the protection\nseller must pay the protection buyer the full\nface amount of the reference obligations that\nmay have little or no value. The notional\nvalue of the credit default swap will be used\nto segregate liquid\nassets for selling protection on credit\ndefault swaps. If the Fund were a protection\nbuyer and no credit event occurred during the\nterm of the swap, the Fund would recover\nnothing if the swap were held through its\ntermination date. However, if a\ncredit event occurred, the protection buyer\nmay elect to receive the full notional value\nof the swap in exchange for an equal face\namount of the reference obligation that may\nhave little or no value. Where the Fund is the\nprotection buyer, credit\ndefault swaps involve the risk that the seller\nmay fail to satisfy its payment obligations to\nthe Fund in the event of a default. The\npurchase of credit default swaps involves\ncosts, which will reduce the Fund\u0092s return.\nWhen the Fund buys\ncredit default swaps it will segregate an\namount at least equal to the amount of any\naccrued premium payment obligations including\namounts for early terminations.\n\n. The Fund may enter into currency swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. Currency\nswaps are similar to interest rate swaps,\nexcept\nthat they involve multiple currencies. The\nFund may enter into a currency swap when it\nhas exposure to one currency and desires\nexposure to a different currency. Typically,\nthe interest rates that determine the currency\nswap payments are fixed,\nalthough occasionally one or both parties may\npay a floating rate of interest. Unlike an\ninterest rate swap, however, the principal\namounts are exchanged at the beginning of the\ncontract and returned at the end of the\ncontract. In addition to paying\nand receiving amounts at the beginning and end\nof the transaction, both sides will have to\npay in full on a periodic basis based upon the\ncurrency they have borrowed. Change in foreign\nexchange rates and changes in interest rates,\nas described\nabove, may negatively affect currency swaps.\n\n. The Fund may enter into an interest rate\nswap in an effort to protect against\ndeclines in the value of fixed income\nsecurities held by the Fund. In such an\ninstance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed\nrate (multiplied by a notional amount) while a\ncounterparty agrees to pay a floating rate\n(multiplied by the same notional\namount). If interest rates rise, resulting in\na diminution in the value of the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio, the Fund would receive payments\nunder the swap that would offset, in whole or\nin part, such diminution in value.\n\n. An option on a swap agreement, or a\n\u0093swaption,\u0094 is a contract that gives a\ncounterparty the right (but not the\nobligation)\nto enter into a new swap agreement or to\nshorten, extend, cancel or otherwise modify an\nexisting swap agreement, at some designated\nfuture time on specified terms. In return, the\npurchaser pays a \u0093premium\u0094 to the seller of\nthe contract.\nThe seller of the contract receives the\npremium and bears the risk of unfavorable\nchanges on the underlying swap. The Fund may\nwrite (sell) and purchase put and call\nswaptions. The Fund may also enter into\nswaptions on either an asset-based or\nliability-based basis, depending on whether\nthe Fund is hedging its assets or its\nliabilities. The Fund may write (sell) and\npurchase put and call swaptions to the same\nextent it may make use of standard options on\nsecurities or other instruments.\nThe Fund may enter into these transactions\nprimarily to preserve a return or spread on a\nparticular investment or portion of its\nholdings, as a duration management technique,\nto protect against an increase in the price of\nsecurities the Fund\nanticipates purchasing at a later date, or for\nany other purposes, such as for speculation to\nincrease returns. Swaptions are generally\nsubject to the same risks involved in the\nFund\u0092s use of options.\n\nDepending on the terms of the particular\noption agreement, the Fund will generally\nincur a greater degree of risk when it writes\na swaption than it will incur\nwhen it purchases a swaption. When the Fund\npurchases a swaption, it risks losing only the\namount of the premium it has paid should it\ndecide to let the option expire unexercised.\nHowever, when the Fund writes a swaption, upon\nexercise of the option\nthe Fund will become obligated according to\nthe terms of the underlying agreement.\n\nCertain additional risk factors related to\nderivatives are discussed\nbelow:\n\n. Under recently adopted rules by the CFTC,\ntransactions in some types of interest rate\nswaps and index credit default\nswaps on North American and European indices\nare required to be cleared. In addition, the\nCFTC may promulgate additional regulations\nthat require clearing of other classes of\nswaps. In a cleared derivatives transaction\n(which includes commodities\nfutures and cleared swaps transactions), the\nFund\u0092s counterparty is a clearing house (such\nas CME, ICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet),\nrather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund\nis not a member of a clearing house and only\nmembers of a\nclearing house can participate\n\n7\n\ndirectly in the clearing house, the Fund holds\ncleared derivatives through accounts at\nclearing members, who are futures commission\nmerchants that are members of the clearing\nhouses and who have\nthe appropriate regulatory approvals to engage\nin cleared swap transactions. The Fund makes\nand receives payments owed under cleared\nderivatives transactions (including margin\npayments) through its accounts at clearing\nmembers. Clearing members\nguarantee performance of their clients\u0092\nobligations to the clearing house. In contrast\nto bilateral OTC transactions, clearing\nmembers generally can require termination of\nexisting cleared derivatives transactions at\nany time and increases in\nmargin above the margin that it required at\nthe beginning of a transaction. Clearing\nhouses also have broad rights to increase\nmargin requirements for existing transactions\nand to terminate transactions. Any such\nincrease or termination could\ninterfere with the ability of the Fund to\npursue its investment strategy. Also, the Fund\nis subject to execution risk if it enters into\na derivatives transaction that is required to\nbe cleared (or that the Advisor expects to be\ncleared), and no\nclearing member is willing or able to clear\nthe transaction on the Fund\u0092s behalf. While\nthe documentation in place between the Fund\nand its clearing members generally provides\nthat the clearing members will accept for\nclearing all transactions\nsubmitted for clearing that are within credit\nlimits specified by the clearing members in\nadvance, the Fund could be subject to this\nexecution risk if the Fund submits for\nclearing transactions that exceed such credit\nlimits, if the clearing house\ndoes not accept the transactions for clearing,\nor if the clearing members do not comply with\ntheir agreement to clear such transactions. In\nthat case, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of\nany increase in the value of the transaction\nafter the time of the transaction. In\naddition, new regulations could, among other\nthings, restrict the Fund\u0092s ability to engage\nin, or increase the cost to the Fund of,\nderivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund or increasing\nmargin or capital requirements. If the Fund is\nnot able to enter into a particular\nderivatives transaction, the Fund\u0092s investment\nperformance and risk\nprofile could be adversely affected as a\nresult.\n\n. Counterparty risk with respect to OTC\nderivatives may be affected by new\nregulations promulgated by the CFTC and SEC\naffecting the derivatives market. As described\nunder \u0093Derivatives Risk\u0094 above, some\nderivatives transactions are required to be\ncleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives\ntransaction is\nsubject to the credit risk of the clearing\nhouse and the clearing member through which it\nholds its cleared derivatives position, rather\nthan the credit risk of its original\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction.\nClearing members are required\nto segregate all funds received from customers\nwith respect to cleared derivatives\ntransactions from the clearing member\u0092s\nproprietary assets. However, all funds and\nother property received by a clearing broker\nfrom its customers are generally\nheld by the clearing broker on a commingled\nbasis in an omnibus account, which may also\ninvest those funds in certain instruments\npermitted under the applicable regulations.\nAlso, the clearing member transfers to the\nclearing house the amount of\nmargin required by the clearing house for\ncleared derivatives transactions, which\namounts are generally held in the relevant\nomnibus account at the clearing house for all\ncustomers of the clearing member.\n\nFor commodities futures positions, the\nclearing house may use all of the collateral\nheld in the clearing member\u0092s omnibus account\nto meet a loss in that\naccount, without regard to which customer in\nfact supplied that collateral. Accordingly, in\naddition to bearing the credit risk of its\nclearing member, each customer to a futures\ntransaction also bears \u0093fellow customer\u0094 risk\nfrom other\ncustomers of the clearing member. However,\nwith respect to cleared swaps positions,\nrecent regulations promulgated by the CFTC\nrequire that the clearing member notify the\nclearing house of the amount of initial margin\nprovided by the clearing member\nto the clearing house that is attributable to\neach customer. Because margin in respect of\ncleared swaps must be earmarked for specific\nclearing member customers, the clearing house\nmay not use the collateral of one customer to\ncover the obligations\nof another customer. However, if the clearing\nmember does not provide accurate reporting,\nthe Fund is subject to the risk that a\nclearing house will use the Fund\u0092s assets held\nin an omnibus account at the clearing house to\nsatisfy payment\nobligations of a defaulting customer of the\nclearing member to the clearing house. In\naddition, clearing members may generally\nchoose to provide to the clearing house the\nnet amount of variation margin required for\ncleared swaps for all of its\ncustomers in the aggregate, rather than the\ngross amount for each customer.\n\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nThe Fund may take advantage of opportunities\nin the area of options and futures contracts,\noptions on futures contracts, warrants, swaps\nand any other\ninvestments which are not presently\ncontemplated for use by the Fund or which are\nnot currently available but which may be\ndeveloped, to the extent such opportunities\nare both consistent with the Fund\u0092s investment\nobjective and legally\npermissible for the Fund. Before entering into\nsuch transactions or making any such\ninvestment, the Fund will provide appropriate\ndisclosure.\n\nINVESTMENT\nCOMPANIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in the securities of other\ninvestment companies, including affiliated\nfunds and money market funds, subject to\napplicable\nlimitations under Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940\nAct. Pursuant to Section 12(d)(1), the Fund\nmay invest in the securities of another\ninvestment company (the \u0093acquired company\u0094)\nprovided that the Fund, immediately after such\npurchase or acquisition, does not own in the\naggregate: (i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the acquired\ncompany; (ii) securities issued by the\nacquired company having an aggregate value in\nexcess of 5% of the value\nof the total assets of the Fund; or (iii)\nsecurities issued by the acquired company and\nall other investment companies (other than\nTreasury stock of the Fund) having an\naggregate value in excess of 10% of the value\nof the total assets of the\nFund. To the extent allowed by law,\nregulation, the Fund\u0092s investment restrictions\nand the Trust\u0092s exemptive relief, the Fund may\ninvest its assets in securities of investment\ncompanies that are affiliated funds and/or\nmoney market funds\nin excess of the limits discussed above.\n\n8\n\nIf the Fund invests in and, thus, is a\nshareholder of, another investment company,\nthe Fund\u0092s\nshareholders will indirectly bear the Fund\u0092s\nproportionate share of the fees and expenses\npaid by such other investment company,\nincluding advisory fees, in addition to both\nthe management fees payable directly by the\nFund to the Fund\u0092s\nown investment adviser and the other expenses\nthat the Fund bears directly in connection\nwith the Fund\u0092s own operations.\n\nLENDING PORTFOLIO\nSECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may lend portfolio securities to\ncertain creditworthy borrowers in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. markets\nin an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of\nits net assets. The borrowers provide\ncollateral that is marked to market daily in\nan amount at least equal to the current market\nvalue of the securities loaned. The Fund may\nterminate a loan at\nany time and obtain the securities loaned. The\nFund receives the value of any interest or\ncash or non-cash distributions paid on the\nloaned securities. The Fund cannot vote\nproxies for securities on loan, but\nmay recall loans to vote proxies if a material\nissue affecting the Fund\u0092s economic interest\nin the investment is to be voted upon. Efforts\nto recall such securities promptly may be\nunsuccessful, especially for foreign\nsecurities or thinly\ntraded securities, and may involve expenses to\nthe Fund. Distributions received on loaned\nsecurities in lieu of dividend payments (i.e.,\nsubstitute payments) would not be considered\nqualified dividend income.\n\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower will be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. The Fund is\ncompensated by the difference between the\namount earned on the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral and the fee paid to the borrower.\nIn the case of collateral other than cash, the\nFund is compensated by a fee paid by the\nborrower equal to a percentage\nof the market value of the loaned securities.\nAny cash collateral may be reinvested in\ncertain high quality short-term instruments\neither directly on behalf of the Fund or\nthrough one or more joint accounts or funds,\nwhich may include those managed\nby the Adviser. The Fund could lose money due\nto a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or any\ninvestments made with cash collateral. Certain\nnon-cash collateral or investments\nmade with cash collateral may have a greater\nrisk of loss than other non-cash collateral or\ninvestments.\n\nThe Fund\nmay pay a portion of the interest or fees\nearned from securities lending to a borrower\nas described above, and to one or more\nsecurities lending agents approved by the\nBoard of Trustees of the Trust (the \u0093Board\u0094)\nwho administer the lending\nprogram for the Fund in accordance with\nguidelines approved by the Board. In such\ncapacity, the lending agent provides the\nfollowing services to the Fund in connection\nwith the Fund\u0092s securities lending activities:\n(i) locating borrowers\namong an approved list of prospective\nborrowers; (ii) causing the delivery of loaned\nsecurities from the Fund to borrowers; (iii)\nmonitoring the value of loaned securities, the\nvalue of collateral received, and other\nlending parameters;\n(iv) seeking additional collateral, as\nnecessary, from borrowers; (v) receiving and\nholding collateral from borrowers, and\nfacilitating the investment and reinvestment\nof all or substantially all cash collateral in\nan investment vehicle\ndesignated by the Fund; (vi) returning\ncollateral to borrowers; (vii) facilitating\nsubstitute dividend, interest, and other\ndistribution payments to the Fund from\nborrowers; (viii) negotiating the terms of\neach loan of securities,\nincluding but not limited to the amount of any\nloan premium, and monitoring the terms of\nsecurities loan agreements with prospective\nborrowers for consistency with the\nrequirements of the Fund\u0092s Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement;\n(ix) selecting securities, including amounts\n(percentages), to be loaned; (x) recordkeeping\nand accounting servicing; and (xi) arranging\nfor return of loaned securities to the Fund in\naccordance with the terms of the Securities\nLending Authorization Agreement. State Street\nBank and Trust Company (\u0093State Street\u0094), an\naffiliate of the Trust, has been approved by\nthe Board to serve as securities lending agent\nfor the Fund and the Trust has entered into an\nagreement\nwith State Street for such services. Among\nother matters, the Trust has agreed to\nindemnify State Street for certain\nliabilities. State Street has received an\norder of exemption from the SEC under Sections\n17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the 1940 Act to\nserve as the lending agent for affiliated\ninvestment companies such as the Trust and to\ninvest the cash collateral received from loan\ntransactions to be invested in an affiliated\ncash collateral fund.\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and\naccounting process especially so in certain\ninternational markets such as Taiwan), \u0093gap\u0094\nrisk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the\nreturn on cash collateral reinvestments and\nthe fees the Fund has agreed to pay a\nborrower), risk of\nloss of collateral, credit, legal,\ncounterparty and market risk. If a securities\nlending counterparty were to default, the Fund\nwould be subject to the risk of a possible\ndelay in receiving collateral or in recovering\nthe loaned securities, or to a\npossible loss of rights in the collateral. In\nthe event a borrower does not return the\nFund\u0092s securities as agreed, the Fund may\nexperience losses if the proceeds received\nfrom liquidating the collateral do not at\nleast equal the value of the\nloaned security at the time the collateral is\nliquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nAlthough State Street has agreed to provide\nthe Fund with indemnification in the event of\na borrower default, the\nFund is still exposed to the risk of losses in\nthe event a borrower does not return the\nFund\u0092s securities as agreed. For example,\ndelays in recovery of lent securities may\ncause the Fund to lose the opportunity to sell\nthe securities at a\ndesirable price.\n\n9\n\nLEVERAGING\n\nWhile the Fund does not anticipate doing so,\nthe Fund may borrow money in an amount greater\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund\u0092s total\nassets. However,\nunder normal circumstances, the Fund will not\nborrow money from a bank in an amount greater\nthan 10% of the value of the Fund\u0092s total\nassets. Borrowing for investment purposes is\none form of leverage. Leveraging investments,\nby purchasing\nsecurities with borrowed money, is a\nspeculative technique that increases\ninvestment risk, but also increases investment\nopportunity. Because substantially all of the\nFund\u0092s assets will fluctuate in value, whereas\nthe interest obligations\non borrowings may be fixed, the NAV of the\nFund will increase more when the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio assets increase in value and\ndecrease more when the Fund\u0092s portfolio assets\ndecrease in value than would otherwise be the\ncase. Moreover,\ninterest costs on borrowings may fluctuate\nwith changing market rates of interest and may\npartially offset or exceed the returns on the\nborrowed funds.\n\nOTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in short-term\ninstruments, including money market\ninstruments, (including money market funds\nadvised by the Adviser), cash and cash\nequivalents, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by the Adviser); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit (\u0093CDs\u0094),\nbankers\u0092 acceptances, fixed time deposits and\nother obligations of U.S. and foreign banks\n(including foreign branches) and similar\ninstitutions;\n(iv) commercial paper rated at the date of\npurchase \u0093Prime-1\u0094 by Moody\u0092s Investors\nService (\u0093Moody\u0092s\u0094) or \u0093A-1\u0094 by\nStandard & Poor\u0092s (\u0093S&P\u0094), or if unrated, of\ncomparable quality as determined by the\nAdviser; (v) non-convertible corporate debt\nsecurities (e.g., bonds and debentures)\nwith remaining maturities at the date of\npurchase of not more than 397 days and that\npresent minimal credit risks; and (vi) short-\nterm U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of\nforeign banks (including U.S. branches) that,\nin the opinion of the\nAdviser, are of comparable quality to\nobligations of U.S. banks which may be\npurchased by the Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or a\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are\nnon-negotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates. Bankers\u0092 acceptances\nare time drafts drawn on commercial banks by\nborrowers, usually in\nconnection with international transactions.\nMoney market instruments also include shares\nof money market funds. The SEC and other\ngovernment agencies continue to review the\nregulation of money market funds. The SEC has\nadopted changes to the rules\nthat govern money market funds, and compliance\nwith many of these amendments was required in\nOctober 2016. Legislative developments may\nalso affect money market funds. These changes\nand developments may affect the investment\nstrategies, performance,\nyield, operating expenses and continued\nviability of a money market fund.\n\nRATINGS\n\nAn investment-grade rating means the security\nor issuer is rated investment-grade by\nMoody\u0092s, S&P, Fitch, Inc. (\u0093Fitch\u0094), Dominion\nBond\nRating Service Limited, or another credit\nrating agency designated as a nationally\nrecognized statistical rating organization by\nthe SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of\nequivalent quality by the Adviser.\n\nSubsequent to purchase by the Fund, a rated\nsecurity may cease to be rated or its\ninvestment-grade rating may be reduced below\nan investment-grade rating.\nBonds rated lower than Baa3 by Moody\u0092s or BBB-\nby S&P or Fitch are below investment-grade\nquality and are obligations of issuers that\nare considered predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the\nissuer\u0092s capacity to pay interest and repay\nprincipal according to the terms of the\nobligation and, therefore, carry greater\ninvestment risk, including the possibility of\nissuer default and bankruptcy and increased\nmarket price volatility. Such\nsecurities (\u0093lower rated securities\u0094) are\ncommonly referred to as \u0093junk bonds\u0094 and are\nsubject to a substantial degree of credit\nrisk. Lower rated securities are often issued\nby smaller, less creditworthy companies or by\nhighly\nleveraged (indebted) firms, which are\ngenerally less able than more financially\nstable firms to make scheduled payments of\ninterest and principal. The risks posed by\nsecurities issued under such circumstances are\nsubstantial. Bonds rated below\ninvestment-grade tend to be less marketable\nthan higher-quality bonds because the market\nfor them is less broad. The market for unrated\nbonds is even narrower.\n\nREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in repurchase\nagreements with commercial banks, brokers or\ndealers to generate income from its excess\ncash balances and to invest securities lending\ncash collateral. A repurchase agreement is an\nagreement under which the Fund acquires a\nfinancial instrument\n(e.g., a security issued by the U.S.\ngovernment or an agency thereof, a banker\u0092s\nacceptance or a certificate of deposit) from a\nseller, subject to resale to the seller at an\nagreed upon price and date (normally, the next\nBusiness Day\n\u0096 as defined below). A repurchase agreement\nmay be considered a loan collateralized by\nsecurities. The resale price reflects an\nagreed upon interest rate effective for the\nperiod the instrument is held by the Fund and\nis unrelated to the\ninterest rate on the underlying instrument.\n\nIn these repurchase agreement transactions,\nthe securities acquired by the Fund (including\naccrued interest\nearned thereon) must have a total value in\nexcess of the value of the repurchase\nagreement and are held by the Custodian until\nrepurchased. No more than an aggregate of 15%\nof the Fund\u0092s net assets will be invested in\nilliquid securities,\nincluding repurchase agreements having\nmaturities longer than seven days and\nsecurities subject to legal or contractual\nrestrictions on resale, or for which there are\nno readily available market quotations.\n\n10\n\nThe use of repurchase agreements involves\ncertain risks. For example, if the other party\nto the agreement\ndefaults on its obligation to repurchase the\nunderlying security at a time when the value\nof the security has declined, the Fund may\nincur a loss upon disposition of the security.\nIf the other party to the agreement becomes\ninsolvent and subject to\nliquidation or reorganization under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or other laws, a court may\ndetermine that the underlying security is\ncollateral for a loan by the Fund not within\nthe control of the Fund and, therefore, the\nFund may not be able to\nsubstantiate its interest in the underlying\nsecurity and may be deemed an unsecured\ncreditor of the other party to the agreement.\n\nREVERSE REPURCHASE\nAGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements, which involve the sale of\nsecurities with an agreement to repurchase the\nsecurities at\nan agreed-upon price, date and interest\npayment and have the characteristics of\nborrowing. The securities purchased with the\nfunds obtained from the agreement and\nsecurities collateralizing the agreement will\nhave maturity dates no later than the\nrepayment date. Generally the effect of such\ntransactions is that the Fund can recover all\nor most of the cash invested in the portfolio\nsecurities involved during the term of the\nreverse repurchase agreement, while in many\ncases the Fund is able to\nkeep some of the interest income associated\nwith those securities. Such transactions are\nonly advantageous if the Fund has an\nopportunity to earn a greater rate of interest\non the cash derived from these transactions\nthan the interest cost of\nobtaining the same amount of cash.\nOpportunities to realize earnings from the use\nof the proceeds equal to or greater than the\ninterest required to be paid may not always be\navailable and the Fund intends to use the\nreverse repurchase technique only\nwhen the Adviser believes it will be\nadvantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse\nrepurchase agreements may exaggerate any\ninterim increase or decrease in the value of\nthe Fund\u0092s assets. The Fund\u0092s exposure to\nreverse repurchase agreements\nwill be covered by securities having a value\nequal to or greater than such commitments.\nUnder the 1940 Act, reverse repurchase\nagreements are considered borrowings. Although\nthere is no percentage limit on Fund assets\nthat can be used in connection\nwith reverse repurchase agreements, the Fund\ndoes not expect to engage, under normal\ncircumstances, in reverse repurchase\nagreements with respect to more than 10% of\nits total assets.\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nU.S. Government obligations are a\ntype of bond. U.S. Government obligations\ninclude securities issued or guaranteed as to\nprincipal and interest by the U.S. Government,\nits agencies or instrumentalities.\n\nOne type of U.S. Government obligation, U.S.\nTreasury obligations, are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. Treasury and\ndiffer only in their\ninterest rates, maturities, and times of\nissuance. U.S. Treasury bills have initial\nmaturities of one-year or less; U.S. Treasury\nnotes have initial maturities of one to ten\nyears; and U.S. Treasury bonds\ngenerally have initial maturities of greater\nthan ten years.\n\nOther U.S. Government obligations are issued\nor guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities\nof the U.S. Government including, but not\nlimited to, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u0093Fannie Mae\u0094), the Government\nNational Mortgage Association (\u0093Ginnie Mae\u0094),\nthe Small Business Administration, the Federal\nFarm Credit\nAdministration, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage\nCorporation (\u0093Freddie Mac\u0094), the Federal Home\nLoan Banks (\u0093FHLB\u0094), Banks for Cooperatives\n(including the Central Bank for Cooperatives),\nthe Federal Land Banks, the Federal\nIntermediate Credit Banks, the Tennessee\nValley Authority, the Export-Import Bank of\nthe United States, the Commodity Credit\nCorporation, the Federal Financing Bank, the\nStudent Loan Marketing Association, the\nNational Credit Union Administration\nand the Federal Agricultural Mortgage\nCorporation (Farmer Mac). Some obligations\nissued or guaranteed by U.S. Government\nagencies and instrumentalities, including, for\nexample, Ginnie Mae pass-through certificates,\nare supported by the full faith\nand credit of the U.S. Treasury. Other\nobligations issued by or guaranteed by federal\nagencies, such as those securities issued by\nFannie Mae, are supported by the discretionary\nauthority of the U.S. Government to purchase\ncertain obligations of the\nfederal agency, while other obligations issued\nby or guaranteed by federal agencies, such as\nthose of the Federal Home Loan Banks, are\nsupported by the right of the issuer to borrow\nfrom the U.S. Treasury. While the U.S.\nGovernment provides\nfinancial support to such U.S. Government-\nsponsored federal agencies, no assurance can\nbe given that the U.S. Government will always\ndo so, since the U.S. Government is not so\nobligated by law.\n\nIn September 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced\na federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac, placing the two federal instrumentalities\nin conservatorship.\nUnder the terms of the takeover, the U.S.\nTreasury agreed to acquire $1 billion of\nsenior preferred stock of each instrumentality\nand obtained warrants for the purchase of\ncommon stock of each instrumentality. Under\nthese Senior Preferred Stock\nPurchase Agreements (\u0093SPAs\u0094), the U.S.\nTreasury has pledged to provide a limited\namount of capital per instrumentality as\nneeded, including the contribution of cash\ncapital to the instrumentalities in the event\ntheir liabilities exceed\ntheir assets. In May 2009, the U.S. Treasury\nincreased its maximum commitment to each\ninstrumentality under the SPAs from $100\nbillion to $200 billion per instrumentality.\nIn December 2009, the U.S. Treasury amended\nthe SPAs to provide\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac with some\nadditional flexibility to meet the requirement\nto reduce their mortgage portfolios. Also in\nDecember 2009, the U.S.\n\n11\n\nTreasury further amended the SPAs to allow the\ncap on the U.S. Treasury\u0092s funding commitment\nto\nincrease as necessary to accommodate any\ncumulative reduction in Fannie Mae\u0092s and\nFreddie Mac\u0092s net worth through the end of\n2012. On August 17, 2012, the U.S. Treasury\nannounced that it was again amending the SPAs\nto terminate the\nrequirement that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\neach pay a 10% dividend annually on all\namounts received under the funding commitment.\nInstead, they were required to transfer to the\nU.S. Treasury on a quarterly basis all profits\nearned during a quarter\nthat exceeded a capital reserve amount of $3\nbillion. On September 30, 2019, the U.S.\nTreasury announced amendments to the SPAs\npermitting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to\nmaintain capital reserves of $25 billion and\n$20 billion,\nrespectively. It is believed that the\namendment puts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a\nbetter position to service their debt because\nthe companies no longer have to borrow from\nthe U.S. Treasury to make fixed dividend\npayments.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the subject of\nseveral continuing class action lawsuits and\ninvestigations by federal regulators over\ncertain accounting,\ndisclosure or corporate governance matters,\nwhich (along with any resulting financial\nrestatements) may adversely affect the\nguaranteeing entities. Importantly, the future\nof the entities is in serious question as the\nU.S. government reportedly is\nconsidering multiple options, ranging from\nnationalization, privatization, consolidation,\nor abolishment of the entities.\n\nVARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE\nSECURITIES\n\nVariable rate securities are instruments\nissued or guaranteed by entities such as (1)\nUS Government, or an agency or instrumentality\nthereof, (2) states, municipalities and other\npolitical subdivisions, agencies, authorities\nand instrumentalities or states and multi-\nstate agencies or authorities (3)\ncorporations, (4) financial institutions, (5)\ninsurance\ncompanies or (6) trusts that have a rate of\ninterest subject to adjustment at regular\nintervals but less frequently than annually. A\nvariable rate security provides for the\nautomatic establishment of a new interest rate\non set dates. Variable\nrate obligations whose interest is readjusted\nno less frequently than annually will be\ndeemed to have a maturity equal to the period\nremaining until the next readjustment of the\ninterest rate. The Fund may also purchase\nfloating rate securities. A\nfloating rate security provides for the\nautomatic adjustment of its interest rate\nwhenever a specified interest rate changes.\nInterest rates on these securities are\nordinarily tied to, and are a percentage of, a\nwidely recognized interest rate, such\nas the yield on 90-day US Treasury bills or\nthe prime rate of a specified bank. These\nrates may change as often as twice daily.\nGenerally, changes in interest rates will have\na smaller effect on the market\nvalue of variable and fixed rate floating rate\nsecurities than on the market value of\ncomparable fixed rate fixed income\nobligations. Thus, investing in variable and\nfixed rate floating rate securities generally\nallows less opportunity for capital\nappreciation and depreciation than investing\nin comparable fixed rate fixed income\nsecurities.\n\nWHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may purchase securities on a when-\nissued basis. Delivery of and payment for\nthese securities may take place as long as a\nmonth or more after the date\nof the purchase commitment. The value of these\nsecurities is subject to market fluctuation\nduring this period, and no income accrues to\nthe Fund until settlement takes place. When\nentering into a when-issued transaction, the\nFund will rely on the\nother party to consummate the transaction; if\nthe other party fails to do so, the Fund may\nbe disadvantaged.\n\nSecurities purchased on a when-issued basis\nand held by the Fund are subject to changes in\nmarket value based upon actual or perceived\nchanges in the level of interest rates.\nGenerally, the value of such securities will\nfluctuate inversely to changes in interest\nrates \u0097 i.e., they\nwill appreciate in value when interest rates\ndecline and decrease in value when interest\nrates rise. Therefore, if the Fund purchases\nsecurities on a when-issued basis, there may\nbe a greater possibility of fluctuation in the\nFund\u0092s NAV.\n\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS\n\nA discussion of the risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. The discussion below supplements,\nand should be read in\nconjunction with, the Prospectus.\n\nGENERAL\n\nInvestment in\nthe Fund should be made with an understanding\nthat the value of the Fund\u0092s portfolio\nsecurities may fluctuate in accordance with\nchanges in the financial condition of the\nissuers of the portfolio securities, the value\nof securities generally\nand other factors.\n\nAn investment in the Fund should also be made\nwith an understanding of the risks inherent in\nan investment in securities, including\nthe risk that the financial condition of\nissuers may become impaired or that the\ngeneral condition of the securities markets\nmay deteriorate (either of which may cause a\ndecrease in the value of the portfolio\nsecurities and thus in the value of\nShares). Securities are susceptible to general\nmarket fluctuations and to volatile increases\nand decreases in value as market confidence in\nand perceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable\nfactors including expectations regarding\n\n12\n\ngovernment, economic, monetary and fiscal\npolicies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic and banking\ncrises. Securities of\nissuers traded on exchanges may be suspended\non certain exchanges by the issuers\nthemselves, by an exchange or by government\nauthorities. The likelihood of such\nsuspensions may be higher for securities of\nissuers in emerging or less-developed market\ncountries than in countries with more\ndeveloped markets. Trading suspensions may be\napplied from time to time to the securities of\nindividual issuers for reasons specific to\nthat issuer, or may be applied broadly by\nexchanges or governmental\nauthorities in response to market events.\nSuspensions may last for significant periods\nof time, during which trading in the\nsecurities and instruments that reference the\nsecurities, such as participatory notes (or\n\u0093P-notes\u0094) or other derivative instruments,\nmay be halted.\n\nHolders of common stock incur more risk than\nholders of preferred stocks and debt\nobligations because common stockholders, as\nowners of the issuer, have generally inferior\nrights to receive payments from the issuer in\ncomparison with the rights of creditors of, or\nholders of debt obligations\nor preferred stocks issued by, the issuer.\nFurther, unlike debt securities which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (whose value, however,\nwill be subject to market fluctuations prior\nthereto), or preferred stocks which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stock have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity. Common stock values are subject to\nmarket fluctuations as long as the\ncommon stock remains outstanding.\n\nThe principal trading market for some of the\nsecurities in the Index may be in the over-\nthe-counter market. The existence of a liquid\ntrading market for certain securities may\ndepend on whether dealers will make a market\nin such securities. There can be no assurance\nthat a market will be\nmade or maintained or that any such market\nwill be or remain liquid. The price at which\nsecurities may be sold and the value of the\nFund\u0092s Shares will be adversely affected if\ntrading markets for the Fund\u0092s portfolio\nsecurities are limited\nor absent or if bid/ask spreads are wide.\n\nBREXIT RISK\n\nIn\nJune 2016, citizens of the United Kingdom\nvoted in a referendum to leave the EU (known\nas \u0093Brexit\u0094), creating economic and political\nuncertainty in its wake. In March 2017, the\nUnited Kingdom formally notified the European\nCouncil of the\nUnited Kingdom\u0092s intention to withdraw from\nthe EU pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union. This formal notification began\na multi-year period of negotiations regarding\nthe terms of the United Kingdom\u0092s exit from\nthe EU,\nwhich formally concluded on January 31, 2020.\nThe United Kingdom is currently in a\ntransition period where it remains subject to\nEU rules but has no role in the EU lawmaking\nprocess. During this transition period, United\nKingdom and EU\nrepresentatives are negotiating the precise\nterms of their future relationship. The\ntransition period is scheduled to end on\nDecember 31, 2020. The full scope and nature\nof the consequences of the exit are not at\nthis time known and are\nunlikely to be known for a significant period\nof time. It is also unknown whether the United\nKingdom\u0092s exit will increase the likelihood of\nother countries also departing the EU. Any\nexits from the EU, or the possibility of such\nexits, may have\na significant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could\npotentially have an adverse effect on the\nvalue of the Fund\u0092s investments.\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK\n\nAn investment in the Fund may be subject to a\nnumber of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest. For example, the Adviser or its\naffiliates may provide\nservices to the Fund, such as securities\nlending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting\nservices, transfer agency and shareholder\nservicing, securities brokerage services, and\nother services for which the Fund would\ncompensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates.\nThe Fund may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise\naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no\nassurance that the rates at which the Fund\npays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates, will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser makes\navailable to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nmay have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of the\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest.\n\nCONTINUOUS OFFERING\n\nThe method by which Creation Units of\nShares are created and traded may raise\ncertain issues under applicable securities\nlaws. Because new Creation Units of Shares are\nissued and sold by the Trust on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u0093distribution,\u0094 as such\nterm is used in the\nSecurities Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nwhich could render them\nstatutory underwriters and subject them to the\nprospectus delivery and liability provisions\nof the Securities Act.\n\n13\n\nFor example, a broker-dealer firm or its\nclient may be deemed a statutory underwriter\nif it takes Creation\nUnits after placing an order with the\nDistributor, breaks them down into constituent\nShares, and sells such Shares directly to\ncustomers, or if it chooses to couple\n\nthe creation of a supply of new Shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for Shares. A\ndetermination of whether\none is an underwriter for purposes of the\nSecurities Act must take into account all the\nfacts and circumstances pertaining to the\nactivities of the broker-dealer or its client\nin the particular case, and the examples\nmentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter.\n\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u0093underwriters\u0094 but are\neffecting transactions in Shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nShares, are generally required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in\nSection 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act is not\navailable in respect of such transactions as a\nresult of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms\nthat incur a prospectus-delivery obligation\nwith respect to Shares of the Fund are\nreminded\nthat under Securities Act Rule 153, a\nprospectus-delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the Securities Act owed to an\nexchange member in connection with a sale on\nthe Exchange is satisfied by the fact that the\nFund\u0092s Prospectus is\navailable at the Exchange upon request. The\nprospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule\n153 is only available with respect to\ntransactions on an exchange.\n\nSSGA or its affiliates (the \u0093Selling\nShareholder\u0094) may purchase Creation Units\nthrough a broker-dealer to \u0093seed\u0094 (in whole or\nin part) the\nFund as it is launched, or may purchase shares\nfrom broker-dealers or other investors that\nhave previously provided \u0093seed\u0094 for the Fund\nwhen it was launched or otherwise in secondary\nmarket transactions, and because the Selling\nShareholder\nmay be deemed an affiliate of the Fund, the\nShares are being registered to permit the\nresale of these shares from time to time after\npurchase. The Fund will not receive any of the\nproceeds from the resale by the Selling\nShareholders of these Shares.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder intends to sell all or\na portion of the Shares owned by it and\noffered hereby from time to time directly or\nthrough one or more\nbroker-dealers, and may also hedge such\npositions. The Shares may be sold on any\nnational securities exchange on which the\nShares may be listed or quoted at the time of\nsale, in the\nover-the-counter market or in transactions\nother than on these exchanges or systems at\nfixed prices, at prevailing market prices at\nthe time of the sale, at varying\nprices determined at the time of sale, or at\nnegotiated prices. These sales may be effected\nin transactions, which may involve cross or\nblock transactions.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder may also loan or\npledge Shares to broker-dealers that in turn\nmay sell such Shares, to the extent permitted\nby applicable law. The\nSelling Shareholder may also enter into\noptions or other transactions with broker-\ndealers or other financial institutions or the\ncreation of one or more derivative securities\nwhich require the delivery to such broker-\ndealer or other financial\ninstitution of Shares, which Shares such\nbroker-dealer or other financial institution\nmay resell.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer\nor agents\nparticipating in the distribution of Shares\nmay be deemed to be \u0093underwriters\u0094 within the\nmeaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act\nin connection with such sales. In such event,\nany commissions paid to any such broker-dealer\nor\nagent and any profit on the resale of the\nShares purchased by them may be deemed to be\nunderwriting commissions or discounts under\nthe Securities Act. The Selling Shareholder\nwho may be deemed an \u0093underwriter\u0094 within the\nmeaning of\nSection 2(11) of the Securities Act will be\nsubject to the applicable prospectus delivery\nrequirements of the Securities Act.\n\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK\n\nCounterparty risk with respect to derivatives\nhas been and may continue to be affected by\nnew rules and regulations affecting the\nderivatives market. Some\nderivatives transactions are required to be\ncentrally cleared, and a party to a cleared\nderivatives transaction is subject to the\ncredit risk of the clearing house and the\nclearing member through which it holds its\ncleared position, rather than the\ncredit risk of its original counterparty to\nthe derivatives transaction. Credit risk of\nmarket participants with respect to\nderivatives that are centrally cleared is\nconcentrated in a few clearing houses, and it\nis not clear how an insolvency\nproceeding of a clearing house would be\nconducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by the\nFund, and what impact an insolvency of a\nclearing house would have on the financial\nsystem more generally.\n\nFUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS\n\nThere can be no assurance that\na liquid secondary market will exist for any\nparticular futures contract or option at any\nspecific time. Thus, it may not be possible to\nclose a futures or options position. In the\nevent of adverse price movements, the Fund\nwould continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if the Fund has insufficient cash,\nit may have to sell portfolio securities to\nmeet daily margin requirements at a time when\nit may be disadvantageous to do\nso. In addition, the Fund may be required to\nmake delivery of the instruments underlying\nfutures contracts it has sold.\n\nThe Fund will minimize the risk\nthat it will be unable to close out a futures\nor options contract by only entering into\nfutures and options for which there appears to\nbe a liquid secondary market.\n\n14\n\nThe risk of loss in trading futures contracts\nor uncovered call options in some strategies\n(e.g.,\nselling uncovered index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts, when\navailable, in this manner. The risk of a\nfutures position may still be large as\ntraditionally measured due to the\nlow margin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, may\nutilize futures and options contracts in a\nmanner designed to limit its risk exposure to\nthat which is comparable to what it would have\nincurred through direct investment in\nsecurities.\n\nUtilization of futures transactions by the\nFund involves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to its benchmark Index if\nthe index underlying the\nfutures contracts differs from the benchmark\nIndex or if the futures contracts do not track\nthe benchmark Index as expected. There is also\nthe risk of loss by the Fund of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom the Fund has\nan open position in the futures contract or\noption.\n\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount that the\nprice of a futures contract may vary either up\nor down from the previous day\u0092s settlement\nprice at the end of a trading session. Once\nthe daily limit\nhas been reached in a particular type of\ncontract, no trades may be made on that day at\na price beyond that limit. The daily limit\ngoverns only price movement during a\nparticular trading day and therefore does not\nlimit potential losses, because the\nlimit may prevent the liquidation of\nunfavorable positions. Futures contract prices\nhave occasionally moved to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions\nand subjecting some futures traders to\nsubstantial losses.\n\nRISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nSwap agreements are subject to the risk that\nthe swap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, the\nFund will have contractual\nremedies pursuant to the agreements related to\nthe transaction, but such remedies may be\nsubject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws\nwhich could affect the Fund\u0092s rights as a\ncreditor.\n\nThe use of interest-rate and index swaps is a\nhighly specialized activity that involves\ninvestment techniques and risks different from\nthose associated with\nordinary portfolio security transactions. The\nuse of a swap requires an understanding not\nonly of the referenced asset, reference rate\nor index but also of the swap itself, without\nthe benefit of observing the performance of\nthe swap under all\npossible market conditions. These transactions\ngenerally do not involve the delivery of\nsecurities or other underlying assets or\nprincipal.\n\nThe absence\nof a regulated execution facility or contract\nmarket and lack of liquidity for swap\ntransactions has led, in some instances, to\ndifficulties in trading and valuation,\nespecially in the event of market disruptions.\nUnder recently adopted rules and\nregulations, transactions in some types of\nswaps are required to be centrally cleared. In\na cleared derivatives transaction, the Fund\u0092s\ncounterparty to the transaction is a central\nderivatives clearing organization, or clearing\nhouse, rather\nthan a bank or broker. Because the Fund is not\na member of a clearing house, and only members\nof a clearing house can participate directly\nin the clearing house, the Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers. In cleared\nderivatives transactions, the Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and\nreceive payments from a clearing house through\nits accounts at clearing members. Clearing\nmembers guarantee performance of their\nclients\u0092 obligations to\nthe clearing house. Centrally cleared\nderivative arrangements may be less favorable\nto the Fund than bilateral (non-cleared)\narrangements. For example, the Fund may be\nrequired to provide greater amounts of\nmargin for cleared derivatives transactions\nthan for bilateral derivatives transactions.\nAlso, in contrast to bilateral derivatives\ntransactions, in some cases following a period\nof notice to the Fund, a clearing member\ngenerally can require\ntermination of existing cleared derivatives\ntransactions at any time or an increase in\nmargin requirements above the margin that the\nclearing member required at the beginning of a\ntransaction. Clearing houses also have broad\nrights to increase\nmargin requirements for existing transactions\nor to terminate transactions at any time. The\nFund is subject to risk if it enters into a\nderivatives transaction that is required to be\ncleared (or which SSGA FM expects to be\ncleared), and no clearing\nmember is willing or able to clear the\ntransaction on the Fund\u0092s behalf. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of the transaction,\nincluding loss of an increase in the\nvalue of the transaction and loss of hedging\nprotection. In addition, the documentation\ngoverning the relationship between the Fund\nand clearing members is drafted by the\nclearing members and generally is less\nfavorable to the Fund than typical\nbilateral derivatives documentation.\n\nThese clearing rules and other new rules and\nregulations could, among other things,\nrestrict the Fund\u0092s ability\nto engage in, or increase the cost to the Fund\nof, derivatives transactions, for example, by\nmaking some types of derivatives no longer\navailable to the Fund, increasing margin or\ncapital requirements, or otherwise limiting\nliquidity or increasing\ntransaction costs. These regulations are new\nand evolving, so their potential impact on the\nFund and the financial system are not yet\nknown.\n\nBecause they\nare two party contracts that may be subject to\ncontractual restrictions on transferability\nand termination and because they may have\nterms of greater than seven days, swap\nagreements may be considered to be illiquid\nand subject to the Fund\u0092s\nlimitation on investments in illiquid\nsecurities. To the extent that a swap is not\nliquid, it may not be possible to initiate a\ntransaction or liquidate a position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result\nin significant losses. Like most\nother investments, swap agreements are subject\nto the risk that the market value of the\ninstrument will change in a way detrimental to\nthe Fund\u0092s interest.\n\n15\n\nIf the Fund uses a swap as a hedge against, or\nas a substitute for, a portfolio investment,\nthe Fund will be\nexposed to the risk that the swap will have or\nwill develop imperfect or no correlation with\nthe portfolio investment. This could cause\nsubstantial losses for the Fund. While hedging\nstrategies involving swap instruments can\nreduce the risk of loss,\nthey can also reduce the opportunity for gain\nor even result in losses by offsetting\nfavorable price movements in other Fund\ninvestments. Many swaps are complex and often\nvalued subjectively.\n\nLIBOR RISK\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u0092s\nFinancial Conduct Authority, which regulates\nLIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out\nLIBOR by the end of 2021. The replacement or\nabandonment of, or modification to, LIBOR\ncould have adverse impacts on newly issued\nfinancial instruments and\nexisting financial instruments which reference\nLIBOR. While some instruments may contemplate\na scenario where LIBOR is no longer available\nby providing for an alternative rate setting\nmethodology, not all instruments may have such\nprovisions and\nthere are significant uncertainty regarding\nthe effectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies. Abandonment of or modifications\nto LIBOR could lead to significant short-term\nand long-term uncertainty and market\ninstability. Instruments in which\nthe Fund invests may pay interest at floating\nor adjusting rates based on LIBOR or may be\nsubject to interest caps or floors. There\nremains uncertainty regarding the future\nutilization of LIBOR and the nature of any\nreplacement rate. The\nunavailability or replacement of LIBOR may\naffect the value, liquidity or return on\ncertain Fund investments and may result in\ncosts incurred in connection with closing out\npositions and entering into new trades. Any\npricing adjustments to the\nFund\u0092s investments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect the\nFund\u0092s performance and/or NAV. Such successor\nor substitute reference rate and any\nadjustments selected may negatively impact the\nFund\u0092s\ninvestments, performance or financial\ncondition, and may expose the Fund to\nadditional tax, accounting and regulatory\nrisks, Additionally, if LIBOR ceases to exist,\nthe Fund may need to renegotiate the credit\nagreements extending beyond 2021 with\nthe Fund\u0092s obligors that utilize LIBOR as a\nfactor in determining the interest rate and\ncertain of the Fund\u0092s existing credit\nfacilities to replace LIBOR with the new\nstandard that is established. Any pricing\nadjustments to the Fund\u0092s\ninvestments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect the\nFund\u0092s performance and/or NAV. Such successor\nor substitute reference rate and any\nadjustments selected may negatively impact the\nFund\u0092s investments,\nperformance or financial condition, and may\nexpose the Fund to additional tax, accounting\nand regulatory risks.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction\nwith the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee, a steering committee comprised of\nlarge U.S. financial institutions, intends to\nreplace the U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR), a new index\ncalculated by short-term\nrepurchase agreements, backed by Treasury\nsecurities. Abandonment of or modifications to\nLIBOR could have adverse impacts on newly\nissued financial instruments and existing\nfinancial instruments which reference LIBOR.\nWhile some instruments may\ncontemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no\nlonger available by providing for an\nalternative rate setting methodology, not all\ninstruments may have such provisions and there\nare significant uncertainty regarding the\neffectiveness of any such\nalternative methodologies.\n\nIn 2012, regulators in the United States and\nthe United Kingdom alleged that some of the\nmember banks surveyed by the British\nBankers Association engaged in manipulative\nacts in connection with the calculation of\nLIBOR. Several financial institutions have\nreached settlements with the CFTC, the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice Fraud Section and the\nUnited Kingdom Financial\nConduct Authority in connection with\ninvestigations by such authorities into\nsubmissions made by such financial\ninstitutions to the bodies that set LIBOR and\nother interbank offered rates. Additional\ninvestigations remain ongoing with respect to\nother major banks. Despite increased\nregulation and other corrective actions since\nthat time, concerns have arisen regarding\nLIBOR\u0092s viability as a benchmark, due to\ndecreased confidence of the market in LIBOR\nand lead market participants\nlooking for alternative, non-LIBOR based types\nof financing, such as fixed rate loans or\nbonds or floating rate loans based on non-\nLIBOR indices.\n\nMARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING FROM COVID-19\n\nAn outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by\na novel coronavirus first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has spread globally in a short\nperiod of time. In\nan organized attempt to contain and mitigate\nthe effects of the spread of the coronavirus\nknown as COVID-19, governments and businesses\nworld-wide have taken aggressive measures,\nincluding closing borders,\nrestricting international and domestic travel,\nand the imposition of prolonged quarantines of\nlarge populations. COVID-19 has resulted in\nthe disruption of and delays in the delivery\nof healthcare services and\nprocesses, the cancellation of organized\nevents and educational institutions, the\ndisruption of production and supply chains, a\ndecline in consumer demand for certain goods\nand services, and general concern and\nuncertainty, all of which have\ncontributed to increased volatility in global\nmarkets. The effects of COVID-19 will likely\naffect certain sectors and industries more\ndramatically than others, which may adversely\naffect the value of the\nFund\u0092s investments in those sectors or\nindustries. COVID-19, and other epidemics and\npandemics that may arise in the future, could\nadversely affect the economies of many\nnations, the global economy,\nindividual companies and capital markets in\nways that cannot be foreseen at the present\ntime. In addition, the impact of infectious\ndiseases in developing or emerging market\ncountries may be greater due to limited health\ncare resources. Political,\neconomic and social stresses caused by\nCOVID-19 also may exacerbate other pre-\nexisting political, social and economic risks\nin certain countries. The duration of COVID-19\nand its effects cannot be determined at this\ntime, but the effects could be present for an\nextended period of time.\n\n16\n\nTAX RISKS\n\nAs\nwith any investment, you should consider how\nyour investment in Shares of the Fund will be\ntaxed. The tax information in the Prospectus\nand this SAI is provided as general\ninformation. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax\nconsequences of an investment in Shares of the\nFund.\n\nUnless your investment in Shares is made\nthrough a\ntax-advantaged retirement account, such as an\nindividual retirement account, you need to be\naware of the possible tax consequences when\nthe Fund makes distributions or you sell\nShares.\n\nINVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe Trust has adopted the following investment\nrestrictions as fundamental policies with\nrespect to the Fund. These restrictions cannot\nbe changed without the\napproval of the holders of a majority of the\nFund\u0092s outstanding voting securities. For\npurposes of the 1940 Act, a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund\nmeans the vote, at an annual or a special\nmeeting of the security\nholders of the Trust, of the lesser of (1) 67%\nor more of the voting securities of the Fund\npresent at such meeting, if the holders of\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund are present or\nrepresented by proxy, or\n(2) more than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund. Except with the\napproval of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities, the Fund may not:\n\n1. Concentrate its investments in securities\nof issuers in the same industry, except as may\nbe necessary to approximate the composition of\nthe Fund\u0092s\nunderlying Index;\n\n2. Make loans to another person except as\npermitted by the 1940 Act or other\ngoverning statute, by the Rules thereunder, or\nby the SEC or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund;\n\n3. Issue senior securities or borrow\nmoney except as permitted by the 1940 Act or\nother governing statute, by the Rules\nthereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory\nagency with authority over the Fund;\n\n4. Invest directly in real estate unless the\nreal estate is acquired as a result of\nownership of securities or other instruments.\nThis restriction shall not\npreclude the Fund from investing in companies\nthat deal in real estate or in instruments\nthat are backed or secured by real estate;\n\n5. Act as an\nunderwriter of another issuer\u0092s securities,\nexcept to the extent the Fund may be deemed to\nbe an underwriter within the meaning of the\nSecurities Act in connection with the Fund\u0092s\npurchase and sale of portfolio securities; or\n\n6. Invest in commodities except as permitted\nby the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other\nregulatory agency\nwith authority over the Fund.\n\nIn addition to the investment restrictions\nadopted as fundamental policies as set forth\nabove, the Fund observes the\nfollowing restrictions, which may be changed\nby the Board without a shareholder vote. The\nFund will not:\n\n1. Invest in the securities of a company for\nthe\npurpose of exercising management or control,\nprovided that the Trust may vote the\ninvestment securities owned by the Fund in\naccordance with its views;\n\n2. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its total assets in securities\nthat comprise the benchmark Index. Securities\nthat have economic\ncharacteristics substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities\nthat comprise the Index are included within\nthis 80% investment policy; and\n\n3. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of\nborrowings for investment purposes, in U.S.\nTreasury bills. Prior to\nany change in the Fund\u0092s 80% investment\npolicy, the Fund will provide shareholders\nwith 60 days written notice.\n\nThe Fund defines the foregoing terms\nin accordance with the definition of such\nterms per the Index. If a percentage\nlimitation is adhered to at the time of\ninvestment or contract, a later increase or\ndecrease in percentage resulting from any\nchange in value or total or net assets will\nnot result in a violation of such restriction,\nexcept that the percentage limitations with\nrespect to the borrowing of money will be\nobserved continuously. With respect to the\nlimitation on borrowing, in the event that a\nsubsequent change in net\nassets or other circumstances cause the Fund\nto exceed its limitation, the Fund will take\nsteps to bring the aggregate amount of\nborrowing back within the limitations within\nthree days thereafter (not including Sundays\nand holidays).\n                                              \n     The SEC Staff considers concentration    \n  1  to involve more than 25% of a fund\u0092s      \n     assets to be invested in an              \n     industry or group of industries.         \n                                              \n17\n\nThe 1940 Act currently permits the Fund to\nloan up to 33 1/3% of its total assets. With\nrespect to\nborrowing, the 1940 Act presently allows the\nFund to: (1) borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets)\nin an amount up to 33 /% of its total assets,\n(2) borrow money for temporary purposes in an\namount not exceeding 5% of the value of the\nFund\u0092s total assets at the time of the loan,\nand (3) enter into\nreverse repurchase agreements. However, under\nnormal circumstances any borrowings by the\nFund will not exceed 10% of the Fund\u0092s total\nassets. The 1940 Act generally prohibits funds\nfrom issuing senior securities, although it\ndoes not treat\ncertain transactions as senior securities,\nsuch as certain borrowings, short sales,\nreverse repurchase agreements, firm commitment\nagreements and standby commitments, with\nappropriate earmarking or segregation of\nassets to cover such obligation.\nWith respect to investments in commodities,\nthe 1940 Act presently permits the Fund to\ninvest in commodities in accordance with\ninvestment policies contained in its\nprospectus and SAI. Any such investment shall\nalso comply with the CEA and the rules\nand regulations thereunder. The 1940 Act does\nnot directly restrict an investment company\u0092s\nability to invest in real estate, but does\nrequire that every investment company have the\nfundamental investment policy governing such\ninvestments. The\nFund will not purchase or sell real estate,\nexcept that the Fund may invest in companies\nthat deal in real estate (including real\nestate investment trusts (\u0093REITs\u0094)) or in\ninstruments that are backed or secured by real\nestate.\n\nEXCHANGE LISTING AND TRADING\n\nA discussion of exchange listing and trading\nmatters associated with an investment in the\nFund is contained in the Prospectus under\n\u0093PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION\u0094 and \u0093ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION.\u0094 The discussion below\nsupplements, and should be read in conjunction\nwith, such sections of the Prospectus.\n\nThe Shares of the Fund are approved for\nlisting and trading on the Exchange, subject\nto notice of issuance. The Shares trade on the\nExchange at prices that\nmay differ to some degree from their net asset\nvalue. There can be no assurance that the\nrequirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of Shares of the Fund\nwill continue to be met.\n\nThe Exchange may consider the suspension of\ntrading in, and may initiate delisting\nproceedings of, the Shares of the Fund under\nany of the following\ncircumstances: (i) if any of the continued\nlisting requirements set forth in the Exchange\nrules are not continuously maintained; (ii) if\nthe Exchange files separate proposals under\nSection 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934,\nas amended, and any of the statements or\nrepresentations regarding (a) the description\nof the Index, portfolio, or reference asset;\n(b) limitations on the Index or the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio holdings or reference assets; or (c)\nthe\napplicability of the Exchange listing rules\nspecified in such proposals are not\ncontinuously maintained; (iii) if following\nthe initial 12-month period beginning at the\ncommencement of trading of the\nFund, there are fewer than 50 record or\nbeneficial owners of the Shares of the Fund;\n(iv) if the value of the Fund\u0092s underlying\nindex or portfolio of securities on which the\nFund is based is no longer calculated or\navailable; or\n(v) such other event shall occur or condition\nshall exist that, in the opinion of the\nExchange, makes further dealings on the\nExchange inadvisable. If the Intraday\nIndicative Value of the Fund is not being\ndisseminated as required by Exchange\nrules, the Exchange may halt trading during\nthe day in which such interruption occurs. If\nthe interruption persists past the trading day\nin which it occurred, the Exchange will halt\ntrading in the Shares. The Exchange will\nremove the Shares from\nlisting and trading upon termination of the\nFund. The Trust reserves the right to adjust\nthe Fund Share price of the Fund in the future\nto maintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits\nor reverse stock splits, which would have no\neffect on the net assets of the Fund.\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nFund Share price of the\nFund in the future to maintain convenient\ntrading ranges for investors. Any adjustments\nwould be accomplished through stock splits or\nreverse stock splits, which would have no\neffect on the net assets of the Fund.\n\nAs in the case of other publicly traded\nsecurities, brokers\u0092 commissions on\ntransactions will be based on negotiated\ncommission rates at customary\nlevels.\n\nThe base and trading currencies of the Fund is\nthe U.S. dollar. The base currency is the\ncurrency in which the Fund\u0092s net asset value\nper\nShare is calculated and the trading currency\nis the currency in which Shares of the Fund\nare listed and traded on the Exchange.\n\n18\n\nMANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST\n\nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u0093MANAGEMENT.\u0094\n\nBoard Responsibilities. The management and\naffairs of the Trust and its series, including\nthe Fund described in this SAI, are overseen\nby the Trustees. The\nBoard has approved contracts, as described in\nthis SAI, under which certain companies\nprovide essential management services to the\nTrust.\n\nLike most\nmutual funds, the day-to-day business of the\nTrust, including the management of risk, is\nperformed by third party service providers,\nsuch as the Adviser, Distributor,\nAdministrator and Sub-Administrator. The\nTrustees are responsible for overseeing the\nTrust\u0092s service providers and, thus, have\noversight responsibility with respect to risk\nmanagement performed by those\nservice providers. Risk management seeks to\nidentify and address risks, i.e., events or\ncircumstances that could have material adverse\neffects on the business, operations,\nshareholder services, investment performance\nor reputation of the Fund. The\nFund and its service providers employ a\nvariety of processes, procedures and controls\nto identify various of those possible events\nor circumstances, to lessen the probability of\ntheir occurrence and/or to mitigate the\neffects of such events or\ncircumstances if they do occur. Each service\nprovider is responsible for one or more\ndiscrete aspects of the Trust\u0092s business\n(e.g., the Adviser is responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund\u0092s portfolio\ninvestments) and, consequently, for managing\nthe risks associated with that business. The\nBoard has emphasized to the\nFund\u0092s service providers the importance of\nmaintaining vigorous risk management.\n\nThe Trustees\u0092 role in risk oversight begins\nbefore the\ninception of the Fund, at which time the\nFund\u0092s Adviser presents the Board with\ninformation concerning the investment\nobjectives, strategies and risks of the Fund,\nas well as proposed investment limitations for\nthe Fund. Additionally, the\nFund\u0092s Adviser provides the Board with an\noverview of, among other things, their\ninvestment philosophies, brokerage practices\nand compliance infrastructures. Thereafter,\nthe Board continues its oversight function as\nvarious personnel, including\nthe Trust\u0092s Chief Compliance Officer, as well\nas personnel of the Adviser and other service\nproviders, such as the Fund\u0092s independent\naccountants, make periodic reports to the\nAudit Committee or to the Board with respect\nto various aspects\nof risk management. The Board and the Audit\nCommittee oversee efforts by management and\nservice providers to manage risks to which the\nFund may be exposed.\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the\nnature, extent and quality of the services\nprovided to the Fund by the Adviser and\nreceives information about\nthose services at its regular meetings. In\naddition, on an annual basis, in connection\nwith its consideration of whether to renew the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with the\nAdviser, the Board meets with the Adviser to\nreview such services. Among\nother things, the Board regularly considers\nthe Adviser\u0092s adherence to the Fund\u0092s\ninvestment restrictions and compliance with\nvarious Fund policies and procedures and with\napplicable securities regulations. The Board\nalso reviews\ninformation about the Fund\u0092s investments.\n\nThe Trust\u0092s Chief Compliance Officer reports\nregularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance\nissues. At least annually, the Trust\u0092s Chief\nCompliance Officer provides the Board with a\nreport reviewing the adequacy and\neffectiveness of the Trust\u0092s policies and\nprocedures and those of its service providers,\nincluding the Adviser. The\nreport addresses the operation of the policies\nand procedures of the Trust and each service\nprovider since the date of the last report;\nany material changes to the policies and\nprocedures since the date of the last report;\nany recommendations for\nmaterial changes to the policies and\nprocedures; and any material compliance\nmatters since the date of the last report.\n\nThe Board receives reports from\nthe Fund\u0092s service providers regarding\noperational risks and risks related to the\nvaluation and liquidity of portfolio\nsecurities. Regular reports are made to the\nBoard concerning investments for which market\nquotations are not readily\navailable. Annually, the independent\nregistered public accounting firm reviews with\nthe Audit Committee its audit of the Fund\u0092s\nfinancial statements, focusing on major areas\nof risk encountered by the Fund and noting any\nsignificant\ndeficiencies or material weaknesses in the\nFund\u0092s internal controls. Additionally, in\nconnection with its oversight function, the\nBoard oversees Fund management\u0092s\nimplementation of disclosure controls and\nprocedures, which are designed to\nensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports\nwith the SEC are recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the required\ntime periods. The Board also oversees the\nTrust\u0092s internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, which comprise policies\nand procedures designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the\nTrust\u0092s financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Trust\u0092s financial\nstatements.\n\nFrom their review of these reports and\ndiscussions with the Adviser, the Chief\nCompliance Officer, the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and other\nservice providers, the Board and the Audit\nCommittee learn in detail about the material\nrisks of the Fund, thereby facilitating a\ndialogue about how management and service\nproviders identify and mitigate those risks.\n\n19\n\nThe Board recognizes that not all risks that\nmay affect the Fund can be identified and/or\nquantified, that\nit may not be practical or cost-effective to\neliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it\nmay be necessary to bear certain risks (such\nas investment-related risks) to achieve the\nFund\u0092s goals, and that the processes,\nprocedures and controls\nemployed to address certain risks may be\nlimited in their effectiveness. Moreover,\nreports received by the Trustees as to risk\nmanagement matters are typically summaries of\nthe relevant information. Most of the Fund\u0092s\ninvestment management and\nbusiness affairs are carried out by or through\nthe Fund\u0092s Adviser and other service\nproviders, each of which has an independent\ninterest in risk management but whose policies\nand the methods by which one or more risk\nmanagement functions are\ncarried out may differ from the Fund\u0092s and\neach other\u0092s in the setting of priorities, the\nresources available or the effectiveness of\nrelevant controls. As a result of the\nforegoing and other factors, the Board\u0092s\nability to monitor\nand manage risk, as a practical matter, is\nsubject to limitations.\n\nTrustees and Officers. There are seven members\nof the Board of Trustees, six of\nwhom are not interested persons of the Trust,\nas that term is defined in the 1940 Act\n(\u0093Independent Trustees\u0094). Frank Nesvet, an\nIndependent Trustee, serves as Chairman of the\nBoard. The Board has determined its leadership\nstructure is\nappropriate given the specific characteristics\nand circumstances of the Trust. The Board made\nthis determination in consideration of, among\nother things, the fact that the Independent\nTrustees constitute a super-majority (greater\nthan 75%) of the\nBoard, the fact that the chairperson of each\nCommittee of the Board is an Independent\nTrustee, the amount of assets under management\nin the Trust, and the number of funds (and\nclasses of shares) overseen by the Board.

Each Code\nof Ethics permits personnel, subject to that\nCode of Ethics, to invest in securities for\ntheir personal investment accounts, subject to\ncertain limitations, including securities that\nmay be purchased or held by the Fund.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Codes of\nEthics will be effective in preventing such\nactivities. Each Code of Ethics, filed as\nexhibits to this\nregistration statement, may be examined at the\noffice of the SEC in Washington, D.C. or on\nthe Internet at the SEC\u0092s website at .\n\nPROXY VOTING POLICIES\n\nThe Board believes that the voting of\nproxies on securities held by the Fund is an\nimportant element of the overall investment\nprocess. As such, the Board has delegated the\nresponsibility to vote such proxies to the\nAdviser. Each of the Trust\u0092s and the Adviser\u0092s\nproxy voting\npolicy is attached at the end of this SAI.\nInformation regarding how the Fund voted\nproxies relating to its portfolio securities\nduring the most recent twelve-month period\nended June 30 is available: (1) without charge\nby calling 1-866-787-2257; (2) on the Fund\u0092s\nwebsite at ; and (3) on the SEC\u0092s website at\n.\n\nDISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS POLICY\n\nThe Trust has adopted a policy regarding the\ndisclosure of information about the Trust\u0092s\nportfolio holdings. The Board must approve all\nmaterial\namendments to this policy. The Fund\u0092s\nportfolio holdings are publicly disseminated\neach day the Fund is open for business through\nfinancial reporting and news services\nincluding publicly accessible Internet web\nsites. In addition, a basket\ncomposition file, which includes the security\nnames and share quantities to deliver in\nexchange for Shares, together with estimates\nand actual cash components, is publicly\ndisseminated daily prior to the opening of the\nExchange via the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation (\u0093NSCC\u0094). The\nbasket represents one Creation Unit of the\nFund. The Trust, the Adviser or State Street\nwill not disseminate non-public information\nconcerning the Trust,\nexcept information may be made available prior\nto its public availability: (i) to a party for\na legitimate business purpose related to the\nday-to-day operations of\nthe Fund, including (a) a service provider,\n(b) the stock exchanges upon which the ETF is\nlisted, (c) the NSCC, (d) the Depository Trust\nCompany, and (e) financial data/research\ncompanies such as Morningstar, Bloomberg L.P.,\nand Reuters, or (ii) to any other party for a\nlegitimate business or regulatory purpose,\nupon waiver or exception, with the consent of\nan applicable Trust officer.\n\n28\n\nINVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES\n\nTHE INVESTMENT ADVISER\n\nSSGA FM acts as investment adviser to\nthe Trust and, subject to the oversight of the\nBoard, is responsible for the investment\nmanagement of the Fund. As of June 30, 2020,\nthe Adviser managed approximately $612.89\nbillion in assets. The Adviser\u0092s principal\naddress is One\nIron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. The\nAdviser, a Massachusetts corporation, is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global\nAdvisors, Inc., which is itself a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Corporation, a\npublicly held financial\nholding company. State Street Global Advisors\n(\u0093SSGA\u0094), consisting of the Adviser and other\ninvestment advisory affiliates of State Street\nCorporation, is the investment management arm\nof State Street Corporation.\n\nThe Adviser serves as investment adviser to\nthe Fund pursuant to an investment advisory\nagreement (\u0093Investment Advisory Agreement\u0094)\nbetween the\nTrust and the Adviser. The Investment Advisory\nAgreement, with respect to the Fund, continues\nin effect for two years from its effective\ndate, and thereafter is subject to annual\napproval by (1) the Board or (2) vote of a\nmajority of the\noutstanding voting securities (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Fund, provided that in\neither event such continuance also is approved\nby a majority of the Board who are not\ninterested persons (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Trust by a vote\ncast in person at a meeting called for the\npurpose of voting on such approval. The\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with respect to\nthe Fund is terminable without penalty, on 60\ndays\u0092 notice, by the Board or by a vote of the\nholders of a majority\n(as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund\u0092s\noutstanding voting securities. The Investment\nAdvisory Agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays\u0092 notice by the Adviser and will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined\nin the 1940 Act).\n\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, the\nAdviser, subject to the oversight of the Board\nand in conformity with the stated\ninvestment policies of the Fund, manages the\ninvestment of the Fund\u0092s assets. The Adviser\nis responsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is\nnot liable for certain liabilities, including\ncertain liabilities arising under the federal\nsecurities laws, unless such loss or liability\nresults from willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence\nin the performance of its duties or the\nreckless disregard of its obligations and\nduties.\n\nFor the services provided to the Fund under\nthe Investment\nAdvisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser\nmonthly fees based on a percentage of the\nFund\u0092s average daily net assets as set forth\nin the Fund\u0092s Prospectus. From time to time,\nthe Adviser may waive all or a portion of its\nfee. The\nAdviser pays all expenses of the Fund other\nthan the management fee, brokerage, taxes,\ninterest, fees and expenses of the Independent\nTrustees (including any Trustee\u0092s counsel\nfees), acquired fund fees and expenses,\nlitigation expenses and\nother extraordinary expenses.\n\nA summary of the factors considered by the\nBoard of Trustees in connection with the\ninitial approval of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement for the Fund will be\navailable in the Fund\u0092s first shareholder\nreport after the Fund commences operations.\n\nThe Fund had not\ncommenced operations as of the date of this\nSAI and therefore did not pay fees to the\nAdviser for the past three fiscal years.\n\nFrom time to time, the\nAdviser may waive all or a portion of its fee.\nThe Adviser has contractually agreed to waive\na portion of its management fee and/or\nreimburse expenses in an amount equal to any\nacquired fund fees and expenses (excluding\nholdings in acquired funds\nfor cash management purposes, if any) for the\nFund until October 31, 2021. This contractual\nfee waiver and/or reimbursement does not\nprovide for the recoupment by the Adviser of\nany fees the Adviser previously waived. The\nAdviser may continue\nthe waiver and/or reimbursement from year to\nyear, but there is no guarantee that the\nAdviser will do so and the waiver and/or\nreimbursement may be cancelled or modified at\nany time after October 31, 2021. The waiver\nand/or reimbursement may\nnot be terminated prior to October 31, 2021\nexcept with the approval of the Board.\n\nPORTFOLIO MANAGERS\n\nThe Adviser manages the Fund using a team of\ninvestment professionals. The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management of the Fund are Todd\nBean, Sean Lussier and April Borawski. The\nfollowing table lists the number and types of\naccounts managed by each of the key\nprofessionals involved in the day-to-day\nportfolio management for the Fund and assets\nunder management in those accounts. The total\nnumber of accounts and assets have been\nallocated to each respective\nmanager. Therefore, some accounts and assets\nhave been counted twice.\n\n29\n\nOther Accounts Managed as of June 30, 2020:\n                                              \n                  \u2026                           \n      \u2026           \u2026                           \n      \u2026           \u2026      \u2026                    \n      \u2026           \u2026      \u2026                    \n      \u2026           \u2026      \u2026                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      \u2026    $      \u2026      \u2026        $      $    \n      \u2026    $      \u2026      \u2026        $      $    \n      \u2026    $      \u2026      \u2026        $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  There are no performance-based fees      \n     associated with these accounts.          \n                                              \nThe Fund had not commenced operations prior to\nthe date of this SAI and therefore the\nportfolio managers did not beneficially own\nany Shares.\n\nA portfolio manager that has responsibility\nfor managing more than one account may be\nsubject to potential conflicts of interest\nbecause he or she is\nresponsible for other accounts in addition to\nthe Fund. Those conflicts could include\npreferential treatment of one account over\nothers in terms of: (a) the portfolio\nmanager\u0092s execution of different investment\nstrategies for various\naccounts or (b) the allocation of resources or\nof investment opportunities.\n\nPortfolio managers may manage numerous\naccounts for multiple clients.\nThese accounts may include registered\ninvestment companies, other types of pooled\naccounts (e.g., collective investment funds),\nand separate accounts (i.e., accounts managed\non behalf of individuals or public or private\ninstitutions).\nPortfolio managers make investment decisions\nfor each account based on the investment\nobjectives and policies and other relevant\ninvestment considerations applicable to that\nportfolio.\n\nA potential conflict of interest may arise as\na result of the portfolio managers\u0092\nresponsibility for multiple accounts with\nsimilar investment\nguidelines. Under these circumstances, a\npotential investment may be suitable for more\nthan one of the portfolio managers\u0092 accounts,\nbut the quantity of the investment available\nfor purchase is less than the aggregate amount\nthe accounts would\nideally devote to the opportunity. Similar\nconflicts may arise when multiple accounts\nseek to dispose of the same investment. The\nportfolio managers may also manage accounts\nwhose objectives and policies differ from that\nof the Fund. These\ndifferences may be such that under certain\ncircumstances, trading activity appropriate\nfor one account managed by the portfolio\nmanager may have adverse consequences for\nanother account managed by the portfolio\nmanager. For example, an account may\nsell a significant position in a security,\nwhich could cause the market price of that\nsecurity to decrease, while the Fund\nmaintained its position in that security.\n\nA potential conflict may arise when the\nportfolio managers are responsible for\naccounts that have different advisory fees\u0097the\ndifference in fees could\ncreate an incentive for the portfolio manager\nto favor one account over another, for\nexample, in terms of access to investment\nopportunities. Another potential conflict may\narise when the portfolio manager has an\ninvestment in one or more accounts\nthat participate in transactions with other\naccounts. His or her investment(s) may create\nan incentive for the portfolio manager to\nfavor one account over another. The Adviser\nhas adopted policies and procedures reasonably\ndesigned to address these\npotential material conflicts. For instance,\nportfolio managers are normally responsible\nfor all accounts within a certain investment\ndiscipline, and do not, absent special\ncircumstances, differentiate among the various\naccounts when allocating\nresources. Additionally, the Adviser and its\nadvisory affiliates have processes and\nprocedures for allocating investment\nopportunities among portfolios that are\ndesigned to provide a fair and equitable\nallocation.\n\nSSGA\u0092s culture is complemented and reinforced\nby a total rewards strategy that is based on a\npay for performance philosophy which seeks to\noffer a\ncompetitive pay mix of base salary, benefits,\ncash incentives and deferred compensation.\n\nSalary is based on a number of factors,\nincluding external\nbenchmarking data and market trends, State\nStreet performance, SSGA performance, and\nindividual overall performance. SSGA\u0092s Global\nHuman Resources department regularly\nparticipates in compensation surveys in order\nto provide SSGA with\nmarket-based compensation information that\nhelps support individual pay decisions.\n\nAdditionally, subject to State Street and SSGA\nbusiness results, State\nStreet allocates an incentive pool to SSGA to\nreward its employees. The size of the\nincentive pool for most business units is\nbased on the firm\u0092s overall profitability and\nother factors, including performance against\nrisk-related goals. For\nmost SSGA investment teams, SSGA recognizes\nand rewards performance by linking annual\nincentive decisions for investment teams to\nthe firm\u0092s or business unit\u0092s profitability\nand business unit investment performance over\na multi-year\nperiod.\n\n30\n\nIncentive pool funding for most active\ninvestment teams is driven in part by the\npost-tax investment performance of fund(s)\nmanaged by the team versus the return levels\nof the benchmark index(es) of the fund(s) on a\none-, three- and, in some cases,\nfive-year basis. For most active investment\nteams, a material portion of incentive\ncompensation for senior staff is deferred over\na four-year period into the SSGA Long-Term\nIncentive (\u0093SSGA LTI\u0094) program. For these\nteams, The SSGA LTI\nprogram indexes the performance of these\ndeferred awards against the post-tax\ninvestment performance of fund(s) managed by\nthe team. This is intended to align our\ninvestment team\u0092s compensation with\nclient interests, both through annual\nincentive compensation awards and through the\nlong-term value of deferred awards in the SSGA\nLTI program.\n\nFor the\npassive equity investment team, incentive pool\nfunding is driven in part by the post-tax 1\nand 3-year tracking error of the funds managed\nby the team against the\nbenchmark indexes of the funds.\n\nThe discretionary allocation of the incentive\npool to the business units within SSGA is\ninfluenced by market-based\ncompensation data, as well as the overall\nperformance of each business unit. Individual\ncompensation decisions are made by the\nemployee\u0092s manager, in conjunction with the\nsenior management of the employee\u0092s business\nunit. These decisions\nare based on the overall performance of the\nemployee and, as mentioned above, on the\nperformance of the firm and business unit.\nDepending on the job level, a portion of the\nannual incentive may be awarded in deferred\ncompensation, which may include\ncash and/or Deferred Stock Awards (State\nStreet stock), which typically vest over a\nfour-year period. This helps to retain staff\nand further aligns SSGA employees\u0092 interests\nwith SSGA clients\u0092 and shareholders\u0092 long-term\ninterests.\n\nSSGA recognizes and rewards outstanding\nperformance by:\n                                              \n      Promoting employee ownership to         \n      connect employees directly to the       \n      company\u0092s success.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Using rewards to reinforce mission,     \n      vision, values and business strategy.   \n                                              \n                                              \n      Seeking to recognize and preserve the   \n      firm\u0092s unique culture and team           \n      orientation.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Providing all employees the             \n      opportunity to share in the success of  \n      SSGA.                                   \n                                              \nTHE ADMINISTRATOR, SUB-ADMINISTRATOR,\nCUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT\n\nAdministrator.

State Street serves as the sub-\nadministrator to each series of the Trust,\npursuant to a\nSub-Administration Agreement dated June 1,\n2015 (the \u0093Sub-Administration Agreement\u0094).\nUnder the Sub-Administration\nAgreement, State Street is obligated to\nprovide certain sub-administrative services to\nthe Trust and its series. State Street is a\nwholly owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation, a publicly held financial\nholding company, and is affiliated with the\nAdviser.

Its principal\naddress is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. Investor information can\nbe obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257. The\nDistributor has entered into a\ndistribution agreement (\u0093Distribution\nAgreement\u0094) with the Trust pursuant to which\nit distributes Shares of the Fund. The\nDistribution Agreement will continue for two\nyears from its effective date and is renewable\nannually thereafter.\nShares will be continuously offered for sale\nby the Trust through the Distributor only in\nCreation Units, as described in the Prospectus\nand below under \u0093Purchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units.\u0094 Shares in less than Creation\nUnits are\nnot distributed by the Distributor. The\nDistributor will deliver the Prospectus to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nand confirmations of acceptance furnished by\nit. The Distributor is a\nbroker-dealer registered under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 (the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094) and\na member of the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority (\u0093FINRA\u0094). The Distributor has no\nrole in determining the investment policies of\nthe Trust or which securities are to be\npurchased or sold by the Trust. An affiliate\nof the Distributor may assist Authorized\nParticipants (as defined below) in assembling\nshares to purchase Creation Units or upon\nredemption, for which it may\nreceive commissions or other fees from such\nAuthorized Participants. An affiliate of the\nDistributor also receives compensation from\nState Street for providing on-line creation\nand redemption functionality to\nAuthorized Participants through its Fund\nConnect application.\n\nThe Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of\nthe Adviser or Distributor, may directly or\nindirectly make cash payments to certain\nbroker-dealers for participating in activities\nthat are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives and other professionals more\nknowledgeable about exchange traded products,\nincluding the SPDR funds, or for\nother activities, such as participation in\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems.\n\nIn addition, as of the date of this SAI, the\nAdviser and/or Distributor had arrangements\nwhereby they may make payments, other than for\nthe educational\nprograms and marketing activities described\nabove, to Pershing LLC (\u0093Pershing\u0094), RBC\nCapital Markets, LLC (\u0093RBC\u0094), LPL Financial,\nLLC (\u0093LPL\u0094), and Morgan Stanley Wealth\nManagement, LLC. These amounts, which may be\nsignificant, are paid by the Adviser and/or\nDistributor from their own resources and not\nfrom Fund assets. Pursuant to these\narrangements, Pershing, RBC and LPL have\nagreed to offer certain SPDR funds to their\ncustomers and not to charge certain of\ntheir customers any commissions when those\ncustomers purchase or sell shares of certain\nSPDR funds. Payments to a broker-dealer or\nintermediary may create potential conflicts of\ninterest between the broker dealer or\nintermediary and its clients.\n\nIn addition, the Adviser or Distributor, or an\naffiliate of the Adviser or Distributor, as\nwell as an index provider that is not\naffiliated with the\nAdviser or Distributor, may also reimburse\nexpenses or make payments from their own\nassets to other persons in consideration of\nservices or other activities that they believe\nmay benefit the SPDR business or facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds.\n\nThe Distribution Agreement provides that it\nmay be terminated at any time, without the\npayment of any penalty, as to the Fund: (i) by\nvote of a majority\nof the Independent Trustees or (ii) by vote of\na majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund, on\nat least 60 days written notice to the\nDistributor. The Distribution Agreement is\nalso terminable upon\n60 days\u0092 notice by the Distributor and will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).\n\nThe continuation of\nthe Distribution Agreement and any other\nrelated agreements is subject to annual\napproval of the Board, including by a majority\nof the Independent Trustees, as described\nabove.\n\nThe allocation among the Trust\u0092s series of\nfees and expenses payable under the\nDistribution Agreement will be made pro rata\nin accordance with the daily\nnet assets of the respective series.\n\nThe Distributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers (\u0093Soliciting Dealers\u0094)\nwho will\nsolicit purchases of Creation Unit\naggregations of Shares. Such Soliciting\nDealers may also be Participating Parties (as\ndefined in the \u0093Book Entry Only System\u0094\nsection below) and/or DTC Participants (as\ndefined below).\n\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the\nTrust has agreed to indemnify the Distributor,\nand may indemnify Soliciting Dealers and\nAuthorized Participants\n(as described below) entering into agreements\nwith the Distributor, for certain liabilities,\nincluding certain liabilities arising under\nthe federal securities laws, unless such loss\nor liability results from willful misfeasance,\nbad faith or gross\nnegligence in the performance of its duties or\nthe reckless disregard of its obligations and\nduties under the Distribution Agreement or\nother agreement, as applicable.\n\nINDEX PROVIDER AND OTHER PERSONS\n\nAn unaffiliated index provider\nmay make payments from its own assets to other\npersons in consideration for services provided\nor other activities that may facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds.\n\n32\n\nBROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS\n\nAll portfolio transactions are placed on\nbehalf of the Fund by the Adviser. Purchases\nand sales of securities on a securities\nexchange are affected through\nbrokers who charge a commission for their\nservices. Ordinarily commissions are not\ncharged on over the counter orders (e.g.,\nfixed income securities) because the Fund pays\na spread which is included in the cost of the\nsecurity and represents the\ndifference between the dealer\u0092s quoted price\nat which it is willing to sell the security\nand the dealer\u0092s quoted price at which it is\nwilling to buy the security. When the Fund\nexecutes an over the counter order with an\nelectronic\ncommunications network or an alternative\ntrading system, a commission is charged\nbecause electronic communications networks and\nalternative trading systems execute such\norders on an agency basis. Securities may be\npurchased from underwriters at\nprices that include underwriting fees.\n\nIn placing a portfolio transaction, the\nAdviser seeks to achieve best execution. The\nAdviser\u0092s duty to seek\nbest execution requires the Adviser to take\nreasonable steps to obtain for the client as\nfavorable an overall result as possible for\nFund portfolio transactions under the\ncircumstances, taking into account various\nfactors that are relevant to the\nparticular transaction.\n\nThe Adviser refers to and selects from the\nlist of approved trading counterparties\nmaintained by the Adviser\u0092s Credit Risk\nManagement team. In selecting a trading\ncounterparty for a particular trade, the\nAdviser seeks to weigh relevant factors\nincluding, but not limited to the following:\n                                      \n      Prompt and reliable execution;  \n                                      \n                                              \n      The competitiveness of commission       \n      rates and spreads, if applicable;       \n                                              \n                                              \n      The financial strength, stability       \n      and/or reputation of the trading        \n      counterparty;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      The willingness and ability of the      \n      executing trading counterparty to       \n      execute transactions (and commit        \n      capital) of                             \n      size in liquid and illiquid markets     \n      without disrupting the market for the   \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      Local laws, regulations or              \n      restrictions;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      The ability of the trading              \n      counterparty to maintain                \n      confidentiality;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      The availability and capability of      \n      execution venues, including electronic  \n      communications networks for trading     \n      and                                     \n      execution management systems made       \n      available to Adviser;                   \n                                              \n                     \n      Market share;  \n                     \n                  \n      Liquidity;  \n                  \n              \n      Price;  \n              \n                                \n      Execution related costs;  \n                                \n                                       \n      History of execution of orders;  \n                                       \n                                              \n      Likelihood of execution and             \n      settlement;                             \n                                              \n                              \n      Order size and nature;  \n                              \n                                              \n      Clearing and settlement capabilities,   \n      especially in high volatility market    \n      environments;                           \n                                              \n                                            \n      Availability of lendable securities;  \n                                            \n                                              \n      Sophistication of the trading           \n      counterparty\u0092s trading capabilities and  \n      infrastructure/facilities;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      The operational efficiency with which   \n      transactions are processed and          \n      cleared, taking into account the order  \n      size                                    \n      and complexity;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Speed and responsiveness to the         \n      Adviser;                                \n                                              \n                                    \n      Access to secondary markets;  \n                                    \n                                  \n      Counterparty exposure; and  \n                                  \n                                              \n      Any other consideration the Adviser     \n      believes is relevant to the execution   \n      of the order.                           \n                                              \nIn selecting a trading counterparty, the price\nof the transaction and costs related to the\nexecution of the transaction typically merit a\nhigh relative\nimportance, depending on the circumstances.\nThe Adviser does not necessarily select a\ntrading counterparty based upon price and\ncosts but may take other relevant factors into\naccount if it believes that these are\nimportant in taking reasonable steps\nto obtain the best possible result for the\nFund under the circumstances. Consequently,\nthe Adviser may cause a client to pay a\ntrading counterparty more than another trading\ncounterparty might have charged for the same\ntransaction in recognition of\nthe value and quality of the brokerage\nservices provided. The following matters may\ninfluence the relative importance that the\nAdviser places upon the relevant factors:\n\n33\n\n(i) The nature and characteristics of the\norder or transaction. For example, size of\norder,\nmarket impact of order, limits, or other\ninstructions relating to the order;\n\n(ii) The characteristics of the financial\ninstrument(s) or\nother assets which are the subject of that\norder. For example, whether the order pertains\nto an equity, fixed income, derivative or\nconvertible instrument;\n\n(iii) The characteristics of the execution\nvenues to which that order can be directed, if\nrelevant. For example, availability and\ncapabilities\nof electronic trading systems;\n\n(iv) Whether the transaction is a \u0091delivery\nversus payment\u0092 or \u0091over the counter\u0092\ntransaction. The creditworthiness of the\ntrading counterparty, the amount of existing\nexposure to a trading counterparty and trading\ncounterparty settlement capabilities may be\ngiven a higher relative importance in the case\nof \u0091over the\ncounter\u0092 transactions; and\n\n(v) Any other circumstances relevant the\nAdviser believes is relevant at the time.\n\nThe process by which trading counterparties\nare selected to effect transactions is\ndesigned to exclude consideration of the sales\nefforts conducted by\nbroker-dealers in relation to the Fund.\n\nThe Adviser does not currently use the Fund\u0092s\nassets in connection with third party soft\ndollar\narrangements. While the Adviser does not\ncurrently use \u0093soft\u0094 or commission dollars\npaid by the Fund for the purchase of third\nparty research, the Adviser reserves the right\nto do so in the future.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not pay\nbrokerage commissions during the past three\nfiscal years.\n\nSecurities of \u0093Regular Broker-Dealers.\u0094 The\nFund is required to identify any securities of\nits \u0093regular brokers and dealers\u0094 (as such\nterm\nis defined in the 1940 Act) which it may hold\nat the close of its most recent fiscal year.\n\u0093Regular brokers or dealers\u0094 of the Trust are\nthe ten brokers or dealers that, during the\nmost recent fiscal year: (i) received the\ngreatest\ndollar amounts of brokerage commissions from\nthe Trust\u0092s portfolio transactions; (ii)\nengaged as principal in the largest dollar\namounts of portfolio transactions of the\nTrust; or (iii) sold the largest dollar\namounts of the\nTrust\u0092s shares.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any holdings in Securities of Regular\nBroker-Dealers as of June 30, 2020.\n\nPortfolio Turnover. Portfolio turnover may\nvary from year to year, as well as within a\nyear. High turnover\nrates are likely to result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses or transaction\ncosts. The overall reasonableness of brokerage\ncommissions and transaction costs is evaluated\nby the Adviser based upon its knowledge of\navailable information as\nto the general level of commissions and\ntransaction costs paid by other institutional\ninvestors for comparable services.\n\nBOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM\n\nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled\n\u0093ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION.\u0094\n\nThe Depository Trust Company (\u0093DTC\u0094) acts as\nsecurities depositary for the Shares. Shares\nof the Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee,\nCede & Co., and deposited with, or on behalf\nof, DTC. Except in the limited circumstance\nprovided below, certificates will not be\nissued for Shares.\n\nDTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was\ncreated to hold securities of its participants\n(the \u0093DTC Participants\u0094) and to facilitate the\nclearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions among the DTC Participants in\nsuch securities through electronic book-entry\nchanges in accounts of the DTC Participants,\nthereby eliminating the need for physical\nmovement of securities\ncertificates. DTC Participants include\nsecurities brokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations and certain\nother organizations, some of whom (and/or\ntheir representatives) own DTC. More\nspecifically, DTC is owned by a number of\nits DTC Participants and by the New York Stock\nExchange (\u0093NYSE\u0094) and FINRA. Access to the DTC\nsystem is also available to others such as\nbanks, brokers, dealers and trust companies\nthat clear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship\nwith a DTC Participant, either directly or\nindirectly (the \u0093Indirect Participants\u0094).\n\n34\n\nBeneficial ownership of Shares is limited to\nDTC Participants, Indirect Participants and\npersons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in Shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as\n\u0093Beneficial Owners\u0094) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is\neffected only through, records maintained by\nDTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on\nthe records of DTC Participants (with respect\nto Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive\nfrom or through the DTC Participant a written\nconfirmation relating to their purchase of\nShares.\n\nConveyance of all notices, statements and\nother\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the Shares\nof the Fund held by each DTC Participant. The\nTrust, either directly or through a third\nparty service, shall inquire of each such DTC\nParticipant as to the number of Beneficial\nOwners holding Shares, directly or indirectly,\nthrough such DTC\nParticipant. The Trust, either directly or\nthrough a third party service, shall provide\neach such DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may\nreasonably request, in order that such notice,\nstatement or communication may be transmitted\nby such DTC Participant, directly or\nindirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In\naddition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC\nParticipant and/or third party\nservice a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to\nsuch transmittal, all subject to applicable\nstatutory and regulatory requirements.\n\nShare distributions shall be made to DTC or\nits nominee, Cede & Co., as the registered\nholder of all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon\nreceipt of any\nsuch distributions, shall credit immediately\nDTC Participants\u0092 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in Shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC\nParticipants to Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners of Shares held through such\nDTC Participants will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is\nnow the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in\nbearer form or registered in a \u0093street name,\u0094\nand will be the responsibility of such DTC\nParticipants.\n\nThe Trust has no responsibility or\nliability for any aspects of the records\nrelating to or notices to Beneficial Owners,\nor payments made on account of beneficial\nownership interests in such Shares, or for\nmaintaining, supervising or reviewing any\nrecords relating to such beneficial\nownership interests or for any other aspect of\nthe relationship between DTC and the DTC\nParticipants or the relationship between such\nDTC Participants and the Indirect Participants\nand Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC\nParticipants.\n\nDTC may determine to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to Shares at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its\nresponsibilities with respect thereto under\napplicable law. Under such circumstances, the\nTrust shall take action either to find a\nreplacement for DTC to perform its functions\nat a comparable cost or, if such a replacement\nis unavailable, to issue\nand deliver printed certificates representing\nownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes\nother arrangements with respect thereto\nsatisfactory to the Exchange.\n\nCONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF\nSECURITIES\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations prior to\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any beneficial owners that owned greater\nthan 5% of the\noutstanding voting securities as of the date\nof this SAI.\n\nAn Authorized Participant (as defined below)\nmay hold of record more than 25% of the\noutstanding Shares. From time to time,\nAuthorized Participants may be a beneficial\nand/or legal owner of the Fund, may be\naffiliated with an index provider, may be\ndeemed to have control of the Fund and/or may\nbe able to affect the outcome of\nmatters presented for a vote of the\nshareholders of the Fund. Authorized\nParticipants may execute an irrevocable proxy\ngranting the Distributor or another affiliate\nof State Street (the \u0093Agent\u0094) power to vote or\nabstain from voting such\nAuthorized Participant\u0092s beneficially or\nlegally owned Shares. In such cases, the Agent\nshall mirror vote (or abstain from voting)\nsuch Shares in the same proportion as all\nother beneficial owners of the Fund.\n\nThe Trustees and Officers of the Trust, as a\ngroup, own less than 1% of the Trust\u0092s voting\nsecurities as of the date of this SAI.\n\nPURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\n\nThe Fund issues and redeems its Shares on a\ncontinuous basis, at net asset value, only in\na large specified number of Shares called a\n\u0093Creation\nUnit,\u0094 either principally in-kind for\nsecurities included in the Index or in cash\nfor the value of such securities. The value of\nthe Fund is determined once each business day,\nas described under\n\u0093Determination of Net Asset Value.\u0094 A Creation\nUnit of the Fund consists of 50,000 Shares,\nbut may change. Authorized Participants (as\ndefined below) will be notified of such\nchange. The principal consideration for\ncreations and\nredemptions for the Fund is in-kind, although\nthis may be revised at any time without\nnotice.\n\nPURCHASE\n(CREATION). The Trust issues and sells Shares\nof the Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Principal\nUnderwriter, without a sales load (but subject\nto transaction fees), at their NAV per share\nnext determined after receipt of\nan order, on any Business Day (as defined\nbelow), in proper form pursuant to the terms\nof the Authorized Participant Agreement\n(\u0093Participant Agreement\u0094). A \u0093Business Day\u0094\nwith respect to the Fund is, generally, any\nday on which\nthe NYSE is open for business, plus Veterans\nDay and Columbus Day.\n\n35\n\nFUND DEPOSIT. The consideration for purchase\nof a Creation Unit of the Fund generally\nconsists of either\n(i) the in- kind deposit of a designated\nportfolio of securities (the \u0093Deposit\nSecurities\u0094) per each Creation Unit\nconstituting a substantial replication, or a\nportfolio sampling representation, of the\nsecurities included in the\nFund\u0092s benchmark Index and the Cash Component\n(defined below), computed as described below\nor (ii) the cash value of the Deposit\nSecurities (\u0093Deposit Cash\u0094) and \u0093Cash\nComponent,\u0094 computed as described below. When\naccepting purchases of Creation Units for\ncash, the Fund may incur additional costs\nassociated with the acquisition of Deposit\nSecurities that would otherwise be provided by\nan in-kind purchaser.\n\nTogether, the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u0093Fund Deposit,\u0094 which\nrepresents the minimum\ninitial and subsequent investment amount for a\nCreation Unit of the Fund. The \u0093Cash\nComponent\u0094 which may include a Dividend\nEquivalent Payment, is an amount equal to the\ndifference between the net asset value of the\nShares (per Creation\nUnit) and the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. The\n\u0093Dividend Equivalent Payment\u0094 enables the Fund\nto make a complete distribution of dividends\non the day preceding the next dividend payment\ndate, and\nis an amount equal, on a per Creation Unit\nbasis, to the dividends on all the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund (\u0093Dividend Securities\u0094)\nwith ex-dividend dates within the accumulation\nperiod for such\ndistribution (the \u0093Accumulation Period\u0094), net\nof expenses and liabilities for such period,\nas if all of the Dividend Securities had been\nheld by the Fund for the entire Accumulation\nPeriod. The Accumulation Period begins on the\nex-dividend date for the Fund and ends on the\nday preceding the next ex-dividend date. If\nthe Cash Component is a positive number (i.e.,\nthe net asset value per\nCreation Unit exceeds the market value of the\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable), the Cash Component shall be such\npositive amount. If the Cash Component is a\nnegative number (i.e., the net asset value per\nCreation Unit is\nless than the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),\nthe Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to\nreceive cash in an amount equal to the Cash\nComponent. The Cash Component\nserves the function of compensating for any\ndifferences between the net asset value per\nCreation Unit and the market value of the\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable. Computation of the Cash Component\nexcludes any stamp duty or other\nsimilar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities, if applicable, which shall\nbe the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below).\n\nThe Custodian, through NSCC, makes available\non each Business Day, prior to the opening of\nbusiness on the NYSE (currently 9:30 a.m.,\nEastern time), the list\nof the names and the required number of shares\nof each Deposit Security or the required\namount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, to be\nincluded in the current Fund Deposit (based on\ninformation at the end of the previous\nBusiness Day) for the Fund.\nSuch Fund Deposit is subject to any applicable\nadjustments as described below, in order to\neffect purchases of Creation Units of the Fund\nuntil such time as the next-announced\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities or the\nrequired amount of Deposit\nCash, as applicable, is made available.\n\nThe identity and number of shares of the\nDeposit Securities or the amount of Deposit\nCash, as applicable,\nrequired for a Fund Deposit for the Fund\nchanges as rebalancing adjustments, interest\npayments and corporate action events are\nreflected from time to time by the Adviser\nwith a view to the investment objective of the\nFund. Information regarding a\nFund Deposit necessary for the purchase of a\nCreation Unit is made available to Authorized\nParticipants and other market participants\nseeking to transact in Creation Unit\naggregations. The composition of the Deposit\nSecurities may also change in\nresponse to adjustments to the weighting or\ncomposition of the component securities of the\nFund\u0092s Index.\n\nAs noted above, the Trust reserves the\nright to permit or require the substitution of\nDeposit Cash to replace any Deposit Security,\nwhich shall be added to the Cash Component,\nincluding, without limitation, in situations\nwhere the Deposit Security: (i) may not be\navailable in\nsufficient quantity for delivery, (ii) may not\nbe eligible for transfer through the systems\nof DTC for corporate securities and municipal\nsecurities or the Federal Reserve System for\nU.S. Treasury securities; (iii) may not be\neligible for\ntrading by an Authorized Participant (as\ndefined below) or the investor for which it is\nacting; (iv) would be restricted under the\nsecurities laws or where the delivery of the\nDeposit Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in the\ndisposition of the Deposit Security by the\nAuthorized Participant becoming restricted\nunder the securities laws, or (v) in certain\nother situations (collectively, \u0093non-standard\norders\u0094). The\nTrust also reserves the right to: (i) permit\nor require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of Deposit Cash; and (ii)\ninclude or remove Deposit Securities from the\nbasket in anticipation of Index rebalancing\nchanges. The\nadjustments described above will reflect\nchanges, known to the Adviser on the date of\nannouncement to be in effect by the time of\ndelivery of the Fund Deposit, in the\ncomposition of the subject Index being tracked\nby the Fund or resulting from\ncertain corporate actions.\n\nPROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the Principal\nUnderwriter, as facilitated via\nthe Transfer Agent, to purchase a Creation\nUnit of the Fund, an entity must be (i) a\n\u0093Participating Party\u0094, i.e., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the\nNSCC (the \u0093Clearing Process\u0094), a clearing\nagency that is registered with the SEC; or\n(ii) a DTC Participant (see \u0093BOOK ENTRY ONLY\nSYSTEM\u0094) and have the ability to clear through\nthe Federal Reserve System. In addition, each\nParticipating Party or DTC Participant (each,\nan \u0093Authorized Participant\u0094) must execute a\nParticipant Agreement that has been agreed to\nby the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer\n\n36\n\nAgent, and that has been accepted by the\nTrust, with respect to purchases and\nredemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized\nParticipant will agree, pursuant to the terms\nof a Participant\nAgreement, on behalf of itself or any investor\non whose behalf it will act, to certain\nconditions, including that it will pay to the\nTrust, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the\nCash Component together with the creation\ntransaction fee (described\nbelow) and any other applicable fees, taxes\nand additional variable charge.\n\nAll orders to purchase Shares directly from\nthe Fund, including non-standard orders, must\nbe placed for one or more Creation Units and\nin the manner and by the time set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement and/or the applicable\norder form. The date on which an order to\npurchase\nCreation Units (or an order to redeem Creation\nUnits, as set forth below) is received and\naccepted is referred to as the \u0093Order\nPlacement Date.\u0094\n\nAn Authorized Participant may require an\ninvestor to make certain representations or\nenter into agreements with respect to the\norder (e.g., to provide\nfor payments of cash, when required).\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and that, therefore,\norders to purchase Shares directly from the\nFund in Creation Units have to be placed by\nthe investor\u0092s broker through an Authorized\nParticipant that has executed a Participant\nAgreement. In such cases there may be\nadditional charges to such investor. At any\ngiven time, there may be only a limited number\nof broker-dealers that have\nexecuted a Participant Agreement and only a\nsmall number of such Authorized Participants\nmay have international capabilities.\n\nOn days when the Exchange\nor the bond markets close earlier than normal,\nthe Fund may require orders to create Creation\nUnits to be placed earlier in the day. In\naddition, if a market or markets on which the\nFund\u0092s investments are primarily traded is\nclosed, the Fund\nwill also generally not accept orders on such\nday(s). Orders must be transmitted by an\nAuthorized Participant by telephone or other\ntransmission method acceptable to the\nDistributor pursuant to procedures set forth\nin the Participant Agreement and\nin accordance with the applicable order form.\nThose placing orders through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nby the cut-off time. Economic\nor market disruptions or changes, or telephone\nor other communication failure may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or an\nAuthorized Participant.\n\nFund Deposits must be delivered by an\nAuthorized Participant through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government\nsecurities), or through DTC (for\ncorporate securities and municipal\nsecurities), through a subcustody agent (for\nforeign securities) and/or through such other\narrangements allowed by the Trust or its\nagents. With respect to foreign Deposit\nSecurities, the Custodian shall cause the\nsubcustodian of the Fund to maintain an\naccount into which the Authorized Participant\nshall deliver, on behalf of itself or the\nparty on whose behalf it is acting, such\nDeposit Securities. Foreign Deposit Securities\nmust be delivered to an account\nmaintained at the applicable local\nsubcustodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must\nbe ordered by the Authorized Participant in a\ntimely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of\nthe requisite number of Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable,\nto the account of the Fund or its agents by no\nlater than the Settlement Date. The\n\u0093Settlement Date\u0094 for the Fund is generally\nthe second Business Day (\u0093T+2\u0094) after the\nOrder Placement Date. All questions as to the\nnumber of\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be\ndelivered, as applicable, and the validity,\nform and eligibility (including time of\nreceipt) for the deposit of any tendered\nsecurities or cash, as applicable, will be\ndetermined by the Trust, whose\ndetermination shall be final and binding. The\namount of cash represented by the Cash\nComponent must be transferred directly to the\nCustodian through the Federal Reserve Bank\nwire transfer system in a timely manner so as\nto be received by the\nCustodian no later than the Settlement Date.\nIf the Cash Component and the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, are\nnot received in a timely manner by the\nSettlement Date, the creation order may be\ncancelled. Upon written notice to the\nDistributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using a\nFund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect\nthe then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery\nof Creation Units so created generally will\noccur no later than the\nsecond Business Day following the day on which\nthe purchase order is deemed received by the\nDistributor.\n\nThe order shall be deemed to be received on\nthe\nBusiness Day on which the order is placed\nprovided that the order is placed in proper\nform prior to the applicable cut-off time and\nthe federal funds in the appropriate amount\nare deposited by 2:00 p.m. or\n3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions), with the Custodian on the\nSettlement Date. If the order is not placed in\nproper form as required, or federal funds in\nthe appropriate amount are not received by\n2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern\ntime (per applicable instructions) on the\nSettlement Date, then the order may be deemed\nto be rejected and the Authorized Participant\nshall be liable to the Fund for losses, if\nany, resulting therefrom. A creation request\nis considered to be in\n\u0093proper form\u0094 if all procedures set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, order form and this\nSAI are properly followed.\n\nISSUANCE OF A CREATION\nUNIT. Except as provided herein, Creation\nUnits will not be issued until the transfer of\ngood title to the Trust of the Deposit\nSecurities or payment of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the\nsubcustodian has confirmed to the Custodian\nthat the required Deposit Securities (or the\ncash value thereof) have been delivered to the\naccount of the relevant subcustodian or\nsubcustodians, the Principal Underwriter and\nthe Adviser shall be\nnotified of such delivery, and the Trust will\nissue and cause the delivery of the Creation\nUnits.\n\nIn instances where the Trust accepts Deposit\nSecurities\nfor the purchase of a Creation Unit, the\nCreation Unit may be purchased in advance of\nreceipt by the Trust of all or a portion of\nthe applicable Deposit Securities as described\nbelow. In these circumstances, the initial\ndeposit will have a value\ngreater than the net asset value of the Shares\non the date the order is placed in proper form\nsince in\n\n37\n\naddition to available Deposit Securities, cash\nmust be deposited in an amount equal to the\nsum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii) an\nadditional amount of cash equal to a\npercentage of\nthe market value as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement, of the undelivered\nDeposit Securities (the \u0093Additional Cash\nDeposit\u0094), which shall be maintained in a\ngeneral non-interest bearing\ncollateral account. An additional amount of\ncash shall be required to be deposited with\nthe Trust, pending delivery of the missing\nDeposit Securities to the extent necessary to\nmaintain the Additional Cash Deposit with the\nTrust in an amount at\nleast equal to the applicable percentage, as\nset forth in the Participant Agreement, of the\ndaily marked to market value of the missing\nDeposit Securities. The Trust may use such\nAdditional Cash Deposit to buy the missing\nDeposit Securities at any\ntime. Authorized Participants will be liable\nto the Trust for all costs, expenses,\ndividends, income and taxes associated with\nmissing Deposit Securities, including the\ncosts incurred by the Trust in connection with\nany such purchases. These costs\nwill be deemed to include the amount by which\nthe actual purchase price of the Deposit\nSecurities exceeds the market value of such\nDeposit Securities on the day the purchase\norder was deemed received by the Principal\nUnderwriter plus the brokerage\nand related transaction costs associated with\nsuch purchases. The Trust will return any\nunused portion of the Additional Cash Deposit\nonce all of the missing Deposit Securities\nhave been properly received by the Custodian\nor purchased by the Trust\nand deposited into the Trust. In addition, a\ntransaction fee as set forth below under\n\u0093Creation Transaction Fees\u0094 will be charged in\nall cases and an additional variable charge\nmay also be applied. The delivery of Creation\nUnits so created\ngenerally will occur no later than the\nSettlement Date.\n\nACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF CREATION UNITS. The\nTrust reserves the absolute right to reject an\norder\nfor Creation Units transmitted in respect of\nthe Fund at its discretion, including, without\nlimitation, if (a) the order is not in proper\nform; (b) the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, delivered by the\nAuthorized\nParticipant are not as disseminated through\nthe facilities of the NSCC for that date by\nthe Custodian; (c) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the Shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding Shares of\nthe Fund;\n(d) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would\nhave certain adverse tax consequences to the\nFund; (e) the acceptance of the Fund Deposit\nwould, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful;\n(f) the acceptance of the Fund Deposit would\notherwise, in the discretion of the Trust or\nthe Adviser, have an adverse effect on the\nTrust or the rights of beneficial owners; (g)\nthe acceptance or receipt of the order for a\nCreation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel\nto the Trust, be\nunlawful; or (h) in the event that\ncircumstances outside the control of the\nTrust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent\nand/or the Adviser make it for all practical\npurposes not feasible to process orders for\nCreation Units. Examples of such\ncircumstances include acts of God or public\nservice or utility problems such as fires,\nfloods, extreme weather conditions and power\noutages resulting in telephone, telecopy and\ncomputer failures; market conditions or\nactivities causing trading\nhalts; systems failures involving computer or\nother information systems affecting the Trust,\nthe Principal Underwriter, the Custodian, the\nTransfer Agent, DTC, NSCC, Federal Reserve\nSystem, or any other participant in the\ncreation process, and other\nextraordinary events. The Trust or its agents\nshall communicate to the Authorized\nParticipant its rejection of an order. The\nTrust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and\nthe Principal Underwriter are under no duty,\nhowever, to give notification of\nany defects or irregularities in the delivery\nof Fund Deposits nor shall either of them\nincur any liability for the failure to give\nany such notification. The Trust, the Transfer\nAgent, the Custodian and the Principal\nUnderwriter shall not be liable\nfor the rejection of any purchase order for\nCreation Units.\n\nAll questions as to the number of shares of\neach security in the Deposit Securities and\nthe\nvalidity, form, eligibility and acceptance for\ndeposit of any securities to be delivered\nshall be determined by the Trust, and the\nTrust\u0092s determination shall be final and\nbinding. REDEMPTION. Shares may be redeemed\nonly in Creation Units at\ntheir net asset value next determined after\nreceipt of a redemption request in proper form\nby the Fund through the Transfer Agent and\nonly on a Business Day. EXCEPT UPON\nLIQUIDATION OF THE FUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT\nREDEEM SHARES IN AMOUNTS LESS THAN\nCREATION UNITS. Investors must accumulate\nenough Shares in the secondary market to\nconstitute a Creation Unit in order to have\nsuch Shares redeemed by the Trust. There can\nbe no assurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the\npublic trading market at any time to permit\nassembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should\nexpect to incur brokerage and other costs in\nconnection with assembling a sufficient number\nof Shares to constitute a redeemable Creation\nUnit.\n\nWith respect to the Fund, the Custodian,\nthrough the NSCC, makes available prior to the\nopening of business on the NYSE (currently\n9:30 a.m. Eastern time) on\neach Business Day, the list of the names and\nshare quantities of the Fund\u0092s portfolio\nsecurities that will be applicable (subject to\npossible amendment or correction) to\nredemption requests received in proper form\n(as defined below) on that day\n(\u0093Fund Securities\u0094). Fund Securities received\non redemption may not be identical to Deposit\nSecurities.\n\nRedemption proceeds for a Creation Unit\nare paid either in-kind or in cash, or a\ncombination thereof, as determined by the\nTrust. With respect to in-kind redemptions of\nthe Fund, redemption proceeds for a\nCreation Unit will consist of Fund Securities\nas announced by the Custodian prior to the\nopening of business on the Business Day of the\nrequest for redemption received in proper form\nplus cash in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the net\nasset value of the Shares being redeemed, as\nnext determined after a receipt of a request\nin proper form, and the value of the Fund\nSecurities (the \u0093Cash Redemption Amount\u0094),\nless a fixed redemption transaction fee and\nany applicable\nadditional variable charge as set forth below.\nIn the event that the Fund Securities have a\nvalue greater than the net asset value of the\nShares, a compensating cash payment equal to\nthe differential is required to be made by or\nthrough an\nAuthorized Participant by the redeeming\nshareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at\nthe Trust\u0092s discretion, an Authorized\nParticipant may receive the corresponding cash\nvalue of the securities in lieu of the\nin-kind securities value representing one or\nmore Fund Securities.\n\n38\n\nPROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS.\nAfter the Trust has deemed an order for\nredemption received,\nthe Trust will initiate procedures to transfer\nthe requisite Fund Securities and the Cash\nRedemption Amount to the Authorized\nParticipant by the Settlement Date. With\nrespect to in-kind redemptions of the\nFund, the calculation of the value of the Fund\nSecurities and the Cash Redemption Amount to\nbe delivered upon redemption will be made by\nthe Custodian according to the procedures set\nforth under \u0093Determination of Net Asset\nValue\u0094, computed\non the Business Day on which a redemption\norder is deemed received by the Trust.\nTherefore, if a redemption order in proper\nform is submitted to the Principal Underwriter\nby a DTC Participant by the specified time on\nthe Order Placement Date, and\nthe requisite number of Shares of the Fund are\ndelivered to the Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m.\nor 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, then the\nvalue of the Fund Securities and the Cash\nRedemption Amount to be\ndelivered will be determined by the Custodian\non such Order Placement Date. If the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund are not delivered\nby 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per\napplicable instructions) on the Settlement\nDate, the Fund will\nnot release the underlying securities for\ndelivery unless collateral is posted in such\npercentage amount of missing Shares as set\nforth in the Participant Agreement (marked to\nmarket daily).\n\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of the\nFund, in connection with taking delivery of\nshares of Fund Securities upon\nredemption of Creation Units, an Authorized\nParticipant must maintain appropriate custody\narrangements with a qualified broker-dealer,\nbank or other custody providers in each\njurisdiction in which any of the Fund\nSecurities are customarily traded\n(or such other arrangements as allowed by the\nTrust or its agents), to which account such\nFund Securities will be delivered. Deliveries\nof redemption proceeds generally will be made\nwithin two Business Days of the trade date.\nDue to the schedule of\nholidays in certain countries, however, the\ndelivery of in-kind redemption proceeds may\ntake longer than two Business Days after the\nday on which the redemption request is\nreceived in proper form. The section\nbelow entitled \u0093Local Market Holiday\nSchedules\u0094 identifies the instances where more\nthan seven days would be needed to deliver\nredemption proceeds. Pursuant to an order of\nthe SEC, in respect of the Fund, the Trust\nwill make delivery of in-kind redemption\nproceeds within the number of days stated in\nthe Local Market Holidays section to be the\nmaximum number of days necessary to deliver\nredemption proceeds. If the Authorized\nParticipant has not made\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nthe Fund Securities in the applicable foreign\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of the Fund\nSecurities in such\njurisdiction, the Trust may, in its\ndiscretion, exercise its option to redeem such\nShares in cash, and the Authorized Participant\nwill be required to receive its redemption\nproceeds in cash.\n\nIf it is not possible to make other such\narrangements, or if it is not possible to\neffect deliveries of the Fund Securities, the\nTrust may in its discretion\nexercise its option to redeem such Shares in\ncash, and the redeeming investor will be\nrequired to receive its redemption proceeds in\ncash. In addition, an investor may request a\nredemption in cash that the Fund may, in its\nsole discretion, permit.\nIn either case, the investor will receive a\ncash payment equal to the NAV of its Shares\nbased on the NAV of Shares of the Fund next\ndetermined after the redemption request is\nreceived in proper form (minus a redemption\ntransaction fee and additional\ncharge for requested cash redemptions\nspecified above, to offset the Trust\u0092s\nbrokerage and other transaction costs\nassociated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). The Fund may also, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder,\nprovide such redeemer a portfolio of\nsecurities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Fund Securities but does\nnot differ in net asset value.\n\nAn\nAuthorized Participant submitting a redemption\nrequest is deemed to represent to the Trust\nthat, as of the close of the Business Day on\nwhich the redemption request was submitted, it\n(or its client) will own (within the meaning\nof Rule 200 of\nRegulation SHO) or has arranged to borrow for\ndelivery to the Trust on or prior to the\nSettlement Date of the redemption request, the\nrequisite number of Shares of the Fund to be\nredeemed as a Creation Unit. In either case,\nthe Authorized\nParticipant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i)\nit (or its client) has full legal authority\nand legal right to tender for redemption the\nrequisite number of Shares of the Fund and to\nreceive the entire proceeds of the redemption;\nand\n(ii) if such Shares submitted for redemption\nhave been loaned or pledged to another party\nor are the subject of a repurchase agreement,\nsecurities lending agreement or any other\narrangement affecting legal or beneficial\nownership of such Shares\nbeing tendered, there are no restrictions\nprecluding the tender and delivery of such\nShares (including borrowed shares, if any) for\nredemption, free and clear of liens, on the\nredemption Settlement Date. The Trust reserves\nthe right to verify these\nrepresentations at its discretion, but will\ntypically require verification with respect to\na redemption request from the Fund in\nconnection with higher levels of redemption\nactivity and/or short interest in the Fund. If\nthe Authorized Participant,\nupon receipt of a verification request, does\nnot provide sufficient verification of its\nrepresentations as determined by the Trust,\nthe redemption request will not be considered\nto have been received in proper form and may\nbe rejected by the Trust.\n\nRedemptions of Shares for Fund Securities will\nbe subject to compliance with applicable\nfederal and state securities laws and the Fund\n(whether or not it\notherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves\nthe right to redeem Creation Units for cash to\nthe extent that the Trust could not lawfully\ndeliver specific Fund Securities upon\nredemptions or could not do so without first\nregistering the Fund\nSecurities under such laws. An Authorized\nParticipant or an investor for which it is\nacting subject to a legal restriction with\nrespect to a particular security included in\nthe Fund Securities applicable to the\nredemption of Creation Units may be\npaid an equivalent amount of cash. The\nAuthorized Participant may request the\nredeeming investor of the Shares to complete\nan order form or to enter into agreements with\nrespect to such matters as compensating cash\npayment. Further, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u0093qualified\ninstitutional buyer,\u0094 (\u0093QIB\u0094) as such term is\ndefined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act,\nwill not be able to receive Fund Securities\nthat are restricted securities eligible for\nresale\nunder Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may\nbe required by the Trust to provide a written\nconfirmation with respect to QIB status in\norder to receive Fund Securities.\n\n39\n\nThe right of redemption may be suspended or\nthe date of payment postponed with respect to\nthe Fund\n(1) for any period during which the Exchange\nis closed (other than customary weekend and\nholiday closings); (2) for any period during\nwhich trading on the Exchange is suspended or\nrestricted; (3) for any period during which an\nemergency exists as a result of which disposal\nof the Shares of the Fund or determination of\nthe NAV of the Shares is not reasonably\npracticable; or (4) in such other circumstance\nas is permitted by the SEC.\n\nREQUIRED EARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as described in\nthe Participant Agreement and/or applicable\norder form, the Fund may\nrequire orders to be placed prior to the trade\ndate, as described in the Participant\nAgreement or the applicable order form, in\norder to receive the trade date\u0092s net asset\nvalue. The cut-off time to\nreceive the trade date\u0092s net asset value will\nnot precede the calculation of the net asset\nvalue of the Fund\u0092s shares on the prior\nBusiness Day. Orders to purchase shares of\nsuch funds that are submitted on the Business\nDay immediately\npreceding a holiday or a day (other than a\nweekend) that the equity markets in the\nrelevant foreign market are closed may not be\naccepted. Authorized Participants may be\nnotified that the cut-off time for an\norder may be earlier on a particular Business\nDay, as described in the Participant Agreement\nand the applicable order form.\n\nCREATION AND REDEMPTION\nTRANSACTION FEES. A transaction fee, as set\nforth in the table below, is imposed for the\ntransfer and other transaction costs\nassociated with the purchase or redemption of\nCreation Units, as applicable. Authorized\nParticipants will be required to\npay a fixed creation transaction fee and/or a\nfixed redemption transaction fee, as\napplicable, on a given day regardless of the\nnumber of Creation Units created or redeemed\non that day. The Fund may adjust the\ntransaction fee from time to time. An\nadditional charge or a variable charge\n(discussed below) will be applied to certain\ncreation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standard orders and whole or\npartial cash purchases or redemptions. With\nrespect to creation orders, Authorized\nParticipants are responsible for the costs of\ntransferring the securities constituting the\nDeposit Securities to the account of the Trust\nand with respect to redemption orders,\nAuthorized Participants are\nresponsible for the costs of transferring the\nFund Securities from the Trust to their\naccount or on their order. Investors who use\nthe services of a broker or other such\nintermediary may also be charged a fee for\nsuch services.\n\nCreation and Redemption Transaction Fees:\n                                              \n                                     MAXIMUM  \n                  TRANSACT\u2026       TRANSACTI\u2026  \n  FUND             FEE*,\u00a0**         FEE*,\u00a0**  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  3-12         $        250    $       1,000  \n  Month                                       \n  T-Bill                                      \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n     From time to time, the Fund may waive    \n     all or a portion of its applicable       \n     transaction fee(s).

Expenses and fees,\nincluding the management fees, are accrued\ndaily and taken into account for purposes of\ndetermining net asset\nvalue. The net asset value of the Fund is\ncalculated by State Street and determined once\ndaily as of the close of the regular trading\nsession on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange\nis open. Fixed-income assets\nare generally valued as of the announced\nclosing time for trading in fixed-income\ninstruments in a particular market or\nexchange. Creation/redemption order cut-off\ntimes may be earlier on any day that the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable exchange or market\non which the Fund\u0092s investments are traded)\nannounces an early closing time. Any assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar\nare converted into U.S. dollars at market\nrates on the date of valuation (generally as\nof 4:00 p.m. London time) as quoted by one or\nmore sources.\n\nIn\ncalculating the Fund\u0092s net asset value per\nShare, the Fund\u0092s investments are generally\nvalued using market valuations. A market\nvaluation generally means a valuation (i)\nobtained from an exchange, a pricing service,\nor a major market\nmaker (or dealer), (ii) based on a price\nquotation or other equivalent indication of\nvalue supplied by an exchange, a pricing\nservice, or a major market maker (or dealer)\nor (iii) based on amortized cost. The Fund\nrelies on a third-party\nservice provider for assistance with the daily\ncalculation of the Fund\u0092s NAV. The third-party\nservice provider, in turn, relies on other\nparties for certain pricing data and other\ninputs used in the\n\n40\n\ncalculation of the Fund\u0092s NAV. Therefore, the\nFund is subject to certain operational risks\nassociated with reliance on its service\nprovider and that service provider\u0092s sources\nof\npricing and other data. NAV calculation may be\nadversely affected by operational risks\narising from factors such as errors or\nfailures in systems and technology. Such\nerrors or failures may result in inaccurately\ncalculated NAVs, delays in the\ncalculation of NAVs and/or the inability to\ncalculate NAV over extended time periods. The\nFund may be unable to recover any losses\nassociated with such failures. In the case of\nshares of other funds that are not traded on\nan exchange, a market\nvaluation means such fund\u0092s published net\nasset value per share. The Adviser may use\nvarious pricing services, or discontinue the\nuse of any pricing service, as approved by the\nBoard from time to time. A price obtained from\na pricing service\nbased on such pricing service\u0092s valuation\nmatrix may be considered a market valuation.\n\nIn the event that current market valuations\nare not readily\navailable or are deemed unreliable, the\nTrust\u0092s procedures require the Oversight\nCommittee to determine a security\u0092s fair value\nif a market price is not readily available. In\ndetermining such value the Oversight Committee\nmay consider,\namong other things, (i) price comparisons\namong multiple sources, (ii) a review of\ncorporate actions and news events, and (iii) a\nreview of relevant financial indicators (e.g.,\nmovement in interest rates, market indices,\nand\nprices from the Fund\u0092s Index Provider). In\nthese cases, the Fund\u0092s net asset value may\nreflect certain portfolio securities\u0092 fair\nvalues rather than their market prices. The\nfair value of a portfolio instrument is\ngenerally the price\nwhich the Fund might reasonably expect to\nreceive upon its current sale in an orderly\nmarket between market participants.\nAscertaining fair value requires a\ndetermination of the amount that an\narm\u0092s-length buyer, under the circumstances,\nwould currently pay for the portfolio\ninstrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that\nthe fair value determination for a\nsecurity is materially different than the\nvalue that could be realized upon the sale of\nthe security. In addition, fair value pricing\ncould result in a difference between the\nprices used to calculate the Fund\u0092s net asset\nvalue and the prices\nused by the Fund\u0092s benchmark Index. This may\nresult in a difference between the Fund\u0092s\nperformance and the performance of the Fund\u0092s\nbenchmark Index. With respect to securities\nthat are primarily listed on foreign\nexchanges, the value\nof the Fund\u0092s portfolio securities may change\non days when you will not be able to purchase\nor sell your Shares.\n\nDIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled\n\u0093DISTRIBUTIONS.\u0094\n\nGENERAL POLICIES\n\nDividends from\nnet investment income, if any, are generally\ndeclared and paid monthly by the Fund, but may\nvary significantly from period to period.\nDistributions of net realized securities\ngains, if any, generally are declared and paid\nonce a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more frequent\nbasis for the Fund to improve index tracking\nor to comply with the distribution\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code, in\nall events in a manner consistent with the\nprovisions of the 1940 Act.\n\nDividends and other distributions on Shares\nare distributed, as described below, on a pro\nrata basis to Beneficial Owners of such\nShares. Dividend payments\nare made through DTC Participants and Indirect\nParticipants to Beneficial Owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Trust.\n\nManagement of the\nTrust reserves the right to declare special\ndividends if, in its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or advisable to\npreserve the Fund\u0092s eligibility for treatment\nas a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code or to\navoid imposition of\nincome or excise taxes at the Fund level.\n\nDIVIDEND REINVESTMENT\n\nBroker dealers, at their own discretion, may\noffer a dividend reinvestment service under\nwhich Shares are purchased in the secondary\nmarket at current market\nprices. Investors should consult their broker\ndealer for further information regarding any\ndividend reinvestment service offered by such\nbroker dealer.\n\nTAXES\n\nThe following\nis a summary of certain federal income tax\nconsiderations generally affecting the Fund\nand its shareholders that supplements the\ndiscussion in the Prospectus. No attempt is\nmade to present a comprehensive explanation of\nthe federal, state, local or\nforeign tax treatment of the Fund or its\nshareholders, and the discussion here and in\nthe Prospectus is not intended to be a\nsubstitute for careful tax planning.\n\nThe following general discussion of certain\nfederal income tax consequences is based on\nthe Internal Revenue Code and the regulations\nissued thereunder as in\neffect on the date of this SAI. New\nlegislation, as well as administrative changes\nor court decisions, may significantly change\nthe conclusions expressed herein, and may have\na retroactive effect with respect to the\ntransactions contemplated herein.\n\n41\n\nThe following information should be read in\nconjunction with the section in the Prospectus\nentitled\n\u0093ADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION.\u0094\n\nTAXATION OF THE FUND. The Fund is treated as a\nseparate corporation for federal income tax\npurposes. The Fund\ntherefore is considered to be a separate\nentity in determining its treatment under the\nrules for RICs described herein and in the\nProspectus. Losses in one series of the Trust\ndo not offset gains in any other series of the\nTrust and the requirements\n(other than certain organizational\nrequirements) for qualifying for treatment as\na RIC are determined at the Fund level rather\nthan at the Trust level. The Fund has elected\nor will elect and intends to qualify each year\nto be treated as a separate\nRIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue\nCode. As such, the Fund should not be subject\nto federal income tax on its net investment\nincome and capital gains, if any, to the\nextent that it timely distributes such income\nand capital gains to its\nshareholders. In order to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC, the Fund must distribute\nannually to its shareholders at least the sum\nof 90% of its taxable net investment income\n(generally including the excess of net short-\nterm capital gains over net\nlong-term capital losses) and 90% of its net\ntax exempt interest income, if any (the\n\u0093Distribution Requirement\u0094) and also must meet\nseveral additional requirements. Among these\nrequirements are the following: (i) at least\n90% of the\nFund\u0092s gross income each taxable year must be\nderived from dividends, interest, payments\nwith respect to certain securities loans,\ngains from the sale or other disposition of\nstock, securities or foreign currencies, or\nother income derived with\nrespect to its business of investing in such\nstock, securities or currencies, and net\nincome derived from interests in qualified\npublicly traded partnerships (the \u0093Qualifying\nIncome Requirement\u0094); and (ii) at the end of\neach quarter\nof the Fund\u0092s taxable year, its assets must be\ndiversified so that (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of its total assets must be\nrepresented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other\nsecurities, with such other securities\nlimited, in respect to any one issuer, to an\namount not greater in value than 5% of the\nvalue of the Fund\u0092s total assets and to not\nmore than 10% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of such issuer, and\n(b) not more than 25% of the value of its\ntotal assets is invested in the securities\n(other than U.S. government securities or\nsecurities of other RICs) of any one issuer,\nthe securities (other than securities of other\nRICs) of two or more\nissuers that it controls and that are engaged\nin the same, similar, or related trades or\nbusinesses, or the securities of one or more\nqualified publicly traded partnerships (the\n\u0093Diversification Requirement\u0094).\n\nIf the Fund fails to satisfy the Qualifying\nIncome Requirement or the Diversification\nRequirement in any taxable year, the Fund may\nbe eligible for relief\nprovisions if the failures are due to\nreasonable cause and not willful neglect and\nif a penalty tax is paid with respect to each\nfailure to satisfy the applicable\nrequirements. Additionally, relief is provided\nfor certain de minimis failures\nof the Diversification Requirement where the\nFund corrects the failure within a specified\nperiod of time. In order to be eligible for\nthe relief provisions with respect to a\nfailure to meet the Diversification\nRequirement, the Fund may be required\nto dispose of certain assets. If these relief\nprovisions were not available to the Fund and\nit were to fail to qualify for treatment as a\nRIC for a taxable year, all of its taxable\nincome would be subject to tax at regular\ncorporate rates without\nany deduction for distributions to\nshareholders, and its distributions (including\ncapital gains distributions) generally would\nbe taxable as ordinary income dividends to its\nshareholders, subject to the dividends-\nreceived deduction for corporate\nshareholders and the lower tax rates on\nqualified dividend income received by\nnoncorporate shareholders. To requalify for\ntreatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable\nyear, the Fund would be required to satisfy\nthe RIC qualification requirements for\nthat year and to distribute any earnings and\nprofits from any year in which the Fund failed\nto qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If the\nFund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, it would\ngenerally be required to\npay a Fund-level tax on certain net built-in\ngains recognized with respect to certain of\nits assets upon a disposition of such assets\nwithin five years of qualifying as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. The Board\nreserves the right not to maintain the\nqualification of the Fund for treatment as a\nRIC if it determines such course of action to\nbe beneficial to shareholders.\n\nAs discussed more fully below, the Fund\nintends to distribute substantially all of its\nnet investment income and its capital gains\nfor each taxable year.\n\nIf the Fund meets the Distribution Requirement\nbut retains some or all of its income or\ngains, it will be subject to federal income\ntax to the extent any such\nincome or gains are not distributed. The Fund\nmay designate certain amounts retained as\nundistributed net capital gain in a notice to\nits shareholders, who (i) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as\nlong-term capital gain, their proportionate\nshares of the undistributed amount so\ndesignated, (ii) will be entitled to credit\ntheir proportionate shares of the income tax\npaid by the Fund on that undistributed amount\nagainst their federal\nincome tax liabilities and to claim refunds to\nthe extent such credits exceed their\nliabilities and (iii) will be entitled to\nincrease their tax basis, for federal income\ntax purposes, in their Shares by an amount\nequal to the excess of the\namount of undistributed net capital gain\nincluded in their respective income over their\nrespective income tax credits. If the Fund\nfailed to satisfy the Distribution Requirement\nfor any taxable year, it would be taxed as a\nregular corporation, with\nconsequences generally similar to those\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph.\n\nThe Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on\ncertain undistributed income\nif it does not distribute to its shareholders\nin each calendar year an amount at least equal\nto 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar\nyear plus 98.2% of its capital gain net income\nfor the twelve months ended October 31 of such\nyear,\nsubject to an increase for any shortfall in\nthe prior year\u0092s distribution. The Fund\nintends to declare and distribute dividends\nand distributions in the amounts and at the\ntimes necessary to avoid the application of\nthis 4% excise tax.\n\n42\n\nThe Fund may elect to treat part or all of any\n\u0093qualified late year loss\u0094 as if it had been\nincurred in the succeeding taxable year in\ndetermining the Fund\u0092s taxable income, net\ncapital gain, net short-term capital gain, and\nearnings and profits. The effect of this\nelection is to treat any such \u0093qualified late\nyear loss\u0094 as\nif it had been incurred in the succeeding\ntaxable year in characterizing Fund\ndistributions for any calendar year. A\n\u0093qualified late year loss\u0094 generally includes\nnet capital loss, net long-term capital loss,\nor net short-term capital loss\nincurred after October 31 of the current\ntaxable year (commonly referred to as \u0093post-\nOctober losses\u0094) and certain other late-year\nlosses.\n\nCapital losses in excess of capital gains\n(\u0093net capital losses\u0094) are not permitted to be\ndeducted against a RIC\u0092s net investment\nincome.\nInstead, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\npotentially subject to certain limitations,\nthe Fund may carry a net capital loss from any\ntaxable year forward indefinitely to offset\nits capital gains, if any, in years following\nthe year of the loss.\nTo the extent subsequent capital gains are\noffset by such losses, they will not result in\nU.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund\nand may not be distributed as capital gains to\nits shareholders. Generally, the Fund may not\ncarry forward any\nlosses other than net capital losses.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u0097DISTRIBUTIONS. The\nFund intends to distribute annually to its\nshareholders\nsubstantially all of its investment company\ntaxable income (computed without regard to the\ndeduction for dividends paid), its net tax-\nexempt income, if any, and any net capital\ngain (net recognized long-term\ncapital gains in excess of net recognized\nshort-term capital losses, taking into account\nany capital loss carryforwards). The Fund will\nreport to shareholders annually the amounts of\ndividends paid from ordinary income and the\namount of\ndistributions of net capital gain. Since the\nFund primarily holds investments that do not\npay dividends, it is not expected that a\nsubstantial portion (if any) of the dividends\npaid by the Fund will qualify for either the\ndividends-received\ndeduction for corporations or the favorable\nincome tax rates available to individuals on\nqualified dividend income.\n\nDistributions from the Fund\u0092s\nnet short-term capital gains will generally be\ntaxable to shareholders as ordinary income.\nDistributions from the Fund\u0092s net capital gain\nwill be taxable to shareholders at long-term\ncapital gains rates, regardless of how long\nshareholders have\nheld their Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders\nat rates of up to 20%.\n\nAlthough dividends generally will be\ntreated as distributed when paid, any dividend\ndeclared by the Fund in October, November or\nDecember and payable to shareholders of record\nin such a month that is paid during the\nfollowing January will be treated for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes\nas received by shareholders on December 31 of\nthe calendar year in which it was declared.\n\nIf the Fund\u0092s distributions exceed its\nearnings and\nprofits, all or a portion of the distributions\nmade in the taxable year may be treated as a\nreturn of capital to shareholders. A return of\ncapital distribution generally will not be\ntaxable but will reduce the shareholder\u0092s cost\nbasis and\nresult in a higher capital gain or lower\ncapital loss when the Shares on which the\ndistribution was received are sold. After a\nshareholder\u0092s basis in the Shares has been\nreduced to zero, distributions in excess of\nearnings and profits will be\ntreated as gain from the sale of the\nshareholder\u0092s Shares.\n\nDistributions that are reinvested in\nadditional Shares through the means of a\ndividend\nreinvestment service, if offered by your\nbroker-dealer, will nevertheless be taxable\ndividends to the same extent as if such\ndividends had been received in cash.\n\nA 3.8% Medicare contribution tax generally\napplies to all or a portion of the net\ninvestment income of a shareholder who is an\nindividual and not a\nnonresident alien for federal income tax\npurposes and who has adjusted gross income\n(subject to certain adjustments) that exceeds\na threshold amount ($250,000 if married filing\njointly or if considered a \u0093surviving spouse\u0094\nfor federal\nincome tax purposes, $125,000 if married\nfiling separately, and $200,000 in other\ncases). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a\nportion of the undistributed net investment\nincome of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. For these\npurposes, interest, dividends and certain\ncapital gains (generally including capital\ngain distributions and capital gains realized\non the sale of Shares) are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder\u0092s net\ninvestment income.\n\nDistributions of ordinary income and capital\ngains may also be subject to foreign, state\nand local taxes depending on a shareholder\u0092s\ncircumstances.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS \u0096 SALE OF SHARES. In\ngeneral, a sale of Shares results in capital\ngain or loss, and for individual shareholders,\nis taxable at a\nfederal rate dependent upon the length of time\nthe Shares were held. A sale of Shares held\nfor a period of one year or less at the time\nof such sale will, for tax purposes, generally\nresult in short-term capital gains or losses,\nand a sale of those\nheld for more than one year will generally\nresult in long-term capital gains or losses.\nLong-term capital gains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at rates of up to\n20%.\n\nGain or loss on the sale of Shares is measured\nby the difference between the amount received\nand the adjusted tax basis of the Shares.\nShareholders should\nkeep records of investments made (including\nShares acquired through reinvestment of\ndividends and distributions) so they can\ncompute the tax basis of their Shares.\n\n43\n\nA loss realized on a sale of Shares may be\ndisallowed if substantially identical Shares\nare acquired\n(whether through the reinvestment of dividends\nor otherwise) within a sixty-one (61) day\nperiod beginning thirty (30) days before and\nending thirty (30) days after the date that\nthe Shares are\ndisposed of. In such a case, the basis of the\nShares acquired must be adjusted to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss upon the sale of\nShares held for six (6) months or less will be\ntreated as a long-term capital loss to the\nextent of any\namounts treated as distributions to the\nshareholder of long-term capital gain\n(including any amounts credited to the\nshareholder as undistributed capital gains).\n\nCOST BASIS REPORTING. The cost basis of Shares\nacquired by purchase will generally be based\non the amount paid for the Shares and then may\nbe subsequently\nadjusted for other applicable transactions as\nrequired by the Internal Revenue Code. The\ndifference between the selling price and the\ncost basis of Shares generally determines the\namount of the capital gain or loss realized on\nthe sale or exchange\nof Shares.

Dividends and\ninterest received by the Fund on foreign\nsecurities may give rise to withholding and\nother taxes imposed by\nforeign countries. Tax conventions between\ncertain countries and the United States may\nreduce or eliminate such taxes. The Fund does\nnot expect to satisfy the requirements for\npassing through to its shareholders any share\nof any foreign taxes paid\nby the Fund, with the result that shareholders\nwill not include such taxes in their gross\nincomes and will not be entitled to a tax\ndeduction or credit for such taxes on their\nown returns.\n\nCertain Fund investments may be subject to\ncomplex provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode (including provisions relating to hedging\ntransactions, straddles,\nintegrated transactions, foreign currency\ncontracts, forward foreign currency contracts,\nand notional principal contracts) that, among\nother things, may affect the character of\ngains and losses realized by the Fund (i.e.,\nmay affect whether\ngains or losses are ordinary or capital),\naccelerate recognition of income to the Fund\nand defer losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also may require the Fund\nto mark-to-market certain types of positions\nin its portfolio (i.e., treat them as if they\nwere closed out) which may cause the Fund to\nrecognize income without\nreceiving cash with which to make\ndistributions in amounts necessary to satisfy\nthe RIC distribution requirements for avoiding\nincome and excise taxes. The Fund intends to\nmonitor its transactions, intends to make\nappropriate tax elections, and\nintends to make appropriate entries in its\nbooks and records in order to mitigate the\neffect of these rules and preserve the Fund\u0092s\nqualification for treatment as a RIC.\n\nThe Fund is required for federal income tax\npurposes to mark-to-market and\nrecognize as income for each taxable year its\nnet unrealized gains and losses on certain\nfutures contracts as of the end of the year as\nwell as those actually realized during the\nyear. Gain or loss from futures and options\ncontracts on broad-based\nindexes required to be marked to market will\nbe 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital\ngain or loss. Application of this rule may\nalter the timing and character of\ndistributions to shareholders. The Fund may be\nrequired to defer the recognition of\nlosses on futures contracts, options contracts\nand swaps to the extent of any unrecognized\ngains on offsetting positions held by the\nFund. It is anticipated that certain net gain\nrealized from the closing out of futures or\noptions contracts will be\nconsidered gain from the sale of securities\nand therefore will be qualifying income for\npurposes of the Qualifying Income Requirement.\n\nInvestments by the\nFund in zero coupon or other discount\nsecurities will result in income to the Fund\nequal to a portion of the excess face value of\nthe securities over their issue price (the\n\u0093original issue discount\u0094 or \u0093OID\u0094) each year\nthat the\nsecurities are held, even though the Fund may\nreceive no cash interest payments or may\nreceive cash interest payments that are less\nthan the income recognized for tax purposes.\nIn other circumstances, whether pursuant to\nthe terms of a security or\nas a result of other factors outside the\ncontrol of the Fund, the Fund may recognize\nincome without receiving a commensurate amount\nof cash. Such income is included in\ndetermining the amount of income that the Fund\nmust distribute to maintain its\neligibility for treatment as a RIC and to\navoid the payment of federal income tax,\nincluding the nondeductible 4% excise tax\ndescribed above.\n\nAny market\ndiscount recognized on a market discount bond\nis taxable as ordinary income. A market\ndiscount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue, or below adjusted issue price if issued\nwith original issue discount.\nAbsent an election by the Fund to include the\nmarket discount in income as it accrues, gain\non the Fund\u0092s disposition of such an\nobligation will be treated as ordinary income\nrather than capital gain to the extent of the\naccrued market\ndiscount. Where the income required to be\nrecognized as a result of the OID and/or\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by the Fund, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or\ndispose of securities to enable the Fund\nto make distributions to its shareholders in\norder to qualify for treatment as a RIC and\neliminate taxes at the Fund level.\n\nSpecial rules apply if the\nFund holds inflation-indexed bonds, such as\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities\n(TIPS). Generally, all stated interest on\ninflation-indexed bonds is taken into income\nby the Fund under its regular method of\naccounting for interest income. The\namount of any positive inflation adjustment\nfor a taxable year, which results from an\nincrease in the inflation-adjusted principal\namount of the bond, is treated as OID. The\namount of the Fund\u0092s OID in a taxable year\nwith respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund\u0092s taxable income for such\nyear without a corresponding receipt of cash,\nuntil the bond matures. As a result, the Fund\nmay need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for the\napplicable year. The\namount of any negative inflation adjustments,\n\n44\n\nwhich result from a decrease in the inflation-\nadjusted principal amount of the bond, first\nreduces the amount of interest (including\nstated interest, OID, and market discount, if\nany) otherwise\nincludable in the Fund\u0092s taxable income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year; any\nremaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain\ncircumstances, carried forward to reduce the\namount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the\nbond in future taxable years.\n\nTAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS. Certain tax-exempt\nshareholders, including qualified pension\nplans, individual retirement accounts, salary\ndeferral arrangements, 401(k) plans, and other\ntax-exempt entities,\ngenerally are exempt from federal income\ntaxation except with respect to their\nunrelated business taxable income (\u0093UBTI\u0094).\nUnder current law, the Fund generally serves\nto block UBTI from being realized by its\ntax-exempt shareholders. However,\nnotwithstanding the foregoing, tax-exempt\nshareholders could realize UBTI by virtue of\ntheir investment in the Fund where, for\nexample,\n(i) the Fund invests in REITs that hold\nresidual interests in real estate mortgage\ninvestment conduits (\u0093REMICs\u0094) or (ii) Shares\nconstitute debt-financed property in the hands\nof the\ntax-exempt shareholders within the meaning of\nsection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCharitable remainder trusts are subject to\nspecial rules and should consult their tax\nadvisors. The IRS has issued\nguidance with respect to these issues and\nprospective shareholders, especially\ncharitable remainder trusts, are strongly\nencouraged to consult with their tax advisors\nregarding these issues.\n\nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions\nwill be subject to a 1.4% tax on net\ninvestment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Shares (among other categories\nof income), are generally taken into account\nin computing a shareholder\u0092s net investment\nincome.\n\nFOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends, other than\ncapital gains dividends, \u0093short-term capital\ngain dividends\u0094 and \u0093interest-related\ndividends\u0094\n(described below), paid by the Fund to\nshareholders who are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities will be subject to a 30%\nUnited States withholding tax unless a reduced\nrate of withholding or a withholding exemption\nis provided under applicable\ntreaty law to the extent derived from\ninvestment income and short-term capital gain\nor unless such income is effectively connected\nwith a U.S. trade or business carried on\nthrough a permanent establishment in the\nUnited States. Nonresident\nshareholders are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning the applicability of\nthe United States withholding tax and the\nproper withholding form(s) to be submitted to\nthe Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an appropriate IRS Form\nW-8 may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate.\n\nDividends reported by the Fund as (i)\ninterest-related dividends, to the extent such\ndividends are derived from the Fund\u0092s\n\u0093qualified net\ninterest income,\u0094 or (ii) short-term capital\ngain dividends, to the extent such dividends\nare derived from the Fund\u0092s \u0093qualified short-\nterm gain,\u0094 are generally exempt from this 30%\nwithholding tax. \u0093Qualified net\ninterest income\u0094 is the Fund\u0092s net income\nderived from U.S.-source interest and original\nissue discount, subject to certain exceptions\nand limitations. \u0093Qualified short-term gain\u0094\ngenerally means the excess of the Fund\u0092s net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nover its net long-term capital loss, if any.\nIn the case of Shares held through an\nintermediary, the intermediary may withhold\neven if the Fund reports the payment as an\ninterest-related dividend or as a\nshort-term capital gain dividend. Non-U.S.\nshareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts.\n\nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold\nShares comply with IRS requirements that will\ngenerally require them to\nreport information regarding U.S. persons\ninvesting in, or holding accounts with, such\nentities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to\nFund distributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S. shareholder may be\nexempt from the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement.\n\nBACKUP WITHHOLDING. The Fund will be required\nin certain cases to withhold (as \u0093backup\nwithholding\u0094) on amounts payable to any\nshareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas\nfailed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup\nwithholding will not be applied to payments\nthat have been subject to the 30% withholding\ntax on shareholders who are neither citizens\nnor permanent residents of the U.S.\n\nCREATION UNITS. An Authorized Participant who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units\ngenerally will recognize a gain or a loss. The\ngain or loss will be\nequal to the difference between the market\nvalue of the Creation Units at the time and\nthe sum of the exchanger\u0092s aggregate basis in\nthe securities surrendered plus the amount of\ncash paid for such Creation Units. A person\nwho redeems Creation\nUnits will generally recognize a gain or loss\nequal to the difference between the\nexchanger\u0092s basis in the Creation Units and\nthe sum of the aggregate market value of any\nsecurities received plus the amount of any\ncash received for such\nCreation Units. The IRS, however, may assert\nthat a loss realized upon an exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing\n\u0093wash sales,\u0094 or on the basis that there has\nbeen no significant\nchange in economic position.\n\nAny gain or loss realized upon a creation of\nCreation Units will be treated as capital gain\nor loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the securities exchanged\ntherefor as capital assets, and otherwise will\nbe ordinary income or loss. Similarly, any\ngain or loss realized upon a redemption of\nCreation Units will be treated as capital gain\nor loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Shares comprising the\n\n45\n\nCreation Units as capital assets, and\notherwise will be ordinary income or loss. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon the\ncreation of Creation Units will generally be\ntreated as long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the securities\nexchanged for such Creation Units have been\nheld for more than one year, and otherwise\nwill be short-term capital gain or loss. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon the\nredemption of Creation Units will\ngenerally be treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss if the Shares comprising the Creation\nUnits have been held for more than one year,\nand otherwise, will generally be short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Any capital loss\nrealized upon a redemption\nof Creation Units held for six (6) months or\nless will be treated as a long-term capital\nloss to the extent of any amounts treated as\ndistributions to the applicable Authorized\nParticipant of long-term capital gains with\nrespect to the Creation\nUnits (including any amounts credited to the\nAuthorized Participant as undistributed\ncapital gains).\n\nThe Fund has the right to reject an order for\nCreation Units if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Shares\nso ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding\nshares of the Fund and if, pursuant to section\n351 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund\nwould have a basis\nin any deposit securities different from the\nmarket value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. The Fund also has the right to\nrequire information necessary to determine\nbeneficial Share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the\nFund does issue Creation Units to a purchaser\n(or a group of purchasers) that would, upon\nobtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or\nmore of the outstanding Shares, the purchaser\n(or a group of purchasers) may not recognize\ngain or loss upon the\nexchange of securities for Creation Units.\n\nPersons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units\nshould consult their own tax advisors with\nrespect to the tax\ntreatment of any creation or redemption\ntransaction.\n\nCERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\nUnder promulgated Treasury regulations, if a\nshareholder recognizes a loss on disposition\nof the Fund\u0092s shares of $2 million or more for\nan individual shareholder or $10 million or\nmore for a corporate shareholder (or certain\ngreater amounts over a combination of years),\nthe\nshareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A\nshareholder who fails to make the required\ndisclosure to the IRS may be subject to\nadverse tax consequences, including\nsignificant penalties. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of\nwhether the taxpayer\u0092s treatment of the loss\nis proper. Shareholders should consult their\ntax advisers to determine the applicability of\nthese regulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances.\n\nThe foregoing discussion is a summary only and\nis not intended as a substitute for careful\ntax planning. Purchasers of Shares should\nconsult their own tax\nadvisors as to the tax consequences of\ninvesting in such Shares, including under\nstate, local and other tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date hereof. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.\n\nCAPITAL STOCK AND SHAREHOLDER REPORTS\n\nThe Fund issues Shares of beneficial interest,\npar value $.01 per Share. The Board may\ndesignate additional funds.\n\nEach Share issued by the Trust has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of the corresponding\nseries of the Trust. Shares have no\npreemptive, exchange,\nsubscription or conversion rights and are\nfreely transferable. Each Share is entitled to\nparticipate equally in dividends and\ndistributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the Fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of the Fund on\nliquidation.\n\nEach Share has one vote with respect to\nmatters upon which a shareholder vote is\nrequired consistent with the requirements of\nthe 1940 Act\nand the rules promulgated thereunder. Shares\nof all series of the Trust (\u0093Funds\u0094) vote\ntogether as a single class except that if the\nmatter being voted on affects only a\nparticular fund it will be voted on only by\nthat fund and if a matter\naffects a particular fund differently from\nother Funds, that fund will vote separately on\nsuch matter. Under Massachusetts law, the\nTrust is not required to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. The\npolicy of the Trust is not to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights for the election of Trustees.\nUnder Massachusetts\nlaw, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by\nvote of the shareholders.\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, shareholders of a\nbusiness trust may, under certain\ncircumstances, be held personally liable as\npartners for obligations of the Trust.\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an\nexpress disclaimer of shareholder liability\nfor acts or obligations of the Trust, requires\nthat Trust obligations\ninclude such disclaimer, and provides for\nindemnification and reimbursement of expenses\nout of the Trust\u0092s property for any\nshareholder held personally liable for the\nobligations of the Trust. Thus, the risk of a\nshareholder incurring financial\nloss on account of shareholder liability is\nlimited to circumstances in which the Trust\nitself would be unable to meet its\nobligations. Given the above limitations on\nshareholder personal liability, and the nature\nof the Fund\u0092s assets and\noperations, the risk to shareholders of\npersonal liability is believed to be remote.\n\n46\n\nShareholder inquiries may be made by writing\nto the Trust, c/o the Distributor, State\nStreet Global Advisors\nFunds Distributors, LLC at One Iron Street,\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210.\n\nCOUNSEL AND INDEPENDENT REGISTERED\nPUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 1111 Pennsylvania\nAvenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, serves as\ncounsel to the Trust.\nErnst & Young LLP, located at 200 Clarendon\nStreet, Boston, MA 02116, serves as the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nof the Trust. Ernst & Young LLP performs\nannual audits of the Fund\u0092s financial\nstatements and\nprovides other audit, tax and related\nservices.\n\nLOCAL MARKET HOLIDAY SCHEDULES\n\nThe Trust generally intends to effect\ndeliveries of portfolio securities on a basis\nof \u0093T\u0094 plus two Business Days (i.e., days on\nwhich the NYSE is\nopen)in the relevant foreign market of the\nFund. The ability of the Trust to effect in-\nkind redemptions within two Business Days of\nreceipt of a redemption request is subject to,\namong other things,\nthe condition that, within the time period\nfrom the date of the request to the date of\ndelivery of the securities, there are no days\nthat are local market holidays on the relevant\nBusiness Days. For every occurrence of one or\nmore intervening\nholidays in the local market that are not\nholidays observed in the United States, the\nredemption settlement cycle may be extended by\nthe number of such intervening local holidays.\nIn addition to holidays, other unforeseeable\nclosings in a foreign\nmarket due to emergencies may also prevent the\nTrust from delivering securities within two\nBusiness Days.\n\nThe securities delivery cycles currently\npracticable for transferring portfolio\nsecurities to redeeming investors, coupled\nwith local market holiday schedules, may\nrequire a delivery process longer than the\nstandard settlement period. In certain\ncircumstances during the calendar year, the\nsettlement period may be greater than seven\ncalendar days. Such periods are listed in the\ntable below, as are instances where more than\nseven days will be needed to deliver\nredemption proceeds. Since certain holidays\nmay occur on different dates in\nsubsequent years, the number of days required\nto deliver redemption proceeds in any given\nyear may exceed the maximum number of days\nlisted in the table below. The proclamation of\nnew holidays, the treatment by market\nparticipants of certain days as\n\u0093informal holidays\u0094 (e.g., days on which no or\nlimited securities transactions occur, as a\nresult of substantially shortened trading\nhours), the elimination of existing holidays,\nor changes in local securities delivery\npractices,\ncould affect the information set forth herein\nat some time in the future and longer (worse)\nredemption periods are possible.\n\nListed below are the dates\nin calendar year 2020 (the only year for which\nholidays are known at the time of this SAI\nfiling) in which the regular holidays in\nnon-U.S. markets may impact Fund settlement.\nThis list is based on information\navailable to the Fund. The list may not be\naccurate or complete and is subject to change:\n                                              \n  Alb\u2026    Arge\u2026    Austr\u2026    Aust\u2026    Bahra\u2026  \n

We maximize our voting power and  \n  engagement by maintaining a centralized     \n  proxy voting and active ownership process   \n  covering all holdings, regardless of        \n  strategy. Despite the vast investment       \n  strategies and objectives across State      \n  Street                                      \n  Global Advisors, the fiduciary              \n  responsibilities of share ownership and     \n  voting for which State Street Global        \n  Advisors has voting discretion are carried  \n  out with a single voice and objective.      \n  The Principles support governance           \n  structures that we believe add to, or       \n  maximize shareholder value, for the         \n  companies held in our clients\u0092 portfolios.   \n  We conduct issuer specific engagements      \n  with companies to discuss our               \n  principles, including sustainability        \n  related risks. In addition, we encourage    \n  issuers to find ways to increase the        \n  amount of direct communication board        \n  members have with shareholders. Direct      \n  communication with executive board members  \n  and independent                             \n  non-executive directors is critical to      \n  helping companies understand shareholder    \n  concerns. Conversely, we conduct            \n  collaborative engagement activities with    \n  multiple shareholders and communicate with  \n  company                                     \n  representatives about common concerns       \n  where appropriate.                          \n  In conducting our engagements, we also      \n  evaluate the various factors that           \n  influence the corporate governance          \n  framework of a country, including the       \n  macroeconomic conditions and broader        \n  political system, the quality of            \n  regulatory                                  \n  oversight, the enforcement of property and  \n  shareholder rights, and the independence    \n  of the judiciary. We understand that        \n  regulatory requirements and investor        \n  expectations relating to governance         \n  practices and engagement activities differ  \n  from country                                \n  to country. As a result, we engage with     \n  issuers, regulators, or a combination of    \n  the two depending upon the market. We are   \n  also a member of various investor           \n  associations that seek to address broader   \n  corporate governance related policy at the  \n  country                                     \n  level as well as issuer- specific concerns  \n  at a company level.                         \n  The State Street Global Advisors Asset      \n  Stewardship Team may collaborate with       \n  members of the Active Fundamental and       \n  various other investment teams to engage    \n  with companies on corporate governance      \n  issues and to address any specific          \n  concerns. This facilitates our              \n  comprehensive approach to information       \n  gathering as it relates to shareholder      \n  items that are to be voted upon at          \n  upcoming shareholder meetings. We also      \n  conduct issuer-specific engagements with    \n  companies covering various                  \n  corporate governance and sustainability     \n  related topics outside of proxy season.     \n  The Asset Stewardship Team employs a blend  \n  of quantitative and qualitative research,   \n  analysis, and data in order to support      \n  screens that identify issuers where active  \n  engagement may be necessary to protect and  \n  promote shareholder                         \n  value. Issuer engagement may also be event  \n  driven, focusing on issuer-specific         \n  corporate governance, sustainability        \n  concerns, or more broad industry-related    \n  trends. We also consider the size of our    \n  total position of the issuer in question    \n  and/or the                                  \n  potential negative governance, performance  \n  profile, and circumstance at hand. As a     \n  result, we believe issuer engagement can    \n  take many forms and be triggered by         \n  numerous circumstances. The following       \n  approaches represent how we define          \n  engagement                                  \n  methods:                                    \n  Active We use screening tools designed to   \n  capture a mix of company-specific data      \n  including governance and sustainability     \n  profiles to help us focus our voting and    \n  engagement activity. We will actively seek  \n  direct dialogue with                        \n  the board and management of companies that  \n  we have identified through our screening    \n  processes. Such engagements may lead to     \n  further monitoring to ensure that the       \n  company improves its governance or          \n  sustainability practices. In these cases,   \n  the                                         \n  engagement process represents the most      \n  meaningful opportunity for us to protect    \n  long-term shareholder value from excessive  \n  risk due to poor governance and             \n  sustainability practices.                   \n                                              \nB-2\n                                              \n                        Reactive Reactive     \n                        engagement is         \n                        initiated by the      \n                        issuers.

In order   \n                        to carry out their    \n                        primary               \n                        responsibilities,     \n                        directors have        \n                        to undertake          \n                        activities that       \n                        range from setting    \n  Directors and         strategy and          \n  Boards                overseeing executive  \n                        management, to        \n                        monitoring the risks  \n                        that arise from a     \n                        company\u0092s business,    \n                        including risks       \n                        related to            \n                        sustainability        \n                        issues. Further,      \n                        good corporate        \n                        governance            \n                        necessitates the      \n                        existence of          \n                        effective internal    \n                        controls and risk     \n                        management systems,   \n                        which should be       \n                        governed by the       \n                        board.                \n                                              \nB-25\n                                              \n  We believe that a well constituted board    \n  of directors, with a balance of skills,     \n  expertise and independence, provides the    \n  foundations for                             \n  a well governed company. We view board      \n  quality as a measure of director            \n  independence, director succession           \n  planning, board diversity, evaluations and  \n  refreshment, and company governance         \n  practices. We vote for the                  \n  election/re-election of directors on a      \n  case-by-case basis after considering        \n  various factors, including board quality,   \n  general                                     \n  market practice, and availability of        \n  information on director skills and          \n  expertise. In principle, we believe         \n  independent directors are crucial to good   \n  corporate governance and help management    \n  establish sound corporate governance        \n  policies and practices. A sufficiently      \n  independent board will most effectively     \n  monitor management and perform oversight    \n  functions necessary to protect shareholder  \n  interests.                                  \n  Our broad criteria for director             \n  independence in                             \n  European companies include factors such     \n  as:                                         \n  \u0095\u2003\u200aParticipation in related\u0096party             \n  transactions and other business             \n  relations with the company                  \n  \u0095\u2003\u200aEmployment history with the company       \n  \u0095\u2003\u200aRelations with controlling shareholders   \n  \u0095\u2003\u200aFamily ties with any of the company\u0092s      \n  advisers, directors or senior               \n  employees                                   \n  \u0095 Serving as an employee or government       \n  representative and                          \n  \u0095\u2003\u200aOverall average board tenure and          \n  individual director tenure at issuers with  \n  classified and de-classified boards,        \n  respectively                                \n  \u0095\u2003\u200aCompany classification of a director as   \n  non-independent                             \n  While overall board independence            \n  requirements and board structures differ    \n  from market to market, we consider voting   \n  against directors we deem non-independent   \n  if overall board independence               \n  is below one-third or if overall            \n  independence level is below 50% after       \n  excluding employee representatives and/or   \n  directors elected in accordance with local  \n  laws who are not elected by shareholders.   \n  We may                                      \n  withhold support for a proposal to          \n  discharge the board if a company fails to   \n  meet adequate governance standards or       \n  board level independence.                   \n  We also assess the division of              \n  responsibilities between chair and CEO on   \n  a case-by-case basis, giving consideration  \n  to factors such as overall level            \n  of independence on the board and general    \n  corporate governance standards in the       \n  company. However, we may take voting        \n  action against the chair or members of the  \n  nominating committee at the STOXX Europe    \n  600 companies that have combined the roles  \n  of                                          \n  chair and CEO and have not appointed an     \n  independent deputy chair or a lead          \n  independent director.                       \n  When voting on the election or re-election  \n  of a director, we also consider the number  \n  of outside board directorships a            \n  non-executive and an executive              \n  may undertake. Thus, we may withhold votes  \n  from board chairs and lead independent      \n  directors who sit on more than three        \n  public company boards, and from             \n  non-executive directors who hold more than  \n  four public                                 \n  company board mandates. We may also take    \n  voting action against named executive       \n  officers who undertake more than two        \n  public board memberships.                   \n  We also consider attendance at board        \n  meetings and may withhold votes from        \n  directors who attend less than 75% of       \n  board meetings without appropriate          \n  explanation or providing reason for their   \n  failure to meet the attendance threshold    \n  .. In addition, we monitor other factors    \n  that may influence the independence of a    \n  non-executive director, such as             \n  performance-related pay,                    \n  cross-directorships and significant         \n  shareholdings. Moreover, we may             \n  vote against the election of a director     \n  whose biographical disclosures are          \n  insufficient to assess his or her role on   \n  the board and/or independence.              \n  Further, we expect boards of STOXX Europe   \n  600 listed companies to have at least one   \n  female board member. If a company fails to  \n  meet this expectation, State Street Global  \n  Advisors may vote against the Chair of the  \n  board\u0092s                                      \n  nominating committee or the board leader    \n  in the absence of a nominating committee,   \n  if necessary.                               \n  Although we generally are in favour of the  \n  annual election of directors, we recognise  \n  that director terms vary considerably in    \n  different European markets. We may vote     \n  against article/bylaw changes that seek to  \n  extend director                             \n  terms. In addition, we may vote against     \n  directors if their terms extend beyond      \n  four years in certain markets.              \n                                              \nB-26\n                                              \n                        We believe companies  \n                        should have relevant  \n                        board level           \n                        committees for        \n                        audit, remuneration   \n                        and nomination        \n                        oversight.
