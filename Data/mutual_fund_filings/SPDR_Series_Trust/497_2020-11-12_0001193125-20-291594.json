The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nThe offering of the Fund\u0092s shares (\u0093Shares\u0094)\nis registered under the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended (the \u0093Securities Act\u0094). The\ninvestment objective of the Fund is to provide\ninvestment results that, before fees and\nexpenses, correspond generally to the total\nreturn performance of a specified market index\n(the \u0093Index\u0094). SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\nserves as the investment adviser for the Fund\n(\u0093SSGA FM\u0094 or the \u0093Adviser\u0094).\n\nThe Fund offers and issues Shares at their net\nasset value (sometimes referred to herein as\n\u0093NAV\u0094) only in aggregations of a specified\nnumber of\nShares (each, a \u0093Creation Unit\u0094). The Fund\ngenerally offers and issues Shares either in\nexchange for (i) a basket of securities\ndesignated by the Fund (\u0093Deposit Securities\u0094)\ntogether with the deposit of a specified cash\npayment (\u0093Cash Component\u0094) or (ii) a cash\npayment equal in value to the Deposit\nSecurities (\u0093Deposit Cash\u0094) together with the\nCash Component. The primary consideration\naccepted by the Fund (i.e., Deposit Securities\nor\nDeposit Cash) is set forth under \u0093Purchase and\nRedemption of Creation Units\u0094 later in this\nSAI. The Trust reserves the right to permit or\nrequire the substitution of a \u0093cash in lieu\u0094\namount to be added to the Cash Component to\nreplace any Deposit Security and reserves the\nright to permit or require the substitution of\nDeposit Securities in lieu of Deposit Cash\n(subject to applicable legal requirements).\nThe Shares have been approved for listing and\nsecondary trading on a\nnational securities exchange (the \u0093Exchange\u0094).\nThe Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nmarket prices. These prices may differ from\nthe Shares\u0092 net asset values. The Shares are\nalso redeemable only in Creation Unit\naggregations, and\ngenerally in exchange either for (i) portfolio\nsecurities and a specified cash payment or\n(ii) cash (subject to applicable legal\nrequirements).\n\nShares may be issued in advance of receipt of\nDeposit Securities subject to various\nconditions including a requirement to maintain\non deposit with the Trust\ncash at least equal to a specified percentage\nof the market value of the missing Deposit\nSecurities, as set forth in the Participant\nAgreement (as defined below). See \u0093Purchase\nand Redemption of Creation Units.\u0094 The Trust\nmay impose a\ntransaction fee for each creation or\nredemption. In all cases, such fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u0093SEC\u0094) applicable to management investment\ncompanies offering\nredeemable securities. In addition to the\nfixed creation or redemption transaction fee,\nan additional transaction fee of up to three\ntimes the fixed creation or redemption\ntransaction fee and/or an additional variable\ncharge may apply.\n\nINVESTMENT POLICIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in the following types of\ninvestments, consistent with its investment\nstrategies and objective. Please see the\nFund\u0092s Prospectus for\nadditional information regarding its principal\ninvestment strategies.\n\nDIVERSIFICATION STATUS\n\nThe Fund is classified as a \u0093non-diversified\u0094\ninvestment company under the 1940 Act. A \u0093non-\ndiversified\u0094 classification means that the\nFund is not limited by the 1940 Act with\nregard to the percentage of its assets that\nmay be invested in the securities of a single\nissuer. This means that\nthe Fund may invest a greater portion of its\nassets in the securities of a single issuer\nthan a diversified fund. The securities of a\nparticular issuer may constitute a greater\nportion of the Index of the Fund and,\ntherefore, the securities may\nconstitute a greater portion of the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio. This may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund\u0092s performance or subject the Fund\u0092s\nShares to greater price volatility than more\ndiversified investment companies.\n\nThe Fund intends to maintain the required\nlevel of diversification and otherwise conduct\nits operations so as to qualify as a\n\u0093regulated investment\ncompany\u0094 (\u0093RIC\u0094) for purposes of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\u0093Internal Revenue Code\u0094), and to relieve the\nFund of any liability for federal income tax\nto the extent that its earnings are\ndistributed to\nshareholders. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may severely limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective.\n\nASSET-BACKED AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED\nSECURITIES\n\nAsset-backed securities are securities backed\nby installment contracts, credit-card\nreceivables or other assets. Commercial\nmortgage-backed securities are\nsecurities backed by commercial real estate\nproperties. Both asset-backed and commercial\nmortgage-backed securities represent interests\nin \u0093pools\u0094 of assets in which payments of both\ninterest and principal on the securities are\nmade on a\nregular basis. The payments are, in effect,\n\u0093passed through\u0094 to the holder of the\nsecurities (net of any fees paid to the issuer\nor guarantor of the securities). The average\nlife of asset-backed and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities\nvaries with the maturities of the underlying\ninstruments and, as a result of prepayments,\ncan often be less than the original maturity\nof the assets underlying the securities. For\nthis and other reasons, an asset-backed and\ncommercial\nmortgage-backed security\u0092s stated maturity may\nbe shortened, and the security\u0092s total return\nmay be difficult to predict precisely.\n\n3\n\nBONDS\n\nA bond is an\ninterest-bearing security issued by a company,\ngovernmental unit or, in some cases, a\nnon-U.S. entity. The issuer of a bond has a\ncontractual obligation to pay interest at a\nstated rate on specific dates and\nto repay principal (the bond\u0092s face value)\nperiodically or on a specified maturity date;\nprovided, however, a zero coupon bond pays no\ninterest to its holder during its life. The\nvalue of a zero coupon bond to the Fund\nconsists of the\ndifference between such bond\u0092s face value at\nthe time of maturity and the price for which\nit was acquired, which may be an amount\nsignificantly less than its face value\n(sometimes referred to as a \u0093deep discount\u0094\nprice).\n\nAn issuer may have the right to redeem or\n\u0093call\u0094 a bond before maturity, in which case\nthe investor may have to reinvest the proceeds\nat lower\nmarket rates. Most bonds bear interest income\nat a \u0093coupon\u0094 rate that is fixed for the life\nof the bond. The value of a fixed rate bond\nusually rises when market interest rates fall,\nand falls when market interest rates rise.\nAccordingly,\na fixed rate bond\u0092s yield (income as a percent\nof the bond\u0092s current value) may differ from\nits coupon rate as its value rises or falls.\nFixed rate bonds generally are also subject to\ninflation risk, which is the risk that the\nvalue of the\nbond or income from the bond will be worth\nless in the future as inflation decreases the\nvalue of money. This could mean that, as\ninflation increases, the \u0093real\u0094 value of the\nassets of the Fund holding fixed rate bonds\ncan decline, as can\nthe value of the Fund\u0092s distributions. Other\ntypes of bonds bear income at an interest rate\nthat is adjusted periodically. Because of\ntheir adjustable interest rates, the value of\n\u0093floating-rate\u0094 or \u0093variable-rate\u0094 bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed rate bonds. The Fund may treat some of\nthese bonds as having a shorter maturity for\npurposes of calculating the weighted average\nmaturity of its investment\nportfolio. Bonds may be senior or subordinated\nobligations. Senior obligations generally have\nthe first claim on a corporation\u0092s earnings\nand assets and, in the event of liquidation,\nare paid before subordinated obligations.\nBonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer\u0092s general\ncreditworthiness) or secured (also backed by\nspecified collateral).\n\nThe investment return of\ncorporate bonds reflects interest on the bond\nand changes in the market value of the bond.\nThe market value of a corporate bond may be\naffected by the credit rating of the\ncorporation, the corporation\u0092s performance and\nperceptions of the\ncorporation in the market place. There is a\nrisk that the issuers of the securities may\nnot be able to meet their obligations on\ninterest or principal payments at the time\ncalled for by such a security.\n\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER\n\nCommercial paper consists of short-term,\npromissory notes issued by banks, corporations\nand other entities to finance short-term\ncredit needs. These securities generally are\ndiscounted but sometimes may be interest\nbearing.\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\nThe Fund will concentrate its investments in\nsecurities of issuers in the same industry as\nmay be necessary to approximate the\ncomposition of the Fund\u0092s underlying Index.\nThe securities of issuers in particular\nindustries may dominate the benchmark Index of\nthe Fund and consequently the\nFund\u0092s investment portfolio. This may\nadversely affect the Fund\u0092s performance or\nsubject its Shares to greater price volatility\nthan that experienced by less concentrated\ninvestment companies. The Trust\u0092s general\npolicy is to exclude\nsecurities of the U.S. government and its\nagencies or instrumentalities when measuring\nindustry concentration.\n\nIn pursuing its objective, the Fund may\nhold the securities of a single issuer in an\namount exceeding 10% of the market value of\nthe outstanding securities of the issuer,\nsubject to restrictions imposed by the\nInternal Revenue Code. In particular, as the\nFund\u0092s size grows and its\nassets increase, it will be more likely to\nhold more than 10% of the securities of a\nsingle issuer if the issuer has a relatively\nsmall public float as compared to other\ncomponents in its benchmark Index.\n\nCONVERTIBLE SECURITIES\n\nConvertible securities are bonds,\ndebentures, notes, preferred stock or other\nsecurities that may be converted or exchanged\n(by the holder or by the issuer) into shares\nof the underlying common stock (or cash or\nsecurities of equivalent value) at a stated\nexchange ratio. A\nconvertible security may also be called for\nredemption or conversion by the issuer after a\nparticular date and under certain\ncircumstances (including a specified price)\nestablished upon issue. If a convertible\nsecurity held by the Fund is called for\nredemption or conversion, the Fund could be\nrequired to tender it for redemption, convert\nit into the underlying common stock, or sell\nit to a third party.\n\nConvertible securities generally have less\npotential for gain or loss than common stock.\nConvertible securities generally provide\nyields higher than the\nunderlying common stock, but generally lower\nthan comparable non-convertible securities.\nBecause of this higher yield, convertible\nsecurities generally sell at a price above\ntheir \u0093conversion value,\u0094\nwhich is the current market value of the stock\nto\n\n4\n\nbe received upon conversion. The difference\nbetween this conversion value and the price of\nconvertible securities will vary over time\ndepending on changes in the value of the\nunderlying common\nstock and interest rates. When the underlying\ncommon stock declines in value, convertible\nsecurities will tend not to decline to the\nsame extent because of the interest or\ndividend payments and the repayment of\nprincipal at maturity for certain\ntypes of convertible securities. However,\nsecurities that are convertible other than at\nthe option of the holder generally do not\nlimit the potential for loss to the same\nextent as securities convertible at the option\nof the holder. When the\nunderlying common stock rises in value, the\nvalue of convertible securities may also be\nexpected to increase. At the same time,\nhowever, the difference between the market\nvalue of convertible securities and their\nconversion value will narrow, which\nmeans that the value of convertible securities\nwill generally not increase to the same extent\nas the value of the underlying common stock.\nBecause convertible securities may also be\ninterest-rate sensitive, their value may\nincrease as interest rates\nfall and decrease as interest rates rise.\nConvertible securities are also subject to\ncredit risk, and are often lower-quality\nsecurities.\n\nFUTURES\nCONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in\nderivatives, including exchange-traded futures\non Treasuries or\nEurodollars, U.S. exchange-traded or OTC put\nand call options contracts and exchange-traded\nor OTC swap transactions (including NDFs\ninterest rate swaps, total return swaps,\nexcess return swaps, and credit default\nswaps). The Fund will segregate\ncash and/or appropriate liquid assets if\nrequired to do so by SEC or CFTC regulation or\ninterpretation.\n\nRecent legislation calls for new regulation of\nthe derivatives markets. The extent and impact\nof the regulation is not yet fully known and\nmay not be for some time. New regulations\ncould adversely affect the value, availability\nand performance of certain derivative\ninstruments, may make them\nmore costly, and may limit or restrict their\nuse by the Fund.\n\n5\n\nFutures contracts generally provide for the\nfuture sale by one party and purchase by\nanother party of a specified\ncommodity or security at a specified future\ntime and at a specified price. Index futures\ncontracts are settled daily with a payment by\none party to the other of a cash amount based\non the difference between the level of the\nindex specified in the\ncontract from one day to the next. A futures\ncontract on an index is an agreement pursuant\nto which two parties agree to take or make\ndelivery of an amount of cash equal to the\ndifference between the value of the index at\nthe close of the last\ntrading day of the contract and the price at\nwhich the index contract originally was\nwritten. Although the value of an index might\nbe a function of the value of certain\nspecified securities, physical delivery of\nthese securities is not always made.\nA public market exists in futures contracts\ncovering a number of indexes, as well as\nfinancial instruments, including, without\nlimitation: U.S. Treasury bonds; U.S. Treasury\nnotes; GNMA Certificates; three-month U.S.\nTreasury bills; 90-day commercial paper; bank\ncertificates of deposit; Eurodollar\ncertificates of deposit; the Australian\nDollar; the Canadian Dollar; the British\nPound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss Franc; the\nMexican Peso; and\ncertain multinational currencies, such as the\nEuro. It is expected that other futures\ncontracts will be developed and traded in the\nfuture. Futures contracts are standardized as\nto maturity date and underlying instrument and\nare traded on futures\nexchanges.\n\nThe Fund may purchase and write (sell) call\nand put options on futures. Options on futures\ngive the holder the right, in return for the\npremium paid, to assume a long position (call)\nor short position (put) in a futures contract\nat a specified exercise price upon expiration\nof, or at any time during the period of, the\noption. Upon exercise of a call option, the\nholder acquires a\nlong position in the futures contract and the\nwriter is assigned the opposite short\nposition. In the case of a put option, the\nopposite is true. The Fund is required to make\na good faith margin deposit in cash or U.S.\ngovernment securities (or other\neligible collateral) with a broker or\ncustodian to initiate and maintain open\npositions in futures contracts. A margin\ndeposit is intended to assure completion of\nthe contract (delivery or acceptance of the\nunderlying commodity or payment of the\ncash settlement amount) if it is not\nterminated prior to the specified delivery\ndate. Brokers may establish deposit\nrequirements which are higher than the\nexchange minimums. Futures contracts are\ncustomarily purchased and sold on margin\ndeposits\nwhich may range upward from less than 5% of\nthe value of the contract being traded.\n\nAfter a futures contract position is opened,\nthe value of the\ncontract is marked to market daily. If the\nfutures contract price changes to the extent\nthat the margin on deposit does not satisfy\nprice changes, additional payments will be\nrequired. Conversely, change in the contract\nvalue may reduce the required\nmargin, resulting in a repayment of excess\nmargin to the contract holder. Variation\nmargin payments are made to and from the\nfutures broker for as long as the contract\nremains open. In such case, the Fund would\nexpect to earn interest income on its\nmargin deposits. Although some futures\ncontracts call for making or taking delivery\nof the underlying commodity, generally these\nobligations are closed out prior to delivery\nby offsetting purchases or sales of matching\nfutures contracts (involving\nthe same exchange, underlying security or\nindex and delivery month). If an offsetting\npurchase price is less than the original sale\nprice, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if\nit is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss.\nConversely, if an\noffsetting sale price is more than the\noriginal purchase price, the Fund realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is less, the Fund\nrealizes a capital loss. The transaction costs\nalso must be included in these calculations.\n\n. The Fund intends to use commodity interests,\nsuch as futures, swaps and options on futures\nin accordance\nwith Rule 4.5 of the CEA. The Fund may use\nexchange-traded futures and options on\nfutures, together with positions in cash and\nmoney market instruments, to simulate full\ninvestment in its underlying Index. Exchange-\ntraded futures and options on\nfutures contracts may not be currently\navailable for the Index. Under such\ncircumstances, the Adviser may seek to utilize\nother instruments that it believes to be\ncorrelated to the Index components or a subset\nof the components. An exclusion from\nthe definition of the term \u0093commodity pool\noperator\u0094 has been claimed with respect to\neach series of the Trust in accordance with\nRule 4.5 such that registration or regulation\nas a commodity pool operator under the CEA is\nnot necessary.\n\n. The Fund reserves the right to engage in\ntransactions involving futures, options\nthereon and swaps\nto the extent allowed by the CFTC regulations\nin effect from time to time and in accordance\nwith the Fund\u0092s policies. The Fund would take\nsteps to prevent its futures positions from\n\u0093leveraging\u0094 its securities holdings. When it\nhas a\nlong futures position, it will maintain with\nits custodian bank assets substantially\nidentical to those underlying the contract or\ncash and equivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under\nthe contract (less the value of any margin\ndeposits in connection with the position).\nWhen it has a short futures position, it will\nmaintain with its custodian bank assets\nsubstantially identical to those underlying\nthe contract or cash and\nequivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position).\n\n. The Fund may purchase and sell put and call\noptions. Such options may relate to particular\nsecurities and may or may not be listed on a\nnational securities exchange and issued by the\nOptions Clearing Corporation. Options trading\nis a highly specialized activity that entails\ngreater than ordinary investment risk. Options\non particular securities may be more volatile\nthan the\nunderlying securities, and therefore, on a\npercentage basis, an investment in options may\nbe subject to greater fluctuation than an\ninvestment in the underlying securities\nthemselves.\n\nThe Fund may engage in short sales \u0093against\nthe box.\u0094 In a short sale against the box, the\nFund\nagrees to sell at a future date a security\nthat it either contemporaneously owns or has\nthe right to acquire at no extra cost. If the\nprice of the security has declined at the time\nthe Fund is required to deliver the security,\nthe Fund will benefit\nfrom the difference in the price. If the price\nof the security has increased, the Fund will\nbe required to pay the difference.\n\n6\n\n. The Fund may enter into swap transactions,\nincluding interest rate, swap, credit\ndefault swap, NDF, and total return swap\ntransactions. Swap transactions are contracts\nbetween parties in which one party agrees to\nmake periodic payments to the other party\nbased on the change in market value or level\nof a specified rate, index or\nasset. In return, the other party agrees to\nmake payments to the first party based on the\nreturn of a different specified rate, index or\nasset. Swap transactions will usually be done\non a net basis, i.e., where the two parties\nmake net\npayments with the Fund receiving or paying, as\nthe case may be, only the net amount of the\ntwo payments. The net amount of the excess, if\nany, of the Fund\u0092s obligations over its\nentitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis\nand an amount of cash or equivalents having an\naggregate value at least equal to the accrued\nexcess is maintained by the Fund. Swaps may be\nused in conjunction with other instruments to\noffset interest rate, currency or other\nunderlying risks. For\nexample, interest rate swaps may be offset\nwith \u0093caps,\u0094 \u0093floors\u0094 or \u0093collars\u0094. A \u0093cap\u0094 is\nessentially a call option which places a limit\non the amount of floating rate interest that\nmust be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u0093floor\u0094 is essentially a\nput option which places a limit on the minimum\namount that would be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u0093collar\u0094 is essentially a\ncombination of a long cap and a short floor\nwhere\nthe limits are set at different levels.\n\nThe use of swap transactions by the Fund\nentails certain risks, which may be different\nfrom, or possibly greater\nthan, the risks associated with investing\ndirectly in the securities and other\ninvestments that are the referenced asset for\nthe swap agreement. Swaps are highly\nspecialized instruments that require\ninvestment techniques, risk analyses, and tax\nplanning different from those associated with\nstocks, bonds, and other traditional\ninvestments. The use of a swap requires an\nunderstanding not only of the referenced\nasset, reference rate, or index, but also of\nthe swap itself, without the benefit\nof observing the performance of the swap under\nall the possible market conditions. Because\nsome swap transactions have a leverage\ncomponent, adverse changes in the value or\nlevel of the underlying asset, reference rate,\nor index can result in a loss\nsubstantially greater than the amount invested\nin the swap itself. Certain swaps have the\npotential for unlimited loss, regardless of\nthe size of the initial investment.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (the \u0093Dodd-Frank Act\u0094) that was\nsigned into law on July 21, 2010 created a new\nstatutory framework that comprehensively\nregulated the over-the-counter (\u0093OTC\u0094)\nderivatives markets for the first time. Key\nDodd-Frank Act provisions relating\nto OTC derivatives require rulemaking by the\nSEC and the CFTC, not all of which has been\nproposed or finalized as at the date of this\nSAI. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTC\nderivatives markets were traditionally traded\non a bilateral basis (so-called \u0093bilateral OTC\ntransactions\u0094). Under the Dodd-Frank Act,\ncertain OTC derivatives transactions are now\nrequired to be centrally cleared and traded on\nexchanges or electronic trading platforms\ncalled swap execution facilities (\u0093SEFs\u0094).\n\nBilateral OTC transactions differ from\nexchange-traded or cleared derivatives\ntransactions in\nseveral respects. Bilateral OTC transactions\nare transacted directly with dealers and not\nwith a clearing corporation. Without the\navailability of a clearing corporation,\nbilateral OTC transaction pricing is normally\ndone by reference to information\nfrom market makers and/or available index\ndata, which information is carefully monitored\nby the Adviser and verified in appropriate\ncases. As bilateral OTC transactions are\nentered into directly with a dealer, there is\na risk of nonperformance by\nthe dealer as a result of its insolvency or\notherwise. Under recently-adopted regulations\nby the CFTC and federal banking regulators\n(\u0093Margin Rules\u0094), the Fund is required to post\ncollateral (known as variation margin) to\ncover the mark-to-market exposure in respect\nof its uncleared swaps. The Margin Rules also\nmandate that collateral in the form of initial\nmargin be posted to cover potential future\nexposure attributable to uncleared swap\ntransactions. In the event the Fund is\nrequired to post collateral in the form of\ninitial margin or variation margin in respect\nof its uncleared swap transactions, all such\ncollateral will be posted with a\nthird party custodian pursuant to a triparty\ncustody agreement between the Fund, its dealer\ncounterparty and an unaffiliated custodian.\n\nThe requirement\nto execute certain OTC derivatives contracts\non SEFs may offer certain advantages over\ntraditional bilateral OTC trading, such as\nease of execution, price transparency,\nincreased liquidity and/or favorable pricing.\nHowever, SEF trading may make it\nmore difficult and costly for the Fund to\nenter into highly tailored or customized\ntransactions and may result in additional\ncosts and risks. Market participants such as\nthe Fund that execute derivatives contracts\nthrough a SEF, whether directly or\nthrough a broker intermediary, are required to\nsubmit to the jurisdiction of the SEF and\ncomply with SEF and CFTC rules and regulations\nwhich impose, among other things disclosure\nand recordkeeping obligations. In addition,\nthe Fund will generally\nincur SEF or broker intermediary fees when it\ntrades on a SEF. The Fund may also be required\nto indemnify the SEF or broker intermediary\nfor any losses or costs that may result from\nthe Fund\u0092s transactions on the SEF.\n\n. The Fund may enter into total return swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. Total\nreturn swaps are transactions in which one\nparty agrees to make periodic payments based\non the change in market value of the\nunderlying assets, which may include a\nspecified security, basket of securities or\nsecurity indexes during the specified period,\nin return for periodic payments based\non a fixed or variable interest rate of the\ntotal return from other underlying assets.\nTotal return swaps may be used to obtain\nexposure to a security or market without\nowning or taking physical custody of such\nsecurity or market, including in cases\nin which there may be disadvantages associated\nwith direct ownership of a particular\nsecurity. In a typical total return equity\nswap, payments made by the Fund or the\ncounterparty are based on the total return of\na particular reference asset or\nassets (such as an equity security, a\n\n7\n\ncombination of such securities, or an index).\nThat is, one party agrees to pay another party\nthe return on a stock, basket of stocks, or\nstock index in return for a specified interest\nrate. By\nentering into an equity index swap, for\nexample, the index receiver can gain exposure\nto stocks making up the index of securities\nwithout actually purchasing those stocks.\nTotal return swaps involve not only the risk\nassociated with the investment\nin the underlying securities, but also the\nrisk of the counterparty not fulfilling its\nobligations under the agreement.\n\n. The\nFund may enter into credit default swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. A credit\ndefault swap transaction may have as reference\nobligations one or more securities that are\nnot currently held by the Fund. The Fund may\nbe either the protection\nbuyer or protection seller in the transaction.\nCredit default swaps may also be structured\nbased on the debt of a basket of issuers,\nrather than a single issuer, and may be\ncustomized with respect to the default event\nthat triggers purchase or other\nfactors. As a protection seller, the Fund\nwould generally receive an upfront payment or\na fixed rate of income throughout the term of\nthe swap, which typically is between six\nmonths and three years, provided that there is\nno credit event. If a\ncredit event occurs, generally the protection\nseller must pay the protection buyer the full\nface amount of the reference obligations that\nmay have little or no value. The notional\nvalue of the credit default swap will be used\nto segregate liquid\nassets for selling protection on credit\ndefault swaps. If the Fund were a protection\nbuyer and no credit event occurred during the\nterm of the swap, the Fund would recover\nnothing if the swap were held through its\ntermination date. However, if a\ncredit event occurred, the protection buyer\nmay elect to receive the full notional value\nof the swap in exchange for an equal face\namount of the reference obligation that may\nhave little or no value. Where the Fund is the\nprotection buyer, credit\ndefault swaps involve the risk that the seller\nmay fail to satisfy its payment obligations to\nthe Fund in the event of a default. The\npurchase of credit default swaps involves\ncosts, which will reduce the Fund\u0092s return.\nWhen the Fund buys\ncredit default swaps it will segregate an\namount at least equal to the amount of any\naccrued premium payment obligations including\namounts for early terminations.\n\n. The Fund may enter into currency swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. Currency\nswaps are similar to interest rate swaps,\nexcept\nthat they involve multiple currencies. The\nFund may enter into a currency swap when it\nhas exposure to one currency and desires\nexposure to a different currency. Typically,\nthe interest rates that determine the currency\nswap payments are fixed,\nalthough occasionally one or both parties may\npay a floating rate of interest. Unlike an\ninterest rate swap, however, the principal\namounts are exchanged at the beginning of the\ncontract and returned at the end of the\ncontract. In addition to paying\nand receiving amounts at the beginning and end\nof the transaction, both sides will have to\npay in full on a periodic basis based upon the\ncurrency they have borrowed. Change in foreign\nexchange rates and changes in interest rates,\nas described\nabove, may negatively affect currency swaps.\n\n. The Fund may enter into an interest rate\nswap in an effort to protect against\ndeclines in the value of fixed income\nsecurities held by the Fund. In such an\ninstance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed\nrate (multiplied by a notional amount) while a\ncounterparty agrees to pay a floating rate\n(multiplied by the same notional\namount). If interest rates rise, resulting in\na diminution in the value of the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio, the Fund would receive payments\nunder the swap that would offset, in whole or\nin part, such diminution in value.\n\n. An option on a swap agreement, or a\n\u0093swaption,\u0094 is a contract that gives a\ncounterparty the right (but not the\nobligation)\nto enter into a new swap agreement or to\nshorten, extend, cancel or otherwise modify an\nexisting swap agreement, at some designated\nfuture time on specified terms. In return, the\npurchaser pays a \u0093premium\u0094 to the seller of\nthe contract.\nThe seller of the contract receives the\npremium and bears the risk of unfavorable\nchanges on the underlying swap. The Fund may\nwrite (sell) and purchase put and call\nswaptions. The Fund may also enter into\nswaptions on either an asset-based or\nliability-based basis, depending on whether\nthe Fund is hedging its assets or its\nliabilities. The Fund may write (sell) and\npurchase put and call swaptions to the same\nextent it may make use of standard options on\nsecurities or other instruments.\nThe Fund may enter into these transactions\nprimarily to preserve a return or spread on a\nparticular investment or portion of its\nholdings, as a duration management technique,\nto protect against an increase in the price of\nsecurities the Fund\nanticipates purchasing at a later date, or for\nany other purposes, such as for speculation to\nincrease returns. Swaptions are generally\nsubject to the same risks involved in the\nFund\u0092s use of options.\n\nDepending on the terms of the particular\noption agreement, the Fund will generally\nincur a greater degree of risk when it writes\na swaption than it will incur\nwhen it purchases a swaption. When the Fund\npurchases a swaption, it risks losing only the\namount of the premium it has paid should it\ndecide to let the option expire unexercised.\nHowever, when the Fund writes a swaption, upon\nexercise of the option\nthe Fund will become obligated according to\nthe terms of the underlying agreement.\n\nCertain additional risk factors related to\nderivatives are discussed\nbelow:\n\n. Under recently adopted rules by the CFTC,\ntransactions in some types of interest rate\nswaps and index credit default\nswaps on North American and European indices\nare required to be cleared. In addition, the\nCFTC may promulgate additional regulations\nthat require clearing of other classes of\nswaps. In a cleared derivatives transaction\n(which includes commodities\nfutures and cleared swaps transactions), the\nFund\u0092s counterparty is a clearing house (such\nas CME, ICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet),\nrather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund\nis not a member of a clearing house and only\nmembers of a\nclearing house can participate\n\n8\n\ndirectly in the clearing house, the Fund holds\ncleared derivatives through accounts at\nclearing members, who are futures commission\nmerchants that are members of the clearing\nhouses and who have\nthe appropriate regulatory approvals to engage\nin cleared swap transactions. The Fund makes\nand receives payments owed under cleared\nderivatives transactions (including margin\npayments) through its accounts at clearing\nmembers. Clearing members\nguarantee performance of their clients\u0092\nobligations to the clearing house. In contrast\nto bilateral OTC transactions, clearing\nmembers generally can require termination of\nexisting cleared derivatives transactions at\nany time and increases in\nmargin above the margin that it required at\nthe beginning of a transaction. Clearing\nhouses also have broad rights to increase\nmargin requirements for existing transactions\nand to terminate transactions. Any such\nincrease or termination could\ninterfere with the ability of the Fund to\npursue its investment strategy. Also, the Fund\nis subject to execution risk if it enters into\na derivatives transaction that is required to\nbe cleared (or that the Advisor expects to be\ncleared), and no\nclearing member is willing or able to clear\nthe transaction on the Fund\u0092s behalf. While\nthe documentation in place between the Fund\nand its clearing members generally provides\nthat the clearing members will accept for\nclearing all transactions\nsubmitted for clearing that are within credit\nlimits specified by the clearing members in\nadvance, the Fund could be subject to this\nexecution risk if the Fund submits for\nclearing transactions that exceed such credit\nlimits, if the clearing house\ndoes not accept the transactions for clearing,\nor if the clearing members do not comply with\ntheir agreement to clear such transactions. In\nthat case, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of\nany increase in the value of the transaction\nafter the time of the transaction. In\naddition, new regulations could, among other\nthings, restrict the Fund\u0092s ability to engage\nin, or increase the cost to the Fund of,\nderivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund or increasing\nmargin or capital requirements. If the Fund is\nnot able to enter into a particular\nderivatives transaction, the Fund\u0092s investment\nperformance and risk\nprofile could be adversely affected as a\nresult.\n\n. Counterparty risk with respect to OTC\nderivatives may be affected by new\nregulations promulgated by the CFTC and SEC\naffecting the derivatives market. As described\nunder \u0093Derivatives Risk\u0094 above, some\nderivatives transactions are required to be\ncleared, and a party to a cleared derivatives\ntransaction is\nsubject to the credit risk of the clearing\nhouse and the clearing member through which it\nholds its cleared derivatives position, rather\nthan the credit risk of its original\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction.\nClearing members are required\nto segregate all funds received from customers\nwith respect to cleared derivatives\ntransactions from the clearing member\u0092s\nproprietary assets. However, all funds and\nother property received by a clearing broker\nfrom its customers are generally\nheld by the clearing broker on a commingled\nbasis in an omnibus account, which may also\ninvest those funds in certain instruments\npermitted under the applicable regulations.\nAlso, the clearing member transfers to the\nclearing house the amount of\nmargin required by the clearing house for\ncleared derivatives transactions, which\namounts are generally held in the relevant\nomnibus account at the clearing house for all\ncustomers of the clearing member.\n\nFor commodities futures positions, the\nclearing house may use all of the collateral\nheld in the clearing member\u0092s omnibus account\nto meet a loss in that\naccount, without regard to which customer in\nfact supplied that collateral. Accordingly, in\naddition to bearing the credit risk of its\nclearing member, each customer to a futures\ntransaction also bears \u0093fellow customer\u0094 risk\nfrom other\ncustomers of the clearing member. However,\nwith respect to cleared swaps positions,\nrecent regulations promulgated by the CFTC\nrequire that the clearing member notify the\nclearing house of the amount of initial margin\nprovided by the clearing member\nto the clearing house that is attributable to\neach customer. Because margin in respect of\ncleared swaps must be earmarked for specific\nclearing member customers, the clearing house\nmay not use the collateral of one customer to\ncover the obligations\nof another customer. However, if the clearing\nmember does not provide accurate reporting,\nthe Fund is subject to the risk that a\nclearing house will use the Fund\u0092s assets held\nin an omnibus account at the clearing house to\nsatisfy payment\nobligations of a defaulting customer of the\nclearing member to the clearing house. In\naddition, clearing members may generally\nchoose to provide to the clearing house the\nnet amount of variation margin required for\ncleared swaps for all of its\ncustomers in the aggregate, rather than the\ngross amount for each customer.\n\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nThe Fund may take advantage of opportunities\nin the area of options and futures contracts,\noptions on futures contracts, warrants, swaps\nand any other\ninvestments which are not presently\ncontemplated for use by the Fund or which are\nnot currently available but which may be\ndeveloped, to the extent such opportunities\nare both consistent with the Fund\u0092s investment\nobjective and legally\npermissible for the Fund. Before entering into\nsuch transactions or making any such\ninvestment, the Fund will provide appropriate\ndisclosure.\n\nHIGH YIELD\nSECURITIES\n\nInvestment in high yield securities generally\nprovides greater income and increased\nopportunity for capital appreciation than\ninvestments in\nhigher quality securities, but they also\ntypically entail greater price volatility and\ncredit risk. These high yield securities are\nregarded as predominantly speculative with\nrespect to the issuer\u0092s continuing ability to\nmeet principal and\ninterest payments. Analysis of the\ncreditworthiness of issuers of debt securities\nthat are high yield may be more complex than\nfor issuers of higher quality debt securities.\nIn addition, high yield securities are often\nissued by smaller, less\ncreditworthy companies or by highly leveraged\n(indebted) firms, but can also be issued by\ngovernments. Such issuers are generally less\nable than more financially stable issuers to\nmake scheduled payments of interest and\nprincipal. The risks posed by\nsecurities issued under such circumstances are\nsubstantial.\n\n9\n\nInvesting in high yield debt securities\ninvolves risks that are greater than the risks\nof investing in higher\nquality debt securities. These risks include:\n(i) changes in credit status, including weaker\noverall credit conditions of issuers and risks\nof default; (ii) industry, market and economic\nrisk; and (iii) greater price variability and\ncredit risks of certain high yield securities\nsuch as zero coupon and payment-in-kind\nsecurities. While these risks provide the\nopportunity for maximizing return over\ntime, they may result in greater volatility of\nthe value of the Fund than a fund that invests\nin higher-rated securities.\n\nFurthermore, the value of high\nyield securities may be more susceptible to\nreal or perceived adverse economic, company or\nindustry conditions than is the case for\nhigher quality securities. The market values\nof certain of these lower-rated and unrated\ndebt securities tend to\nreflect individual issuer developments to a\ngreater extent than do higher-rated securities\nwhich react primarily to fluctuations in the\ngeneral level of interest rates, and tend to\nbe more sensitive to economic conditions than\nare higher-rated\nsecurities. Adverse market, credit or economic\nconditions could make it difficult at certain\ntimes to sell certain high yield securities\nheld by the Fund.\n\nThe secondary market on which high yield\nsecurities are traded may be less liquid than\nthe market for higher grade securities. Less\nliquidity in the secondary\ntrading market could adversely affect the\nprice at which the Fund could sell a high\nyield security, and could adversely affect the\ndaily net asset value per share of the Fund.\nWhen secondary markets for high yield\nsecurities are less liquid than the\nmarket for higher grade securities, it may be\nmore difficult to value the securities because\nthere is less reliable, objective data\navailable. However, the Index seeks to include\nprimarily high yield securities that the Index\nprovider believes have\ngreater liquidity than the broader high yield\nsecurities market as a whole.\n\nThe use of credit ratings as a principal\nmethod of selecting high yield\nsecurities can involve certain risks. For\nexample, credit ratings evaluate the safety of\nprincipal and interest payments, not the\nmarket value risk of high yield securities.\nAlso, credit rating agencies may fail to\nchange credit ratings in a timely\nfashion to reflect events since the security\nwas last rated.\n\nILLIQUID SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in illiquid securities.\nThe Fund may not acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after the\nacquisition, the Fund would have\ninvested more than 15% of its net assets in\nilliquid securities. An illiquid security\nmeans any security that the Fund reasonably\nexpects cannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in seven calendar\ndays or less without the sale or\ndisposition significantly changing the market\nvalue of the investment. If illiquid\nsecurities exceed 15% of the Fund\u0092s net\nassets, certain remedial actions will be taken\nas required by Rule 22e-4 under\nthe 1940 Act and the Fund\u0092s policies and\nprocedures.\n\nINVESTMENT COMPANIES\n\nThe Fund may invest in the securities of other\ninvestment companies, including affiliated\nfunds and money market funds, subject to\napplicable limitations under\nSection 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to\nSection 12(d)(1), the Fund may invest in the\nsecurities of another investment company (the\n\u0093acquired company\u0094) provided that the Fund,\nimmediately after such purchase or\nacquisition,\ndoes not own in the aggregate: (i) more than\n3% of the total outstanding voting stock of\nthe acquired company; (ii) securities issued\nby the acquired company having an aggregate\nvalue in excess of 5% of the value of the\ntotal assets of the\nFund; or (iii) securities issued by the\nacquired company and all other investment\ncompanies (other than Treasury stock of the\nFund) having an aggregate value in excess of\n10% of the value of the total assets of the\nFund. To the extent allowed\nby law, regulation, the Fund\u0092s investment\nrestrictions and the Trust\u0092s exemptive relief,\nthe Fund may invest its assets in securities\nof investment companies that are affiliated\nfunds and/or money market funds in excess of\nthe limits\ndiscussed above.\n\nIf the Fund invests in and, thus, is a\nshareholder of, another investment company,\nthe Fund\u0092s shareholders will indirectly bear\nthe\nFund\u0092s proportionate share of the fees and\nexpenses paid by such other investment\ncompany, including advisory fees, in addition\nto both the management fees payable directly\nby the Fund to the Fund\u0092s own investment\nadviser and the other\nexpenses that the Fund bears directly in\nconnection with the Fund\u0092s own operations.\n\nLENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may lend portfolio securities to\ncertain creditworthy borrowers in U.S. and\nnon-U.S. markets in an amount not\nto exceed 40% of the value of its net assets.\nThe borrowers provide collateral that is\nmarked to market daily in an amount at least\nequal to the current market value of the\nsecurities loaned. The Fund may terminate a\nloan at any time and obtain\nthe securities loaned. The Fund receives the\nvalue of any interest or cash or non-cash\ndistributions paid on the loaned securities.\nThe Fund cannot vote proxies for securities on\nloan, but may recall loans to\nvote proxies if a material issue affecting the\nFund\u0092s economic interest in the investment is\nto be voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities, and\nmay involve expenses to the Fund.\nDistributions received on loaned securities in\nlieu of dividend payments (i.e., substitute\npayments) would not be considered qualified\ndividend income.\n\n10\n\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized\nby cash, the borrower will be entitled to\nreceive a fee based on\nthe amount of cash collateral. The Fund is\ncompensated by the difference between the\namount earned on the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral and the fee paid to the borrower.\nIn the case of collateral other than cash, the\nFund is compensated by a fee\npaid by the borrower equal to a percentage of\nthe market value of the loaned securities. Any\ncash collateral may be reinvested in certain\nhigh quality short-term instruments either\ndirectly on behalf of the Fund or through one\nor more joint accounts\nor funds, which may include those managed by\nthe Adviser. The Fund could lose money due to\na decline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or any investments made\nwith cash collateral. Certain\nnon-cash collateral or investments made with\ncash collateral may have a greater risk of\nloss than other non-cash collateral or\ninvestments.\n\nThe Fund may pay a portion of the interest or\nfees earned from securities lending to a\nborrower as described above, and to one or\nmore securities lending\nagents approved by the Board of Trustees of\nthe Trust (the \u0093Board\u0094) who administer the\nlending program for the Fund in accordance\nwith guidelines approved by the Board. In such\ncapacity, the lending agent provides the\nfollowing services to\nthe Fund in connection with the Fund\u0092s\nsecurities lending activities: (i) locating\nborrowers among an approved list of\nprospective borrowers; (ii) causing the\ndelivery of loaned securities from the Fund to\nborrowers;\n(iii) monitoring the value of loaned\nsecurities, the value of collateral received,\nand other lending parameters; (iv) seeking\nadditional collateral, as necessary, from\nborrowers; (v) receiving and holding\ncollateral from borrowers,\nand facilitating the investment and\nreinvestment of all or substantially all cash\ncollateral in an investment vehicle designated\nby the Fund; (vi) returning collateral to\nborrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute\ndividend, interest, and\nother distribution payments to the Fund from\nborrowers; (viii) negotiating the terms of\neach loan of securities, including but not\nlimited to the amount of any loan premium, and\nmonitoring the terms of securities loan\nagreements with\nprospective borrowers for consistency with the\nrequirements of the Fund\u0092s Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement; (ix) selecting\nsecurities, including amounts (percentages),\nto be loaned; (x) recordkeeping and accounting\nservicing; and (xi) arranging for return of\nloaned securities to the Fund in accordance\nwith the terms of the Securities Lending\nAuthorization Agreement. State Street Bank and\nTrust Company (\u0093State Street\u0094), an affiliate\nof the Trust,\nhas been approved by the Board to serve as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund and the\nTrust has entered into an agreement with State\nStreet for such services. Among other matters,\nthe Trust has agreed to indemnify State Street\nfor certain\nliabilities. State Street has received an\norder of exemption from the SEC under Sections\n17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the 1940 Act to serve\nas the lending agent for affiliated investment\ncompanies such as the Trust and to invest the\ncash collateral\nreceived from loan transactions to be invested\nin an affiliated cash collateral fund.\n\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including\noperational risk (i.e., the risk of losses\nresulting from problems in the settlement and\naccounting process especially so in certain\ninternational markets such as Taiwan), \u0093gap\u0094\nrisk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the\nreturn on cash\ncollateral reinvestments and the fees the Fund\nhas agreed to pay a borrower), risk of loss of\ncollateral, credit, legal, counterparty and\nmarket risk. If a securities lending\ncounterparty were to default, the Fund would\nbe subject to the risk of a\npossible delay in receiving collateral or in\nrecovering the loaned securities, or to a\npossible loss of rights in the collateral. In\nthe event a borrower does not return the\nFund\u0092s securities as agreed, the Fund may\nexperience losses if the\nproceeds received from liquidating the\ncollateral do not at least equal the value of\nthe loaned security at the time the collateral\nis liquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nAlthough State Street has\nagreed to provide the Fund with\nindemnification in the event of a borrower\ndefault, the Fund is still exposed to the risk\nof losses in the event a borrower does not\nreturn the Fund\u0092s securities as agreed. For\nexample, delays in recovery of lent\nsecurities may cause the Fund to lose the\nopportunity to sell the securities at a\ndesirable price.\n\nLEVERAGING\n\nWhile the Fund does not anticipate doing so,\nthe Fund may borrow money in an amount greater\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund\u0092s total\nassets. However,\nunder normal circumstances, the Fund will not\nborrow money from a bank in an amount greater\nthan 10% of the value of the Fund\u0092s total\nassets. Borrowing for investment purposes is\none form of leverage. Leveraging investments,\nby purchasing\nsecurities with borrowed money, is a\nspeculative technique that increases\ninvestment risk, but also increases investment\nopportunity. Because substantially all of the\nFund\u0092s assets will fluctuate in value, whereas\nthe interest obligations\non borrowings may be fixed, the NAV of the\nFund will increase more when the Fund\u0092s\nportfolio assets increase in value and\ndecrease more when the Fund\u0092s portfolio assets\ndecrease in value than would otherwise be the\ncase. Moreover,\ninterest costs on borrowings may fluctuate\nwith changing market rates of interest and may\npartially offset or exceed the returns on the\nborrowed funds.\n\nOTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in short-term\ninstruments, including money market\ninstruments, (including money market funds\nadvised by the Adviser), cash and cash\nequivalents, on an ongoing basis to provide\nliquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term\ninvestments that may include but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by the Adviser); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit (\u0093CDs\u0094),\nbankers\u0092 acceptances, fixed time deposits and\nother obligations of U.S. and foreign banks\n(including foreign branches) and similar\ninstitutions;\n(iv) commercial paper rated at the date of\npurchase \u0093Prime-1\u0094 by Moody\u0092s Investors\nService (\u0093Moody\u0092s\u0094) or \u0093A-1\u0094 by\nStandard & Poor\u0092s (\u0093S&P\u0094), or if unrated, of\ncomparable quality as determined by the\nAdviser; (v) non-convertible corporate debt\nsecurities (e.g., bonds and debentures)\nwith remaining maturities at the date of\npurchase of not more than 397 days and that\npresent minimal credit risks; and (vi) short-\nterm U.S. dollar-denominated\n\n11\n\nobligations of foreign banks (including U.S.\nbranches) that, in the opinion of the Adviser,\nare of comparable quality to obligations of\nU.S. banks which may be purchased by the Fund.\nAny of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or a\nforward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-\nnegotiable deposits maintained in banking\ninstitutions for specified periods of time at\nstated interest rates.\nBankers\u0092 acceptances are time drafts drawn on\ncommercial banks by borrowers, usually in\nconnection with international transactions.\nMoney market instruments also include shares\nof money market funds. The SEC and other\ngovernment agencies\ncontinue to review the regulation of money\nmarket funds. The SEC has adopted changes to\nthe rules that govern money market funds, and\ncompliance with many of these amendments was\nrequired in October 2016. Legislative\ndevelopments may also affect\nmoney market funds. These changes and\ndevelopments may affect the investment\nstrategies, performance, yield, operating\nexpenses and continued viability of a money\nmarket fund.\n\nPRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND RESTRICTED SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may\ninvest in securities that are purchased in\nprivate placements and, accordingly, are\nsubject to restrictions on resale as a matter\nof contract or under federal securities laws.\nWhile such private placements may offer\nattractive opportunities for\ninvestment not otherwise available on the open\nmarket, the securities so purchased are often\n\u0093restricted securities,\u0094 i.e., securities\nwhich cannot be sold to the public without\nregistration under the Securities Act or the\navailability of\nan exemption from registration (such as Rules\n144 or 144A), or which are not readily\nmarketable because they are subject to other\nlegal or contractual delays in or restrictions\non resale. Generally speaking, restricted\nsecurities may be sold only to\nqualified institutional buyers, or in a\nprivately negotiated transaction to a limited\nnumber of purchasers, or in limited quantities\nafter they have been held for a specified\nperiod of time and other conditions are met\npursuant to an exemption from\nregistration, or in a public offering for\nwhich a registration statement is in effect\nunder the Securities Act.\n\nBecause there may be relatively few\npotential purchasers for such investments,\nespecially under adverse market or economic\nconditions or in the event of adverse changes\nin the financial condition of the issuer, the\nFund could find it more difficult to sell such\nsecurities when the\nAdviser believes it advisable to do so or may\nbe able to sell such securities only at prices\nlower than if such securities were more widely\nheld. Market quotations for such securities\nare generally less readily available than for\npublicly traded\nsecurities. The absence of a trading market\ncan make it difficult to ascertain a market\nvalue for such securities for purposes of\ncomputing the Fund\u0092s net asset value, and the\njudgment of the Adviser may at times play a\ngreater role in valuing\nthese securities than in the case of publicly\ntraded securities. Disposing of such\nsecurities, which may be illiquid investments,\ncan involve time-consuming negotiation and\nlegal expenses, and it may be difficult or\nimpossible for the Fund to sell\nthem promptly at an acceptable price. The Fund\nmay have to bear the extra expense of\nregistering such securities for resale and the\nrisk of substantial delay in effecting such\nregistration.\n\nThe Fund may be deemed to be an \u0093underwriter\u0094\nfor purposes of the Securities Act when\nselling restricted securities to the public,\nand in such event\nthe Fund may be liable to purchasers of such\nsecurities if the registration statement\nprepared by the issuer, or the prospectus\nforming a part of it, is materially inaccurate\nor misleading.\n\nRATINGS\n\nAn investment-grade rating means the security\nor issuer\nis rated investment-grade by Moody\u0092s, S&P,\nFitch, Inc. (\u0093Fitch\u0094), Dominion Bond Rating\nService Limited, or another credit rating\nagency designated as a nationally recognized\nstatistical rating organization by the SEC, or\nis\nunrated but considered to be of equivalent\nquality by the Adviser.\n\nSubsequent to purchase by the Fund, a rated\nsecurity may cease to be rated or its\ninvestment-grade rating may be reduced below\nan investment-grade rating. Bonds rated lower\nthan Baa3 by Moody\u0092s or BBB- by S&P or Fitch\nare below investment-grade quality and are\nobligations of\nissuers that are considered predominantly\nspeculative with respect to the issuer\u0092s\ncapacity to pay interest and repay principal\naccording to the terms of the obligation and,\ntherefore, carry greater investment risk,\nincluding the possibility of\nissuer default and bankruptcy and increased\nmarket price volatility. Such securities\n(\u0093lower rated securities\u0094) are commonly\nreferred to as \u0093junk bonds\u0094 and are subject to\na substantial degree of credit risk. Lower\nrated\nsecurities are often issued by smaller, less\ncreditworthy companies or by highly leveraged\n(indebted) firms, which are generally less\nable than more financially stable firms to\nmake scheduled payments of interest and\nprincipal. The risks posed by\nsecurities issued under such circumstances are\nsubstantial. Bonds rated below investment-\ngrade tend to be less marketable than higher-\nquality bonds because the market for them is\nless broad. The market for unrated bonds is\neven narrower. See\n\u0093HIGH YIELD SECURITIES\u0094 above for more\ninformation relating to the risks associated\nwith investing in lower rated securities, or\nAppendix C for more information on the ratings\nof debt instruments.\n\nREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may invest in repurchase\nagreements with commercial banks, brokers or\ndealers to generate income from its excess\ncash balances and to invest securities lending\ncash collateral. A repurchase agreement is an\nagreement under which the Fund acquires a\nfinancial instrument\n(e.g., a security issued by the U.S.\ngovernment or an agency thereof, a banker\u0092s\nacceptance or a certificate of deposit) from a\nseller, subject to resale to the seller at an\nagreed upon price and date (normally, the next\nBusiness Day\n\u0096 as defined below). A repurchase agreement\nmay be considered a loan collateralized by\nsecurities. The resale price reflects an\nagreed upon interest rate effective for the\nperiod the instrument is held by the Fund and\nis unrelated to the\ninterest rate on the underlying instrument.\n\n12\n\nIn these repurchase agreement transactions,\nthe securities acquired by the Fund (including\naccrued interest\nearned thereon) must have a total value in\nexcess of the value of the repurchase\nagreement and are held by the Custodian until\nrepurchased. No more than an aggregate of 15%\nof the Fund\u0092s net assets will be invested in\nilliquid securities,\nincluding repurchase agreements having\nmaturities longer than seven days and\nsecurities subject to legal or contractual\nrestrictions on resale, or for which there are\nno readily available market quotations.\n\nThe use of repurchase agreements involves\ncertain risks. For example, if the other party\nto the agreement defaults on its obligation to\nrepurchase the\nunderlying security at a time when the value\nof the security has declined, the Fund may\nincur a loss upon disposition of the security.\nIf the other party to the agreement becomes\ninsolvent and subject to liquidation or\nreorganization under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or other laws, a court may\ndetermine that the underlying security is\ncollateral for a loan by the Fund not within\nthe control of the Fund and, therefore, the\nFund may not be able to substantiate its\ninterest in the underlying\nsecurity and may be deemed an unsecured\ncreditor of the other party to the agreement.\n\nREVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Fund may enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements, which involve the sale of\nsecurities with an agreement to repurchase the\nsecurities at an agreed-upon\nprice, date and interest payment and have the\ncharacteristics of borrowing. The securities\npurchased with the funds obtained from the\nagreement and securities collateralizing the\nagreement will have maturity dates no later\nthan the repayment date.\nGenerally the effect of such transactions is\nthat the Fund can recover all or most of the\ncash invested in the portfolio securities\ninvolved during the term of the reverse\nrepurchase agreement, while in many cases the\nFund is able to keep some of\nthe interest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are only\nadvantageous if the Fund has an opportunity to\nearn a greater rate of interest on the cash\nderived from these transactions than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same\namount of cash. Opportunities to realize\nearnings from the use of the proceeds equal to\nor greater than the interest required to be\npaid may not always be available and the Fund\nintends to use the reverse repurchase\ntechnique only when the Adviser\nbelieves it will be advantageous to the Fund.\nThe use of reverse repurchase agreements may\nexaggerate any interim increase or decrease in\nthe value of the Fund\u0092s assets. The Fund\u0092s\nexposure to reverse repurchase agreements will\nbe covered\nby securities having a value equal to or\ngreater than such commitments. Under the 1940\nAct, reverse repurchase agreements are\nconsidered borrowings. Although there is no\npercentage limit on Fund assets that can be\nused in connection with reverse\nrepurchase agreements, the Fund does not\nexpect to engage, under normal circumstances,\nin reverse repurchase agreements with respect\nto more than 10% of its total assets.\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nU.S. Government obligations are a\ntype of bond. U.S. Government obligations\ninclude securities issued or guaranteed as to\nprincipal and interest by the U.S. Government,\nits agencies or instrumentalities.\n\nOne type of U.S. Government obligation, U.S.\nTreasury obligations, are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. Treasury and\ndiffer only in their\ninterest rates, maturities, and times of\nissuance. U.S. Treasury bills have initial\nmaturities of one-year or less; U.S. Treasury\nnotes have initial maturities of one to ten\nyears; and U.S. Treasury bonds\ngenerally have initial maturities of greater\nthan ten years.\n\nOther U.S. Government obligations are issued\nor guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities\nof the U.S. Government including, but not\nlimited to, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u0093Fannie Mae\u0094), the Government\nNational Mortgage Association (\u0093Ginnie Mae\u0094),\nthe Small Business Administration, the Federal\nFarm Credit\nAdministration, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage\nCorporation (\u0093Freddie Mac\u0094), the Federal Home\nLoan Banks (\u0093FHLB\u0094), Banks for Cooperatives\n(including the Central Bank for Cooperatives),\nthe Federal Land Banks, the Federal\nIntermediate Credit Banks, the Tennessee\nValley Authority, the Export-Import Bank of\nthe United States, the Commodity Credit\nCorporation, the Federal Financing Bank, the\nStudent Loan Marketing Association, the\nNational Credit Union Administration\nand the Federal Agricultural Mortgage\nCorporation (Farmer Mac). Some obligations\nissued or guaranteed by U.S. Government\nagencies and instrumentalities, including, for\nexample, Ginnie Mae pass-through certificates,\nare supported by the full faith\nand credit of the U.S. Treasury. Other\nobligations issued by or guaranteed by federal\nagencies, such as those securities issued by\nFannie Mae, are supported by the discretionary\nauthority of the U.S. Government to purchase\ncertain obligations of the\nfederal agency, while other obligations issued\nby or guaranteed by federal agencies, such as\nthose of the Federal Home Loan Banks, are\nsupported by the right of the issuer to borrow\nfrom the U.S. Treasury. While the U.S.\nGovernment provides\nfinancial support to such U.S. Government-\nsponsored federal agencies, no assurance can\nbe given that the U.S. Government will always\ndo so, since the U.S. Government is not so\nobligated by law.\n\n13\n\nIn September 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced\na federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac, placing the two\nfederal instrumentalities in conservatorship.\nUnder the terms of the takeover, the U.S.\nTreasury agreed to acquire $1 billion of\nsenior preferred stock of each instrumentality\nand obtained warrants for the purchase of\ncommon stock of each\ninstrumentality. Under these Senior Preferred\nStock Purchase Agreements (\u0093SPAs\u0094), the U.S.\nTreasury has pledged to provide a limited\namount of capital per instrumentality as\nneeded, including the contribution of cash\ncapital to the\ninstrumentalities in the event their\nliabilities exceed their assets. In May 2009,\nthe U.S. Treasury increased its maximum\ncommitment to each instrumentality under the\nSPAs from $100 billion to $200 billion per\ninstrumentality. In December\n2009, the U.S. Treasury amended the SPAs to\nprovide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with some\nadditional flexibility to meet the requirement\nto reduce their mortgage portfolios. Also in\nDecember 2009, the U.S. Treasury further\namended the SPAs to allow\nthe cap on the U.S. Treasury\u0092s funding\ncommitment to increase as necessary to\naccommodate any cumulative reduction in Fannie\nMae\u0092s and Freddie Mac\u0092s net worth through the\nend of 2012. On August 17, 2012, the U.S.\nTreasury\nannounced that it was again amending the SPAs\nto terminate the requirement that Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac each pay a 10% dividend\nannually on all amounts received under the\nfunding commitment. Instead, they were\nrequired to transfer to the U.S.\nTreasury on a quarterly basis all profits\nearned during a quarter that exceeded a\ncapital reserve amount of $3 billion. On\nSeptember 30, 2019, the U.S. Treasury\nannounced amendments to the SPAs permitting\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac to\nmaintain capital reserves of $25 billion and\n$20 billion, respectively. It is believed that\nthe amendment puts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nin a better position to service their debt\nbecause the companies no longer have to borrow\nfrom the\nU.S. Treasury to make fixed dividend payments.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the subject of\nseveral continuing class action lawsuits and\ninvestigations\nby federal regulators over certain accounting,\ndisclosure or corporate governance matters,\nwhich (along with any resulting financial\nrestatements) may adversely affect the\nguaranteeing entities. Importantly, the future\nof the entities is in serious\nquestion as the U.S. government reportedly is\nconsidering multiple options, ranging from\nnationalization, privatization, consolidation,\nor abolishment of the entities.\n\nU.S. REGISTERED SECURITIES OF FOREIGN ISSUERS\n\nInvesting in U.S.\nregistered, dollar-denominated, securities\nissued by non-U.S. issuers involves some risks\nand considerations not typically associated\nwith investing in U.S. companies. These\ninclude differences in accounting,\nauditing and financial reporting standards,\nthe possibility of expropriation or\nconfiscatory taxation, adverse changes in\ninvestment or exchange control regulations,\npolitical instability which could affect U.S.\ninvestments in foreign countries, and\npotential restrictions of the flow of\ninternational capital. Foreign companies may\nbe subject to less governmental regulation\nthan U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual\nforeign economies may differ favorably or\nunfavorably from the U.S. economy in such\nrespects as growth of gross domestic product,\nrate of inflation, capital reinvestment,\nresource self-sufficiency and balance of\npayment positions.\n\nVARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES\n\nVariable rate securities\nare instruments issued or guaranteed by\nentities such as (1) US Government, or an\nagency or instrumentality thereof, (2) states,\nmunicipalities and other political\nsubdivisions, agencies, authorities and\ninstrumentalities or states and\nmulti-state agencies or authorities (3)\ncorporations, (4) financial institutions, (5)\ninsurance companies or (6) trusts that have a\nrate of interest subject to adjustment at\nregular intervals but less frequently than\nannually. A\nvariable rate security provides for the\nautomatic establishment of a new interest rate\non set dates. Variable rate obligations whose\ninterest is readjusted no less frequently than\nannually will be deemed to have a maturity\nequal to the period\nremaining until the next readjustment of the\ninterest rate. The Fund may also purchase\nfloating rate securities. A floating rate\nsecurity provides for the automatic adjustment\nof its interest rate whenever a specified\ninterest rate changes. Interest\nrates on these securities are ordinarily tied\nto, and are a percentage of, a widely\nrecognized interest rate, such as the yield on\n90-day US Treasury bills or the prime rate of\na specified bank. These rates\nmay change as often as twice daily. Generally,\nchanges in interest rates will have a smaller\neffect on the market value of variable and\nfixed rate floating rate securities than on\nthe market value of comparable fixed rate\nfixed income obligations.\nThus, investing in variable and fixed rate\nfloating rate securities generally allows less\nopportunity for capital appreciation and\ndepreciation than investing in comparable\nfixed rate fixed income securities.\n\nWHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES\n\nThe Fund may purchase securities on a\nwhen-issued basis. Delivery of and payment for\nthese securities may take place as long as a\nmonth or more after the date of the purchase\ncommitment. The value of these securities is\nsubject to market fluctuation during this\nperiod, and no income\naccrues to the Fund until settlement takes\nplace. When entering into a when-issued\ntransaction, the Fund will rely on the other\nparty to consummate the transaction; if the\nother party fails to do so, the Fund may be\ndisadvantaged.\n\nSecurities purchased on a when-issued basis\nand held by the Fund are subject to changes in\nmarket value based upon actual or perceived\nchanges in the level of\ninterest rates. Generally, the value of such\nsecurities will fluctuate inversely to changes\nin interest rates \u0097 i.e., they will appreciate\nin value when interest rates decline and\ndecrease in value when interest rates rise.\nTherefore, if\nin order to achieve higher interest income the\nFund remains substantially fully invested at\nthe same time that it has purchased securities\non a \u0093when-issued\u0094 basis, there will be a\ngreater possibility of fluctuation in the\nFund\u0092s NAV.\n\n14\n\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS\n\nA discussion of the risks associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus. The discussion below supplements,\nand should be read in\nconjunction with, the Prospectus.\n\nGENERAL\n\nInvestment in\nthe Fund should be made with an understanding\nthat the value of the Fund\u0092s portfolio\nsecurities may fluctuate in accordance with\nchanges in the financial condition of the\nissuers of the portfolio securities, the value\nof securities generally\nand other factors.\n\nAn investment in the Fund should also be made\nwith an understanding of the risks inherent in\nan investment in securities, including\nthe risk that the financial condition of\nissuers may become impaired or that the\ngeneral condition of the securities markets\nmay deteriorate (either of which may cause a\ndecrease in the value of the portfolio\nsecurities and thus in the value of\nShares). Securities are susceptible to general\nmarket fluctuations and to volatile increases\nand decreases in value as market confidence in\nand perceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable\nfactors including expectations regarding\ngovernment, economic, monetary and fiscal\npolicies, inflation and interest rates,\neconomic expansion or contraction, and global\nor regional political, economic and banking\ncrises. Securities of issuers traded\non exchanges may be suspended on certain\nexchanges by the issuers themselves, by an\nexchange or by government authorities. The\nlikelihood of such suspensions may be higher\nfor securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than\nin countries with more developed markets.\nTrading suspensions may be applied from time\nto time to the securities of individual\nissuers for reasons specific to that issuer,\nor may be applied broadly by exchanges or\ngovernmental authorities in\nresponse to market events. Suspensions may\nlast for significant periods of time, during\nwhich trading in the securities and\ninstruments that reference the securities,\nsuch as participatory notes (or\n\u0093P-notes\u0094) or other derivative instruments,\nmay be halted.\n\nHolders of common stock incur more risk than\nholders of preferred stocks and debt\nobligations because common stockholders, as\nowners of the issuer, have generally inferior\nrights to receive payments from the issuer in\ncomparison with the rights of creditors of, or\nholders of debt obligations\nor preferred stocks issued by, the issuer.\nFurther, unlike debt securities which\ntypically have a stated principal amount\npayable at maturity (whose value, however,\nwill be subject to market fluctuations prior\nthereto), or preferred stocks which\ntypically have a liquidation preference and\nwhich may have stated optional or mandatory\nredemption provisions, common stock have\nneither a fixed principal amount nor a\nmaturity. Common stock values are subject to\nmarket fluctuations as long as the\ncommon stock remains outstanding.\n\nThe principal trading market for some of the\nsecurities in the Index may be in the over-\nthe-counter market. The existence of a liquid\ntrading market for certain securities may\ndepend on whether dealers will make a market\nin such securities. There can be no assurance\nthat a market will be\nmade or maintained or that any such market\nwill be or remain liquid. The price at which\nsecurities may be sold and the value of the\nFund\u0092s Shares will be adversely affected if\ntrading markets for the Fund\u0092s portfolio\nsecurities are limited\nor absent or if bid/ask spreads are wide.\n\nBREXIT RISK\n\nIn\nJune 2016, citizens of the United Kingdom\nvoted in a referendum to leave the EU (known\nas \u0093Brexit\u0094), creating economic and political\nuncertainty in its wake. In March 2017, the\nUnited Kingdom formally notified the European\nCouncil of the\nUnited Kingdom\u0092s intention to withdraw from\nthe EU pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union. This formal notification began\na multi-year period of negotiations regarding\nthe terms of the United Kingdom\u0092s exit from\nthe EU,\nwhich formally concluded on January 31, 2020.\nThe United Kingdom is currently in a\ntransition period where it remains subject to\nEU rules but has no role in the EU lawmaking\nprocess. During this transition period, United\nKingdom and EU\nrepresentatives are negotiating the precise\nterms of their future relationship. The\ntransition period is scheduled to end on\nDecember 31, 2020. The full scope and nature\nof the consequences of the exit are not at\nthis time known and are\nunlikely to be known for a significant period\nof time. It is also unknown whether the United\nKingdom\u0092s exit will increase the likelihood of\nother countries also departing the EU. Any\nexits from the EU, or the possibility of such\nexits, may have\na significant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could\npotentially have an adverse effect on the\nvalue of the Fund\u0092s investments.\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK\n\nAn investment in the Fund may be subject to a\nnumber of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest. For example, the Adviser or its\naffiliates may provide\nservices to the Fund, such as securities\nlending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting\nservices, transfer agency and shareholder\nservicing, securities brokerage services, and\nother services for which the Fund would\ncompensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates.\nThe Fund may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed,\n\n15\n\nor otherwise affiliated with the Adviser.\nThere is no assurance that the rates at which\nthe Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser\nor its affiliates, or the terms on which it\nenters into\ntransactions with the Adviser or its\naffiliates, will be the most favorable\navailable in the market generally or as\nfavorable as the rates the Adviser makes\navailable to other clients. Because of its\nfinancial interest, the Adviser may have an\nincentive to enter into transactions or\narrangements on behalf of the Fund with itself\nor its affiliates in circumstances where it\nmight not have done so in the absence of that\ninterest.\n\nCONTINUOUS OFFERING\n\nThe method by which Creation Units of\nShares are created and traded may raise\ncertain issues under applicable securities\nlaws. Because new Creation Units of Shares are\nissued and sold by the Trust on an ongoing\nbasis, at any point a \u0093distribution,\u0094 as such\nterm is used in the\nSecurities Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nwhich could render them\nstatutory underwriters and subject them to the\nprospectus delivery and liability provisions\nof the Securities Act.\n\nFor example, a broker-dealer firm or\nits client may be deemed a statutory\nunderwriter if it takes Creation Units after\nplacing an order with the Distributor, breaks\nthem down into constituent Shares, and sells\nsuch Shares directly to customers, or if it\nchooses to couple the creation\nof a supply of new Shares with an active\nselling effort involving solicitation of\nsecondary market demand for Shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the Securities Act must take\ninto account all the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the activities of\nthe broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case, and the examples mentioned\nabove should not be considered a complete\ndescription of all the activities that could\nlead to a categorization as an\nunderwriter.\n\nBroker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u0093underwriters\u0094 but are\neffecting transactions in Shares, whether or\nnot participating in the distribution of\nShares, are generally required to deliver a\nprospectus. This is because the prospectus\ndelivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the\nSecurities Act is not available in respect of\nsuch transactions as a\nresult of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms\nthat incur a prospectus-delivery obligation\nwith respect to Shares of the Fund are\nreminded that under Securities Act Rule 153, a\nprospectus-delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the\nSecurities Act owed to an exchange member in\nconnection with a sale on the Exchange is\nsatisfied by the fact that the Fund\u0092s\nProspectus is available at the Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism\nprovided in Rule 153 is only\navailable with respect to transactions on an\nexchange.\n\nSSGA or its affiliates (the \u0093Selling\nShareholder\u0094) may purchase Creation Units\nthrough a\nbroker-dealer to \u0093seed\u0094 (in whole or in part)\nthe Fund as it is launched, or may purchase\nshares from broker-dealers or other investors\nthat have previously provided \u0093seed\u0094 for the\nFund when it was launched or otherwise in\nsecondary market transactions, and because the\nSelling Shareholder may be deemed an affiliate\nof the Fund, the Shares are being registered\nto permit the resale of these shares from time\nto time after purchase. The Fund will not\nreceive any of the\nproceeds from the resale by the Selling\nShareholders of these Shares.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder intends to sell all or\na portion of the Shares owned by it\nand offered hereby from time to time directly\nor through one or more broker-dealers, and may\nalso hedge such positions. The Shares may be\nsold on any national securities exchange on\nwhich the Shares may be listed or quoted at\nthe time of sale, in\nthe over-the-counter market or in transactions\nother than on these exchanges or systems at\nfixed prices, at prevailing market prices at\nthe time of the sale, at varying\nprices determined at the time of sale, or at\nnegotiated prices. These sales may be effected\nin transactions, which may involve cross or\nblock transactions.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder may also loan or\npledge Shares to broker-dealers that in turn\nmay sell such Shares, to the extent permitted\nby applicable law. The\nSelling Shareholder may also enter into\noptions or other transactions with broker-\ndealers or other financial institutions or the\ncreation of one or more derivative securities\nwhich require the delivery to such broker-\ndealer or other financial\ninstitution of Shares, which Shares such\nbroker-dealer or other financial institution\nmay resell.\n\nThe Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer\nor agents\nparticipating in the distribution of Shares\nmay be deemed to be \u0093underwriters\u0094 within the\nmeaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act\nin connection with such sales. In such event,\nany commissions paid to any such broker-dealer\nor\nagent and any profit on the resale of the\nShares purchased by them may be deemed to be\nunderwriting commissions or discounts under\nthe Securities Act. The Selling Shareholder\nwho may be deemed an \u0093underwriter\u0094 within the\nmeaning of\nSection 2(11) of the Securities Act will be\nsubject to the applicable prospectus delivery\nrequirements of the Securities Act.\n\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK\n\nCounterparty risk with respect to derivatives\nhas been and may continue to be affected by\nnew rules and regulations affecting the\nderivatives market. Some\nderivatives transactions are required to be\ncentrally cleared, and a party to a cleared\nderivatives transaction is subject to the\ncredit risk of the clearing house and the\nclearing member through which it holds its\ncleared position, rather than the\ncredit risk of its original counterparty to\nthe derivatives transaction. Credit risk of\nmarket participants with respect to\nderivatives that are centrally cleared is\nconcentrated in a few clearing houses, and it\nis not clear how an insolvency\nproceeding of a clearing house would be\nconducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by the\nFund, and what impact an insolvency of a\nclearing house would have on the financial\nsystem more generally.\n\n16\n\nFUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS\n\nThere can be no assurance that a liquid\nsecondary market will exist for any particular\nfutures contract or option at any specific\ntime. Thus, it may not be\npossible to close a futures or options\nposition. In the event of adverse price\nmovements, the Fund would continue to be\nrequired to make daily cash payments to\nmaintain its required margin. In such\nsituations, if the Fund has insufficient cash,\nit\nmay have to sell portfolio securities to meet\ndaily margin requirements at a time when it\nmay be disadvantageous to do so. In addition,\nthe Fund may be required to make delivery of\nthe instruments underlying futures contracts\nit has sold.\n\nThe Fund will minimize the risk that it will\nbe unable to close out a futures or options\ncontract by only entering into futures and\noptions for which there\nappears to be a liquid secondary market.\n\nThe risk of loss in trading futures contracts\nor uncovered call options in some strategies\n(e.g., selling\nuncovered index futures contracts) is\npotentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan\nto use futures and options contracts, when\navailable, in this manner. The risk of a\nfutures position may still be large as\ntraditionally measured due to the low\nmargin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, may utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit its risk exposure to that\nwhich is comparable to what it would have\nincurred through direct investment in\nsecurities.\n\nUtilization of futures transactions by the\nFund involves the risk of imperfect or even\nnegative correlation to its benchmark Index if\nthe index underlying the\nfutures contracts differs from the benchmark\nIndex or if the futures contracts do not track\nthe benchmark Index as expected. There is also\nthe risk of loss by the Fund of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom the Fund has\nan open position in the futures contract or\noption.\n\nCertain financial futures exchanges limit the\namount of fluctuation permitted in futures\ncontract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount that the\nprice of a futures contract may vary either up\nor down from the previous day\u0092s settlement\nprice at the end of a trading session. Once\nthe daily limit\nhas been reached in a particular type of\ncontract, no trades may be made on that day at\na price beyond that limit. The daily limit\ngoverns only price movement during a\nparticular trading day and therefore does not\nlimit potential losses, because the\nlimit may prevent the liquidation of\nunfavorable positions. Futures contract prices\nhave occasionally moved to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions\nand subjecting some futures traders to\nsubstantial losses.\n\nRISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS\n\nSwap agreements are subject to the risk that\nthe swap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, the\nFund will have contractual\nremedies pursuant to the agreements related to\nthe transaction, but such remedies may be\nsubject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws\nwhich could affect the Fund\u0092s rights as a\ncreditor.\n\nThe use of interest-rate and index swaps is a\nhighly specialized activity that involves\ninvestment techniques and risks different from\nthose associated with\nordinary portfolio security transactions. The\nuse of a swap requires an understanding not\nonly of the referenced asset, reference rate\nor index but also of the swap itself, without\nthe benefit of observing the performance of\nthe swap under all\npossible market conditions. These transactions\ngenerally do not involve the delivery of\nsecurities or other underlying assets or\nprincipal.\n\nThe absence\nof a regulated execution facility or contract\nmarket and lack of liquidity for swap\ntransactions has led, in some instances, to\ndifficulties in trading and valuation,\nespecially in the event of market disruptions.\nUnder recently adopted rules and\nregulations, transactions in some types of\nswaps are required to be centrally cleared. In\na cleared derivatives transaction, the Fund\u0092s\ncounterparty to the transaction is a central\nderivatives clearing organization, or clearing\nhouse, rather\nthan a bank or broker. Because the Fund is not\na member of a clearing house, and only members\nof a clearing house can participate directly\nin the clearing house, the Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing\nmembers. In cleared\nderivatives transactions, the Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and\nreceive payments from a clearing house through\nits accounts at clearing members. Clearing\nmembers guarantee performance of their\nclients\u0092 obligations to\nthe clearing house. Centrally cleared\nderivative arrangements may be less favorable\nto the Fund than bilateral (non-cleared)\narrangements. For example, the Fund may be\nrequired to provide greater amounts of\nmargin for cleared derivatives transactions\nthan for bilateral derivatives transactions.\nAlso, in contrast to bilateral derivatives\ntransactions, in some cases following a period\nof notice to the Fund, a clearing member\ngenerally can require\ntermination of existing cleared derivatives\ntransactions at any time or an increase in\nmargin requirements above the margin that the\nclearing member required at the beginning of a\ntransaction. Clearing houses also have broad\nrights to increase\nmargin requirements for existing transactions\nor to terminate transactions at any time. The\nFund is subject to risk if it enters into a\nderivatives transaction that is required to be\ncleared (or\n\n17\n\nwhich SSGA FM expects to be cleared), and no\nclearing member is willing or able to clear\nthe transaction on the Fund\u0092s behalf. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and\nthe Fund could lose some or all of the benefit\nof the transaction, including loss of an\nincrease in the value of the transaction and\nloss of hedging protection. In addition, the\ndocumentation governing the relationship\nbetween the Fund and clearing\nmembers is drafted by the clearing members and\ngenerally is less favorable to the Fund than\ntypical bilateral derivatives documentation.\n\nThese clearing\nrules and other new rules and regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict the Fund\u0092s\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to\nthe Fund of, derivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available\nto the Fund, increasing margin or capital\nrequirements, or otherwise limiting liquidity\nor increasing transaction costs. These\nregulations are new and evolving, so their\npotential impact on the Fund and the financial\nsystem are not yet known.\n\n18\n\nBecause they are two party contracts that may\nbe subject to contractual restrictions on\ntransferability and\ntermination and because they may have terms of\ngreater than seven days, swap agreements may\nbe considered to be illiquid and subject to\nthe Fund\u0092s limitation on investments in\nilliquid securities. To the extent that a swap\nis not liquid, it may\nnot be possible to initiate a transaction or\nliquidate a position at an advantageous time\nor price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Like most other investments, swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nmarket value of the instrument\nwill change in a way detrimental to the Fund\u0092s\ninterest.\n\nIf the Fund uses a swap as a hedge against, or\nas a substitute for, a portfolio investment,\nthe Fund will be exposed to the risk that the\nswap will have or will develop imperfect or no\ncorrelation with the portfolio investment.\nThis could cause substantial losses for the\nFund. While hedging strategies involving swap\ninstruments can reduce\nthe risk of loss, they can also reduce the\nopportunity for gain or even result in losses\nby offsetting favorable price movements in\nother Fund investments. Many swaps are complex\nand often valued subjectively.\n\nLIBOR RISK\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u0092s\nFinancial Conduct Authority, which regulates\nLIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out\nLIBOR by the end of 2021. Various financial\nindustry groups have begun planning for that\ntransition, however, there remains uncertainty\nregarding the future\nutilization of LIBOR and the nature of any\nreplacement rate. The replacement or\nabandonment of, or modification to, LIBOR\ncould have adverse impacts on newly issued\nfinancial instruments and existing financial\ninstruments which reference LIBOR.\nWhile some instruments may contemplate a\nscenario where LIBOR is no longer available by\nproviding for an alternative rate setting\nmethodology, not all instruments may have such\nprovisions and there are significant\nuncertainty regarding the\neffectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies. Abandonment of or modifications\nto LIBOR could lead to significant short-term\nand long-term uncertainty and market\ninstability and the extent to which that may\nimpact the Fund may vary depending\non various factors, which include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) existing fallback or\ntermination provisions in individual contracts\nand (ii) whether, how, and when industry\nparticipants develop and adopt new successor\nreference rates and/or\nfallbacks for both legacy and new instruments.\nIn addition, the transition to a successor\nrate could potentially cause (i) increased\nvolatility or illiquidity in markets for\ninstruments that currently rely on LIBOR, (ii)\na reduction in the\nvalue of certain instruments held by the Fund,\nor (iii) reduced effectiveness of related Fund\ntransactions, such as hedging. It remains\nuncertain how such changes would be\nimplemented and the effects such changes would\nhave on the Fund, issuers\nof instruments in which the Fund invests and\nfinancial markets generally. Instruments in\nwhich the Fund invests may pay interest at\nfloating or adjusting rates based on LIBOR or\nmay be subject to interest caps or floors.\nThere remains uncertainty\nregarding the future utilization of LIBOR and\nthe nature of any replacement rate. The\nunavailability or replacement of LIBOR may\naffect the value, liquidity or return on\ncertain Fund investments and may result in\ncosts incurred in connection with\nclosing out positions and entering into new\ntrades. Any pricing adjustments to the Fund\u0092s\ninvestments resulting from a substitute\nreference rate may also adversely affect the\nFund\u0092s performance and/or NAV. Such successor\nor substitute\nreference rate and any adjustments selected\nmay negatively impact the Fund\u0092s investments,\nperformance or financial condition, and may\nexpose the Fund to additional tax, accounting\nand regulatory risks. Additionally, if LIBOR\nceases to exist,\nthe Fund may need to renegotiate the credit\nagreements extending beyond 2021 with the\nFund\u0092s obligors that utilize LIBOR as a factor\nin determining the interest rate and certain\nof the Fund\u0092s existing credit facilities to\nreplace LIBOR\nwith the new standard that is established. Any\npricing adjustments to the Fund\u0092s investments\nresulting from a substitute reference rate may\nalso adversely affect the Fund\u0092s performance\nand/or NAV. Such successor or substitute\nreference\nrate and any adjustments selected may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u0092s investments,\nperformance or financial condition, and may\nexpose the Fund to additional tax, accounting\nand regulatory risks.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with\nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a\nsteering committee comprised of large U.S.\nfinancial institutions,\nintends to replace the U.S. dollar LIBOR with\nthe Secured Overnight Financing Rate(SOFR), a\nnew index calculated by short-term repurchase\nagreements, backed by Treasury securities.\nAbandonment of or modifications to LIBOR could\nhave adverse\nimpacts on newly issued financial instruments\nand existing financial instruments which\nreference LIBOR. While some instruments may\ncontemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no\nlonger available by providing for an\nalternative rate setting methodology,\nnot all instruments may have such provisions\nand there are significant uncertainty\nregarding the effectiveness of any such\nalternative methodologies.\n\nIn\n2012, regulators in the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom alleged that some of the member\nbanks surveyed by the British Bankers\nAssociation engaged in manipulative acts in\nconnection with the calculation of LIBOR.\nSeveral financial institutions\nhave reached settlements with the CFTC, the\nU.S. Department of Justice Fraud Section and\nthe United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority\nin connection with investigations by such\nauthorities into submissions made by such\nfinancial institutions to the\nbodies that set LIBOR and other interbank\noffered rates. Additional investigations\nremain ongoing with respect to other major\nbanks. Despite increased regulation and other\ncorrective actions since that time, concerns\nhave arisen regarding\nLIBOR\u0092s viability as a benchmark, due to\ndecreased confidence of the market in LIBOR\nand lead market participants looking for\nalternative, non-LIBOR based types of\nfinancing, such as fixed rate loans or\nbonds or floating rate loans based on non-\nLIBOR indices.\n\n19\n\nMARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING FROM COVID-19\n\nAn outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by\na novel coronavirus first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has spread globally in a short\nperiod of time. In\nan organized attempt to contain and mitigate\nthe effects of the spread of the coronavirus\nknown as COVID-19, governments and businesses\nworld-wide have taken aggressive measures,\nincluding closing borders,\nrestricting international and domestic travel,\nand the imposition of prolonged quarantines of\nlarge populations. COVID-19 has resulted in\nthe disruption of and delays in the delivery\nof healthcare services and\nprocesses, the cancellation of organized\nevents and educational institutions, the\ndisruption of production and supply chains, a\ndecline in consumer demand for certain goods\nand services, and general concern and\nuncertainty, all of which have\ncontributed to increased volatility in global\nmarkets. The effects of COVID-19 will likely\naffect certain sectors and industries more\ndramatically than others, which may adversely\naffect the value of the\nFund\u0092s investments in those sectors or\nindustries. COVID-19, and other epidemics and\npandemics that may arise in the future, could\nadversely affect the economies of many\nnations, the global economy,\nindividual companies and capital markets in\nways that cannot be foreseen at the present\ntime. In addition, the impact of infectious\ndiseases in developing or emerging market\ncountries may be greater due to limited health\ncare resources. Political,\neconomic and social stresses caused by\nCOVID-19 also may exacerbate other pre-\nexisting political, social and economic risks\nin certain countries. The duration of COVID-19\nand its effects cannot be determined at this\ntime, but the effects could be present for an\nextended period of time.\n\nTAX RISKS\n\nAs with any investment, you should consider\nhow your\ninvestment in Shares of the Fund will be\ntaxed. The tax information in the Prospectus\nand this SAI is provided as general\ninformation. You should consult your own tax\nprofessional about the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in Shares of the Fund.\n\nUnless your investment in Shares is made\nthrough a tax-advantaged retirement account,\nsuch as an individual\nretirement account, you need to be aware of\nthe possible tax consequences when the Fund\nmakes distributions or you sell Shares.\n\nINVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe Trust has adopted the following investment\nrestrictions as fundamental policies with\nrespect to the Fund. These\nrestrictions cannot be changed without the\napproval of the holders of a majority of the\nFund\u0092s outstanding voting securities. For\npurposes of the 1940 Act, a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund\nmeans the vote, at an annual\nor a special meeting of the security holders\nof the Trust, of the lesser of (1) 67% or more\nof the voting securities of the Fund present\nat such meeting, if the holders of more than\n50% of the outstanding voting securities of\nthe Fund are\npresent or represented by proxy, or (2) more\nthan 50% of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund. Except with the approval of a\nmajority of the outstanding voting securities,\nthe Fund may not:\n\n1. Concentrate its investments in securities\nof issuers in the same industry, except as may\nbe necessary to approximate the composition of\nthe Fund\u0092s\nunderlying Index;\n\n2. Make loans to another person except as\npermitted by the 1940 Act or other\ngoverning statute, by the Rules thereunder, or\nby the SEC or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund;\n\n3. Issue senior securities or borrow\nmoney, except as permitted by the 1940 Act or\nother governing statute, by the Rules\nthereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory\nagency with authority over the Fund;\n\n4. Invest directly in real estate unless the\nreal estate is acquired as a result of\nownership of securities or other instruments.\nThis restriction shall not\npreclude the Fund from investing in companies\nthat deal in real estate or in instruments\nthat are backed or secured by real estate;\n\n5. Act as an\nunderwriter of another issuer\u0092s securities,\nexcept to the extent the Fund may be deemed to\nbe an underwriter within the meaning of the\nSecurities Act in connection with the Fund\u0092s\npurchase and sale of portfolio securities; or\n\n6. Invest in commodities except as permitted\nby the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other\nregulatory agency\nwith authority over the Fund.\n                                              \n     The SEC Staff considers concentration    \n  1  to involve more than 25% of a fund\u0092s      \n     assets to be invested in an              \n     industry or group of industries.         \n                                              \n20\n\nIn addition to the investment restrictions\nadopted as fundamental policies as set forth\nabove, the Fund observes\nthe following restrictions, which may be\nchanged by the Board without a shareholder\nvote. The Fund will not:\n\n1. Invest in the securities of a company for\nthe purpose of exercising management or\ncontrol, provided that the Trust may vote the\ninvestment securities owned by the Fund in\naccordance with its views;\n\n2. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its total assets in securities\nthat comprise the benchmark Index. Securities\nthat have economic\ncharacteristics substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities\nthat comprise the Index are included within\nthis 80% investment policy; and\n\n3. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of\nborrowings for investment purposes, in\ncorporate bonds. Prior to any\nchange in the Fund\u0092s 80% investment policy,\nthe Fund will provide shareholders with 60\ndays written notice.\n\nThe Fund defines the foregoing terms in\naccordance with the definition of such terms\nper the Index. If a percentage limitation is\nadhered to at the time of investment or\ncontract, a later increase or decrease in\npercentage resulting from any change in value\nor total or net assets will not\nresult in a violation of such restriction,\nexcept that the percentage limitations with\nrespect to the borrowing of money will be\nobserved continuously. With respect to the\nlimitation on borrowing, in the event that a\nsubsequent change in net assets\nor other circumstances cause the Fund to\nexceed its limitation, the Fund will take\nsteps to bring the aggregate amount of\nborrowing back within the limitations within\nthree days thereafter (not including Sundays\nand holidays).\n\nThe 1940 Act currently permits the Fund to\nloan up to 33 1/3% of its total assets. With\nrespect to borrowing, the 1940 Act presently\nallows the Fund to:\n(1) borrow from any bank (including pledging,\nmortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an\namount up to 33 /% of its total assets,\n(2) borrow money for temporary purposes in an\namount not exceeding 5% of the value of the\nFund\u0092s total assets at the time of the loan,\nand (3) enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements. However, under normal\ncircumstances any\nborrowings by the Fund will not exceed 10% of\nthe Fund\u0092s total assets. The 1940 Act\ngenerally prohibits funds from issuing senior\nsecurities, although it does not treat certain\ntransactions as senior securities, such as\ncertain borrowings,\nshort sales, reverse repurchase agreements,\nfirm commitment agreements and standby\ncommitments, with appropriate earmarking or\nsegregation of assets to cover such\nobligation. With respect to investments in\ncommodities, the 1940 Act presently permits\nthe Fund to invest in commodities in\naccordance with investment policies contained\nin its prospectus and SAI. Any such investment\nshall also comply with the CEA and the rules\nand regulations thereunder. The 1940 Act does\nnot directly restrict an\ninvestment company\u0092s ability to invest in real\nestate, but does require that every investment\ncompany have the fundamental investment policy\ngoverning such investments. The Fund will not\npurchase or sell real estate, except that the\nFund may\ninvest in companies that deal in real estate\n(including real estate investment trusts\n(\u0093REITs\u0094)) or in instruments that are backed\nor secured by real estate.\n\nEXCHANGE LISTING AND TRADING\n\nA discussion of exchange listing and trading\nmatters associated with an investment in the\nFund is contained in the Prospectus under\n\u0093PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION\u0094 and \u0093ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION.\u0094 The discussion below\nsupplements, and should be read in conjunction\nwith, such sections of the Prospectus.\n\nThe Shares of the Fund are approved for\nlisting and trading on the Exchange, subject\nto notice of issuance. The Shares trade on the\nExchange at prices that\nmay differ to some degree from their net asset\nvalue. There can be no assurance that the\nrequirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of Shares of the Fund\nwill continue to be met.\n\nThe Exchange may consider the suspension of\ntrading in, and may initiate delisting\nproceedings of, the Shares of the Fund under\nany of the following\ncircumstances: (i) if the Exchange becomes\naware that the Fund is no longer eligible to\noperate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the\n1940 Act; (ii) if the Fund no longer complies\nwith the applicable\nlisting requirements set forth in the\nExchange\u0092s rules; (iii) if, following the\ninitial twelve-month period after commencement\nof trading on the Exchange of the Fund, there\nare fewer than 50 beneficial holders of the\nFund; or (iv) if\nsuch other event shall occur or condition\nexists which, in the opinion of the Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Exchange\ninadvisable. The Exchange will remove the\nShares from listing and trading upon\ntermination of the Fund.\n\nThe Trust reserves the right to adjust the\nFund Share price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments\nwould be accomplished through stock splits or\nreverse stock splits, which would have no\neffect on the net assets of the Fund or an\ninvestor\u0092s equity interest in the Fund.\n\nAs in the case of other publicly traded\nsecurities, brokers\u0092 commissions on\ntransactions will be based on negotiated\ncommission rates at customary\nlevels.\n\nThe base and trading currencies of the Fund is\nthe U.S. dollar. The base currency is the\ncurrency in which the Fund\u0092s net asset value\nper\nShare is calculated and the trading currency\nis the currency in which Shares of the Fund\nare listed and traded on the Exchange.\n\n21\n\nMANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST\n\nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u0093MANAGEMENT.\u0094\n\nBoard Responsibilities. The management and\naffairs of the Trust and its series, including\nthe Fund described in this SAI, are overseen\nby the Trustees. The\nBoard has approved contracts, as described in\nthis SAI, under which certain companies\nprovide essential management services to the\nTrust.\n\nLike most\nmutual funds, the day-to-day business of the\nTrust, including the management of risk, is\nperformed by third party service providers,\nsuch as the Adviser, Distributor,\nAdministrator and Sub-Administrator. The\nTrustees are responsible for overseeing the\nTrust\u0092s service providers and, thus, have\noversight responsibility with respect to risk\nmanagement performed by those\nservice providers. Risk management seeks to\nidentify and address risks, i.e., events or\ncircumstances that could have material adverse\neffects on the business, operations,\nshareholder services, investment performance\nor reputation of the Fund. The\nFund and its service providers employ a\nvariety of processes, procedures and controls\nto identify various of those possible events\nor circumstances, to lessen the probability of\ntheir occurrence and/or to mitigate the\neffects of such events or\ncircumstances if they do occur. Each service\nprovider is responsible for one or more\ndiscrete aspects of the Trust\u0092s business\n(e.g., the Adviser is responsible for the\nday-to-day management of the Fund\u0092s portfolio\ninvestments) and, consequently, for managing\nthe risks associated with that business. The\nBoard has emphasized to the\nFund\u0092s service providers the importance of\nmaintaining vigorous risk management.\n\nThe Trustees\u0092 role in risk oversight begins\nbefore the\ninception of the Fund, at which time the\nFund\u0092s Adviser presents the Board with\ninformation concerning the investment\nobjectives, strategies and risks of the Fund,\nas well as proposed investment limitations for\nthe Fund. Additionally, the\nFund\u0092s Adviser provides the Board with an\noverview of, among other things, their\ninvestment philosophies, brokerage practices\nand compliance infrastructures. Thereafter,\nthe Board continues its oversight function as\nvarious personnel, including\nthe Trust\u0092s Chief Compliance Officer, as well\nas personnel of the Adviser and other service\nproviders, such as the Fund\u0092s independent\naccountants, make periodic reports to the\nAudit Committee or to the Board with respect\nto various aspects\nof risk management. The Board and the Audit\nCommittee oversee efforts by management and\nservice providers to manage risks to which the\nFund may be exposed.\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the\nnature, extent and quality of the services\nprovided to the Fund by the Adviser and\nreceives information about\nthose services at its regular meetings. In\naddition, on an annual basis, in connection\nwith its consideration of whether to renew the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with the\nAdviser, the Board meets with the Adviser to\nreview such services. Among\nother things, the Board regularly considers\nthe Adviser\u0092s adherence to the Fund\u0092s\ninvestment restrictions and compliance with\nvarious Fund policies and procedures and with\napplicable securities regulations. The Board\nalso reviews\ninformation about the Fund\u0092s investments.\n\nThe Trust\u0092s Chief Compliance Officer reports\nregularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance\nissues. At least annually, the Trust\u0092s Chief\nCompliance Officer provides the Board with a\nreport reviewing the adequacy and\neffectiveness of the Trust\u0092s policies and\nprocedures and those of its service providers,\nincluding the Adviser. The\nreport addresses the operation of the policies\nand procedures of the Trust and each service\nprovider since the date of the last report;\nany material changes to the policies and\nprocedures since the date of the last report;\nany recommendations for\nmaterial changes to the policies and\nprocedures; and any material compliance\nmatters since the date of the last report.\n\nThe Board receives reports from\nthe Fund\u0092s service providers regarding\noperational risks and risks related to the\nvaluation and liquidity of portfolio\nsecurities. Regular reports are made to the\nBoard concerning investments for which market\nquotations are not readily\navailable. Annually, the independent\nregistered public accounting firm reviews with\nthe Audit Committee its audit of the Fund\u0092s\nfinancial statements, focusing on major areas\nof risk encountered by the Fund and noting any\nsignificant\ndeficiencies or material weaknesses in the\nFund\u0092s internal controls. Additionally, in\nconnection with its oversight function, the\nBoard oversees Fund management\u0092s\nimplementation of disclosure controls and\nprocedures, which are designed to\nensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports\nwith the SEC are recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the required\ntime periods. The Board also oversees the\nTrust\u0092s internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, which comprise policies\nand procedures designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the\nTrust\u0092s financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Trust\u0092s financial\nstatements.\n\nFrom their review of these reports and\ndiscussions with the Adviser, the Chief\nCompliance Officer, the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and other\nservice providers, the Board and the Audit\nCommittee learn in detail about the material\nrisks of the Fund, thereby facilitating a\ndialogue about how management and service\nproviders identify and mitigate those risks.\n\n22\n\nThe Board recognizes that not all risks that\nmay affect the Fund can be identified and/or\nquantified, that it may\nnot be practical or cost-effective to\neliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it\nmay be necessary to bear certain risks (such\nas investment-related risks) to achieve the\nFund\u0092s goals, and that the processes,\nprocedures and controls employed\nto address certain risks may be limited in\ntheir effectiveness. Moreover, reports\nreceived by the Trustees as to risk management\nmatters are typically summaries of the\nrelevant information. Most of the Fund\u0092s\ninvestment management and business\naffairs are carried out by or through the\nFund\u0092s Adviser and other service providers,\neach of which has an independent interest in\nrisk management but whose policies and the\nmethods by which one or more risk management\nfunctions are carried out\nmay differ from the Fund\u0092s and each other\u0092s in\nthe setting of priorities, the resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. As a result of the foregoing and\nother factors, the Board\u0092s ability to monitor\nand manage\nrisk, as a practical matter, is subject to\nlimitations.\n\nTrustees and Officers. There are seven members\nof the Board of Trustees, six of whom are\nnot interested persons of the Trust, as that\nterm is defined in the 1940 Act (\u0093Independent\nTrustees\u0094). Frank Nesvet, an Independent\nTrustee, serves as Chairman of the Board. The\nBoard has determined its leadership structure\nis appropriate\ngiven the specific characteristics and\ncircumstances of the Trust. The Board made\nthis determination in consideration of, among\nother things, the fact that the Independent\nTrustees constitute a super-majority (greater\nthan 75%) of the Board, the\nfact that the chairperson of each Committee of\nthe Board is an Independent Trustee, the\namount of assets under management in the\nTrust, and the number of funds (and classes of\nshares) overseen by the Board. The Board also\nbelieves that its\nleadership structure facilitates the orderly\nand efficient flow of information to the\nIndependent Trustees from fund management.\n\nThe Board of Trustees\nhas two standing committees: the Audit\nCommittee and Trustee Committee.

The Fund\u0092s\nportfolio holdings are publicly disseminated\neach day the Fund is open for business through\nfinancial reporting and news services\nincluding publicly accessible Internet web\nsites. In addition, a basket\ncomposition file, which includes the security\nnames and share quantities to deliver in\nexchange for Shares, together with estimates\nand actual cash components, is publicly\ndisseminated daily prior to the opening of the\nExchange via the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation (\u0093NSCC\u0094). The\nbasket represents one Creation Unit of the\nFund. The Trust, the Adviser or State Street\nwill not disseminate non-public information\nconcerning the Trust,\nexcept information may be made available prior\nto its public availability: (i) to a party for\na legitimate business purpose related to the\nday-to-day operations of\nthe Fund, including (a) a service provider,\n(b) the stock exchanges upon which the ETF is\nlisted, (c) the NSCC, (d) the Depository Trust\nCompany, and (e) financial data/research\ncompanies such as Morningstar, Bloomberg L.P.,\nand Reuters, or (ii) to any other party for a\nlegitimate business or regulatory purpose,\nupon waiver or exception, with the consent of\nan applicable Trust officer.\n\n31\n\nINVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES\n\nTHE INVESTMENT ADVISER\n\nSSGA FM acts as investment adviser to\nthe Trust and, subject to the oversight of the\nBoard, is responsible for the investment\nmanagement of the Fund. As of September 30 30,\n2020, the Adviser managed approximately\n$579.94 billion in assets. The Adviser\u0092s\nprincipal address\nis One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts\n02210. The Adviser, a Massachusetts\ncorporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nState Street Global Advisors, Inc., which is\nitself a wholly-owned subsidiary of State\nStreet Corporation, a publicly held\nfinancial holding company. State Street Global\nAdvisors (\u0093SSGA\u0094), consisting of the Adviser\nand other investment advisory affiliates of\nState Street Corporation, is the investment\nmanagement arm of State Street Corporation.\n\nThe Adviser serves as investment adviser to\nthe Fund pursuant to an investment advisory\nagreement (\u0093Investment Advisory Agreement\u0094)\nbetween the\nTrust and the Adviser. The Investment Advisory\nAgreement, with respect to the Fund, continues\nin effect for two years from its effective\ndate, and thereafter is subject to annual\napproval by (1) the Board or (2) vote of a\nmajority of the\noutstanding voting securities (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Fund, provided that in\neither event such continuance also is approved\nby a majority of the Board who are not\ninterested persons (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Trust by a vote\ncast in person at a meeting called for the\npurpose of voting on such approval. The\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with respect to\nthe Fund is terminable without penalty, on 60\ndays\u0092 notice, by the Board or by a vote of the\nholders of a majority\n(as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund\u0092s\noutstanding voting securities. The Investment\nAdvisory Agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays\u0092 notice by the Adviser and will terminate\nautomatically in the event of its assignment\n(as defined\nin the 1940 Act).\n\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, the\nAdviser, subject to the oversight of the Board\nand in conformity with the stated\ninvestment policies of the Fund, manages the\ninvestment of the Fund\u0092s assets. The Adviser\nis responsible for placing purchase and sale\norders and providing continuous supervision of\nthe investment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant\nto the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is\nnot liable for certain liabilities, including\ncertain liabilities arising under the federal\nsecurities laws, unless such loss or liability\nresults from willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence\nin the performance of its duties or the\nreckless disregard of its obligations and\nduties.\n\nFor the services provided to the Fund under\nthe Investment\nAdvisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser\nmonthly fees based on a percentage of the\nFund\u0092s average daily net assets as set forth\nin the Fund\u0092s Prospectus. From time to time,\nthe Adviser may waive all or a portion of its\nfee. The\nAdviser has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fee and/or reimburse\nexpenses in an amount equal to any acquired\nfund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in\nacquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) for the Fund\nuntil October 31, 2021. This contractual fee\nwaiver and/or reimbursement does not provide\nfor the recoupment by the Adviser of any fees\nthe Adviser previously waived. The Adviser may\ncontinue the waiver and/or reimbursement from\nyear to year,\nbut there is no guarantee that the Adviser\nwill do so and the waiver and/or reimbursement\nmay be cancelled or modified at any time after\nOctober 31, 2021. The waiver and/or\nreimbursement may not be terminated prior to\nOctober 31, 2021\nexcept with the approval of the Board. The\nAdviser pays all expenses of the Fund other\nthan the management fee, brokerage, taxes,\ninterest, fees and expenses of the Independent\nTrustees (including any Trustee\u0092s counsel\nfees), acquired fund fees\nand expenses, litigation expenses and other\nextraordinary expenses.\n\nA summary of the factors considered by the\nBoard of Trustees in connection with the\ninitial approval of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement for the Fund will be available in\nthe Fund\u0092s first shareholder report after the\nFund commences operations.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not pay\nfees to the Adviser for the past three fiscal\nyears.\n\nPORTFOLIO MANAGERS\n\nThe Adviser manages the Fund using a team of\ninvestment professionals. The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management of the Fund are Michael\nBrunell, Christopher DiStefano and\nFrank Miethe. The following table lists the\nnumber and types of accounts managed by each\nof the key professionals involved in the day-\nto-day portfolio management for the\nFund and assets under management in those\naccounts. The total number of accounts and\nassets have been allocated to each respective\nmanager. Therefore, some accounts and assets\nhave been counted twice.\n\n32\n\nOther Accounts Managed as of September 30,\n2020:\n                                              \n                  \u2026                           \n      \u2026           \u2026                           \n      \u2026           \u2026      \u2026                    \n      \u2026           \u2026      \u2026                    \n      \u2026           \u2026      \u2026                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      \u2026    $      \u2026      \u2026        $      $    \n      \u2026    $      \u2026      \u2026        $      $    \n      \u2026    $      \u2026      \u2026        $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  There are no performance-based fees      \n     associated with these accounts.          \n                                              \nThe Fund had not commenced operations prior to\nthe date of this SAI and therefore the\nportfolio managers did not beneficially own\nany Shares.\n\nA portfolio manager that has responsibility\nfor managing more than one account may be\nsubject to potential conflicts of interest\nbecause he or she is\nresponsible for other accounts in addition to\nthe Fund. Those conflicts could include\npreferential treatment of one account over\nothers in terms of: (a) the portfolio\nmanager\u0092s execution of different investment\nstrategies for various\naccounts or (b) the allocation of resources or\nof investment opportunities.\n\nPortfolio managers may manage numerous\naccounts for multiple clients.\nThese accounts may include registered\ninvestment companies, other types of pooled\naccounts (e.g., collective investment funds),\nand separate accounts (i.e., accounts managed\non behalf of individuals or public or private\ninstitutions).\nPortfolio managers make investment decisions\nfor each account based on the investment\nobjectives and policies and other relevant\ninvestment considerations applicable to that\nportfolio.\n\nA potential conflict of interest may arise as\na result of the portfolio managers\u0092\nresponsibility for multiple accounts with\nsimilar investment\nguidelines. Under these circumstances, a\npotential investment may be suitable for more\nthan one of the portfolio managers\u0092 accounts,\nbut the quantity of the investment available\nfor purchase is less than the aggregate amount\nthe accounts would\nideally devote to the opportunity. Similar\nconflicts may arise when multiple accounts\nseek to dispose of the same investment. The\nportfolio managers may also manage accounts\nwhose objectives and policies differ from that\nof the Fund. These\ndifferences may be such that under certain\ncircumstances, trading activity appropriate\nfor one account managed by the portfolio\nmanager may have adverse consequences for\nanother account managed by the portfolio\nmanager. For example, an account may\nsell a significant position in a security,\nwhich could cause the market price of that\nsecurity to decrease, while the Fund\nmaintained its position in that security.\n\nA potential conflict may arise when the\nportfolio managers are responsible for\naccounts that have different advisory fees\u0097the\ndifference in fees could\ncreate an incentive for the portfolio manager\nto favor one account over another, for\nexample, in terms of access to investment\nopportunities. Another potential conflict may\narise when the portfolio manager has an\ninvestment in one or more accounts\nthat participate in transactions with other\naccounts. His or her investment(s) may create\nan incentive for the portfolio manager to\nfavor one account over another. The Adviser\nhas adopted policies and procedures reasonably\ndesigned to address these\npotential material conflicts. For instance,\nportfolio managers are normally responsible\nfor all accounts within a certain investment\ndiscipline, and do not, absent special\ncircumstances, differentiate among the various\naccounts when allocating\nresources. Additionally, the Adviser and its\nadvisory affiliates have processes and\nprocedures for allocating investment\nopportunities among portfolios that are\ndesigned to provide a fair and equitable\nallocation.\n\nSSGA\u0092s culture is complemented and reinforced\nby a total rewards strategy that is based on a\npay for performance philosophy which seeks to\noffer a\ncompetitive pay mix of base salary, benefits,\ncash incentives and deferred compensation.\n\nSalary is based on a number of factors,\nincluding external\nbenchmarking data and market trends, State\nStreet performance, SSGA performance, and\nindividual overall performance. SSGA\u0092s Global\nHuman Resources department regularly\nparticipates in compensation surveys in order\nto provide SSGA with\nmarket-based compensation information that\nhelps support individual pay decisions.\n\nAdditionally, subject to State Street and SSGA\nbusiness results, State\nStreet allocates an incentive pool to SSGA to\nreward its employees. The size of the\nincentive pool for most business units is\nbased on the firm\u0092s overall profitability and\nother factors, including performance against\nrisk-related goals. For\nmost SSGA investment teams, SSGA recognizes\nand rewards performance by linking annual\nincentive decisions for investment teams to\nthe firm\u0092s or business unit\u0092s profitability\nand business unit investment performance over\na multi-year\nperiod.\n\n33\n\nIncentive pool funding for most active\ninvestment teams is driven in part by the\npost-tax investment performance of fund(s)\nmanaged by the team versus the return levels\nof the benchmark index(es) of the fund(s) on a\none-, three- and, in some cases,\nfive-year basis. For most active investment\nteams, a material portion of incentive\ncompensation for senior staff is deferred over\na four-year period into the SSGA Long-Term\nIncentive (\u0093SSGA LTI\u0094) program. For these\nteams, The SSGA LTI\nprogram indexes the performance of these\ndeferred awards against the post-tax\ninvestment performance of fund(s) managed by\nthe team. This is intended to align our\ninvestment team\u0092s compensation with\nclient interests, both through annual\nincentive compensation awards and through the\nlong-term value of deferred awards in the SSGA\nLTI program.\n\nFor the\npassive equity investment team, incentive pool\nfunding is driven in part by the post-tax 1\nand 3-year tracking error of the funds managed\nby the team against the\nbenchmark indexes of the funds.\n\nThe discretionary allocation of the incentive\npool to the business units within SSGA is\ninfluenced by market-based\ncompensation data, as well as the overall\nperformance of each business unit. Individual\ncompensation decisions are made by the\nemployee\u0092s manager, in conjunction with the\nsenior management of the employee\u0092s business\nunit. These decisions\nare based on the overall performance of the\nemployee and, as mentioned above, on the\nperformance of the firm and business unit.\nDepending on the job level, a portion of the\nannual incentive may be awarded in deferred\ncompensation, which may include\ncash and/or Deferred Stock Awards (State\nStreet stock), which typically vest over a\nfour-year period. This helps to retain staff\nand further aligns SSGA employees\u0092 interests\nwith SSGA clients\u0092 and shareholders\u0092 long-term\ninterests.\n\nSSGA recognizes and rewards outstanding\nperformance by:\n                                              \n      Promoting employee ownership to         \n      connect employees directly to the       \n      company\u0092s success.                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      Using rewards to reinforce mission,     \n      vision, values and business strategy.   \n                                              \n                                              \n      Seeking to recognize and preserve the   \n      firm\u0092s unique culture and team           \n      orientation.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n      Providing all employees the             \n      opportunity to share in the success of  \n      SSGA.                                   \n                                              \nTHE ADMINISTRATOR, SUB-ADMINISTRATOR,\nCUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT\n\nAdministrator. SSGA FM serves as the\nadministrator to each series of the Trust,\npursuant to an Administration Agreement dated\nJune 1, 2015 (the\n\u0093SSGA Administration Agreement\u0094). Pursuant to\nthe SSGA Administration Agreement, SSGA FM is\nobligated to continuously provide business\nmanagement services to the Trust and its\nseries and will generally, subject to the\ngeneral oversight of\nthe Trustees and except as otherwise provided\nin the SSGA Administration Agreement, manage\nall of the business and affairs of the Trust.\n\nSub-Administrator,Custodian and Transfer\nAgent. State Street serves as the sub-\nadministrator to each series of the Trust,\npursuant to a\nSub-Administration Agreement dated June 1,\n2015 (the \u0093Sub-Administration Agreement\u0094).\nUnder the Sub-Administration\nAgreement, State Street is obligated to\nprovide certain sub-administrative services to\nthe Trust and its series. State Street is a\nwholly owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation, a publicly held financial\nholding company, and is affiliated with the\nAdviser. State Street\u0092s mailing address is\nState Street Financial Center, One Lincoln\nStreet, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.\n\nState Street also serves as Custodian for the\nTrust\u0092s series pursuant to a custodian\nagreement (\u0093Custodian Agreement\u0094). As\nCustodian, State\nStreet holds Fund assets, calculates the net\nasset value of the Shares and calculates net\nincome and realized capital gains or losses.\nState Street and the Trust will comply with\nthe self-custodian provisions of Rule\n17f-2 under the 1940 Act.\n\nState Street also serves as Transfer Agent for\neach series of the Trust pursuant to a\ntransfer agency agreement (\u0093Transfer Agency\nAgreement\u0094).\n\nCompensation. As compensation for its services\nprovided under the SSGA\nAdministration agreement, SSGA FM, shall\nreceive fees for the services, calculated\nbased on the average aggregate net assets of\nthe Trust and SPDR Index Shares Funds, which\nare accrued daily and paid monthly out of its\nmanagement fee.\n\nAs compensation for its services under the\nSub-Administration Agreement, Custodian\nAgreement and Transfer Agency\nAgreement, State Street shall receive a fee\nfor the services, calculated based on the\naverage aggregate net assets of the Trust and\nSIS, which are accrued daily and paid monthly\nby the Adviser from its management fee.

State Street\nmay be reimbursed for its out-of-pocket\nexpenses. The Investment Advisory Agreement\nprovides that the Adviser will pay certain\noperating expenses of the Trust, including the\nfees due to State Street under the Custodian\nAgreement and\nthe Transfer Agency Agreement.\n\n34\n\nTHE DISTRIBUTOR\n\nState Street Global Advisors Funds\nDistributors, LLC is the principal underwriter\nand Distributor of Shares. Its principal\naddress is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. Investor information can\nbe obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257. The\nDistributor has entered into a\ndistribution agreement (\u0093Distribution\nAgreement\u0094) with the Trust pursuant to which\nit distributes Shares of the Fund. The\nDistribution Agreement will continue for two\nyears from its effective date and is renewable\nannually thereafter.\nShares will be continuously offered for sale\nby the Trust through the Distributor only in\nCreation Units, as described in the Prospectus\nand below under \u0093Purchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units.\u0094 Shares in less than Creation\nUnits are\nnot distributed by the Distributor. The\nDistributor will deliver the Prospectus to\npersons purchasing Creation Units and will\nmaintain records of both orders placed with it\nand confirmations of acceptance furnished by\nit. The Distributor is a\nbroker-dealer registered under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 (the \u0093Exchange Act\u0094) and\na member of the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority (\u0093FINRA\u0094). The Distributor has no\nrole in determining the investment policies of\nthe Trust or which securities are to be\npurchased or sold by the Trust. An affiliate\nof the Distributor may assist Authorized\nParticipants (as defined below) in assembling\nshares to purchase Creation Units or upon\nredemption, for which it may\nreceive commissions or other fees from such\nAuthorized Participants. An affiliate of the\nDistributor also receives compensation from\nState Street for providing on-line creation\nand redemption functionality to\nAuthorized Participants through its Fund\nConnect application.\n\nThe Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of\nthe Adviser or Distributor, may directly or\nindirectly make cash payments to certain\nbroker-dealers for participating in activities\nthat are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives and other professionals more\nknowledgeable about exchange traded products,\nincluding the SPDR funds, or for\nother activities, such as participation in\nmarketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems.\n\nIn addition, as of the date of this SAI, the\nAdviser and/or Distributor had arrangements\nwhereby they may make payments, other than for\nthe educational\nprograms and marketing activities described\nabove, to Pershing LLC (\u0093Pershing\u0094), RBC\nCapital Markets, LLC (\u0093RBC\u0094), LPL Financial,\nLLC (\u0093LPL\u0094), and Morgan Stanley Wealth\nManagement, LLC. These amounts, which may be\nsignificant, are paid by the Adviser and/or\nDistributor from their own resources and not\nfrom Fund assets. Pursuant to these\narrangements, Pershing, RBC and LPL have\nagreed to offer certain SPDR funds to their\ncustomers and not to charge certain of\ntheir customers any commissions when those\ncustomers purchase or sell shares of certain\nSPDR funds. Payments to a broker-dealer or\nintermediary may create potential conflicts of\ninterest between the broker dealer or\nintermediary and its clients.\n\nIn addition, the Adviser or Distributor, or an\naffiliate of the Adviser or Distributor, as\nwell as an index provider that is not\naffiliated with the\nAdviser or Distributor, may also reimburse\nexpenses or make payments from their own\nassets to other persons in consideration of\nservices or other activities that they believe\nmay benefit the SPDR business or facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds.\n\nThe Distribution Agreement provides that it\nmay be terminated at any time, without the\npayment of any penalty, as to the Fund: (i) by\nvote of a majority\nof the Independent Trustees or (ii) by vote of\na majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\noutstanding voting securities of the Fund, on\nat least 60 days written notice to the\nDistributor. The Distribution Agreement is\nalso terminable upon\n60 days\u0092 notice by the Distributor and will\nterminate automatically in the event of its\nassignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).\n\nThe continuation of\nthe Distribution Agreement and any other\nrelated agreements is subject to annual\napproval of the Board, including by a majority\nof the Independent Trustees, as described\nabove.\n\nThe allocation among the Trust\u0092s series of\nfees and expenses payable under the\nDistribution Agreement will be made pro rata\nin accordance with the daily\nnet assets of the respective series.\n\nThe Distributor may also enter into agreements\nwith securities dealers (\u0093Soliciting Dealers\u0094)\nwho will\nsolicit purchases of Creation Unit\naggregations of Shares. Such Soliciting\nDealers may also be Participating Parties (as\ndefined in the \u0093Book Entry Only System\u0094\nsection below) and/or DTC Participants (as\ndefined below).\n\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the\nTrust has agreed to indemnify the Distributor,\nand may indemnify Soliciting Dealers and\nAuthorized Participants\n(as described below) entering into agreements\nwith the Distributor, for certain liabilities,\nincluding certain liabilities arising under\nthe federal securities laws, unless such loss\nor liability results from willful misfeasance,\nbad faith or gross\nnegligence in the performance of its duties or\nthe reckless disregard of its obligations and\nduties under the Distribution Agreement or\nother agreement, as applicable.\n\nINDEX PROVIDER AND OTHER PERSONS\n\nAn unaffiliated index provider\nmay make payments from its own assets to other\npersons in consideration for services provided\nor other activities that may facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds.\n\n35\n\nBROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS\n\nAll portfolio transactions are placed on\nbehalf of the Fund by the Adviser. Purchases\nand sales of securities on a securities\nexchange are affected through\nbrokers who charge a commission for their\nservices. Ordinarily commissions are not\ncharged on over the counter orders (e.g.,\nfixed income securities) because the Fund pays\na spread which is included in the cost of the\nsecurity and represents the\ndifference between the dealer\u0092s quoted price\nat which it is willing to sell the security\nand the dealer\u0092s quoted price at which it is\nwilling to buy the security. When the Fund\nexecutes an over the counter order with an\nelectronic\ncommunications network or an alternative\ntrading system, a commission is charged\nbecause electronic communications networks and\nalternative trading systems execute such\norders on an agency basis. Securities may be\npurchased from underwriters at\nprices that include underwriting fees.\n\nIn placing a portfolio transaction, the\nAdviser seeks to achieve best execution. The\nAdviser\u0092s duty to seek\nbest execution requires the Adviser to take\nreasonable steps to obtain for the client as\nfavorable an overall result as possible for\nFund portfolio transactions under the\ncircumstances, taking into account various\nfactors that are relevant to the\nparticular transaction.\n\nThe Adviser refers to and selects from the\nlist of approved trading counterparties\nmaintained by the Adviser\u0092s Credit Risk\nManagement team. In selecting a trading\ncounterparty for a particular trade, the\nAdviser seeks to weigh relevant factors\nincluding, but not limited to the following:\n                                      \n      Prompt and reliable execution;  \n                                      \n                                              \n      The competitiveness of commission       \n      rates and spreads, if applicable;       \n                                              \n                                              \n      The financial strength, stability       \n      and/or reputation of the trading        \n      counterparty;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      The willingness and ability of the      \n      executing trading counterparty to       \n      execute transactions (and commit        \n      capital) of                             \n      size in liquid and illiquid markets     \n      without disrupting the market for the   \n      security;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      Local laws, regulations or              \n      restrictions;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      The ability of the trading              \n      counterparty to maintain                \n      confidentiality;                        \n                                              \n                                              \n      The availability and capability of      \n      execution venues, including electronic  \n      communications networks for trading     \n      and                                     \n      execution management systems made       \n      available to Adviser;                   \n                                              \n                     \n      Market share;  \n                     \n                  \n      Liquidity;  \n                  \n              \n      Price;  \n              \n                                \n      Execution related costs;  \n                                \n                                       \n      History of execution of orders;  \n                                       \n                                              \n      Likelihood of execution and             \n      settlement;                             \n                                              \n                              \n      Order size and nature;  \n                              \n                                              \n      Clearing and settlement capabilities,   \n      especially in high volatility market    \n      environments;                           \n                                              \n                                            \n      Availability of lendable securities;  \n                                            \n                                              \n      Sophistication of the trading           \n      counterparty\u0092s trading capabilities and  \n      infrastructure/facilities;              \n                                              \n                                              \n      The operational efficiency with which   \n      transactions are processed and          \n      cleared, taking into account the order  \n      size                                    \n      and complexity;                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      Speed and responsiveness to the         \n      Adviser;                                \n                                              \n                                    \n      Access to secondary markets;  \n                                    \n                                  \n      Counterparty exposure; and  \n                                  \n                                              \n      Any other consideration the Adviser     \n      believes is relevant to the execution   \n      of the order.                           \n                                              \nIn selecting a trading counterparty, the price\nof the transaction and costs related to the\nexecution of the transaction typically merit a\nhigh relative\nimportance, depending on the circumstances.\nThe Adviser does not necessarily select a\ntrading counterparty based upon price and\ncosts but may take other relevant factors into\naccount if it believes that these are\nimportant in taking reasonable steps\nto obtain the best possible result for the\nFund under the circumstances. Consequently,\nthe Adviser may cause a client to pay a\ntrading counterparty more than another trading\ncounterparty might have charged for the same\ntransaction in recognition of\nthe value and\n\n36\n\nquality of the brokerage services provided.\nThe following matters may influence the\nrelative importance that the Adviser places\nupon the relevant factors:\n\n(i) The nature and characteristics of the\norder or transaction. For example, size of\norder, market impact of order, limits, or\nother\ninstructions relating to the order;\n\n(ii) The characteristics of the financial\ninstrument(s) or other assets which are the\nsubject of that\norder. For example, whether the order pertains\nto an equity, fixed income, derivative or\nconvertible instrument;\n\n(iii) The characteristics\nof the execution venues to which that order\ncan be directed, if relevant. For example,\navailability and capabilities of electronic\ntrading systems;\n\n(iv) Whether the transaction is a \u0091delivery\nversus payment\u0092 or \u0091over the counter\u0092\ntransaction. The creditworthiness of the\ntrading counterparty, the amount of existing\nexposure to a trading counterparty and trading\ncounterparty settlement capabilities may be\ngiven a higher relative importance in the case\nof \u0091over the counter\u0092 transactions; and\n\n(v) Any other circumstances relevant the\nAdviser believes is relevant at the time.\n\nThe process by which trading counterparties\nare selected to effect transactions is\ndesigned to exclude consideration of the sales\nefforts conducted by\nbroker-dealers in relation to the Fund.\n\nThe Adviser does not currently use the Fund\u0092s\nassets in connection with third party soft\ndollar\narrangements. While the Adviser does not\ncurrently use \u0093soft\u0094 or commission dollars\npaid by the Fund for the purchase of third\nparty research, the Adviser reserves the right\nto do so in the future.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not pay\nbrokerage commissions during the past three\nfiscal years.\n\nSecurities of \u0093Regular Broker-Dealers.\u0094 The\nFund is required to identify any securities of\nits \u0093regular brokers and dealers\u0094 (as such\nterm\nis defined in the 1940 Act) which it may hold\nat the close of its most recent fiscal year.\n\u0093Regular brokers or dealers\u0094 of the Trust are\nthe ten brokers or dealers that, during the\nmost recent fiscal year: (i) received the\ngreatest\ndollar amounts of brokerage commissions from\nthe Trust\u0092s portfolio transactions; (ii)\nengaged as principal in the largest dollar\namounts of portfolio transactions of the\nTrust; or (iii) sold the largest dollar\namounts of the\nTrust\u0092s shares.\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any holdings in Securities of Regular\nBroker-Dealers as of June 30, 2020.\n\nPortfolio Turnover. Portfolio turnover may\nvary from year to year, as well as within a\nyear. High turnover\nrates are likely to result in comparatively\ngreater brokerage expenses or transaction\ncosts. The overall reasonableness of brokerage\ncommissions and transaction costs is evaluated\nby the Adviser based upon its knowledge of\navailable information as\nto the general level of commissions and\ntransaction costs paid by other institutional\ninvestors for comparable services.\n\nBOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM\n\nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled\n\u0093ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION.\u0094\n\nThe Depository Trust Company (\u0093DTC\u0094) acts as\nsecurities depositary for the Shares. Shares\nof the Fund are represented by securities\nregistered in the name of DTC or its nominee,\nCede & Co., and deposited with, or on behalf\nof, DTC. Except in the limited circumstance\nprovided below, certificates will not be\nissued for Shares.\n\nDTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was\ncreated to hold securities of its participants\n(the \u0093DTC Participants\u0094) and to facilitate the\nclearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions among the DTC Participants in\nsuch securities through electronic book-entry\nchanges in accounts of the DTC Participants,\nthereby eliminating the need for physical\nmovement of securities\ncertificates. DTC Participants include\nsecurities brokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations and certain\nother organizations, some of whom (and/or\ntheir representatives) own DTC. More\nspecifically, DTC is owned by a number of\nits DTC Participants and by the New York Stock\nExchange (\u0093NYSE\u0094) and FINRA. Access to the DTC\nsystem is also available to others such as\nbanks, brokers, dealers and trust companies\nthat clear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship\nwith a DTC Participant, either directly or\nindirectly (the \u0093Indirect Participants\u0094).\n\n37\n\nBeneficial ownership of Shares is limited to\nDTC Participants, Indirect Participants and\npersons holding\ninterests through DTC Participants and\nIndirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in Shares (owners of such beneficial\ninterests are referred to herein as\n\u0093Beneficial Owners\u0094) is shown on, and the\ntransfer of ownership is\neffected only through, records maintained by\nDTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on\nthe records of DTC Participants (with respect\nto Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive\nfrom or through the DTC Participant a written\nconfirmation relating to their purchase of\nShares.\n\nConveyance of all notices, statements and\nother\ncommunications to Beneficial Owners is\neffected as follows. Pursuant to the\nDepositary Agreement between the Trust and\nDTC, DTC is required to make available to the\nTrust upon request and for a fee to be charged\nto the Trust a listing of the Shares\nof the Fund held by each DTC Participant. The\nTrust, either directly or through a third\nparty service, shall inquire of each such DTC\nParticipant as to the number of Beneficial\nOwners holding Shares, directly or indirectly,\nthrough such DTC\nParticipant. The Trust, either directly or\nthrough a third party service, shall provide\neach such DTC Participant with copies of such\nnotice, statement or other communication, in\nsuch form, number and at such place as such\nDTC Participant may\nreasonably request, in order that such notice,\nstatement or communication may be transmitted\nby such DTC Participant, directly or\nindirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In\naddition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC\nParticipant and/or third party\nservice a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to\nsuch transmittal, all subject to applicable\nstatutory and regulatory requirements.\n\nShare distributions shall be made to DTC or\nits nominee, Cede & Co., as the registered\nholder of all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon\nreceipt of any\nsuch distributions, shall credit immediately\nDTC Participants\u0092 accounts with payments in\namounts proportionate to their respective\nbeneficial interests in Shares of the Fund as\nshown on the records of DTC or its nominee.\nPayments by DTC\nParticipants to Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners of Shares held through such\nDTC Participants will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is\nnow the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in\nbearer form or registered in a \u0093street name,\u0094\nand will be the responsibility of such DTC\nParticipants.\n\nThe Trust has no responsibility or\nliability for any aspects of the records\nrelating to or notices to Beneficial Owners,\nor payments made on account of beneficial\nownership interests in such Shares, or for\nmaintaining, supervising or reviewing any\nrecords relating to such beneficial\nownership interests or for any other aspect of\nthe relationship between DTC and the DTC\nParticipants or the relationship between such\nDTC Participants and the Indirect Participants\nand Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC\nParticipants.\n\nDTC may determine to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to Shares at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its\nresponsibilities with respect thereto under\napplicable law. Under such circumstances, the\nTrust shall take action either to find a\nreplacement for DTC to perform its functions\nat a comparable cost or, if such a replacement\nis unavailable, to issue\nand deliver printed certificates representing\nownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes\nother arrangements with respect thereto\nsatisfactory to the Exchange.\n\nCONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF\nSECURITIES\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations prior to\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any beneficial owners that owned greater\nthan 5% of the\noutstanding voting securities as of the date\nof this SAI.\n\nAn Authorized Participant (as defined below)\nmay hold of record more than 25% of the\noutstanding Shares. From time to time,\nAuthorized Participants may be a beneficial\nand/or legal owner of the Fund, may be\naffiliated with an index provider, may be\ndeemed to have control of the Fund and/or may\nbe able to affect the outcome of\nmatters presented for a vote of the\nshareholders of the Fund. Authorized\nParticipants may execute an irrevocable proxy\ngranting the Distributor or another affiliate\nof State Street (the \u0093Agent\u0094) power to vote or\nabstain from voting such\nAuthorized Participant\u0092s beneficially or\nlegally owned Shares. In such cases, the Agent\nshall mirror vote (or abstain from voting)\nsuch Shares in the same proportion as all\nother beneficial owners of the Fund.\n\nThe Trustees and Officers of the Trust, as a\ngroup, own less than 1% of the Trust\u0092s voting\nsecurities as of the date of this SAI.\n\nPURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\n\nThe Fund issues and redeems its Shares on a\ncontinuous basis, at net asset value, only in\na large specified number of Shares called a\n\u0093Creation\nUnit.\u0094 The value of the Fund is determined\nonce each business day, as described under\n\u0093Determination of Net Asset Value.\u0094 The\nCreation Unit size of the Fund may change.\nAuthorized Participants (as defined below)\nwill be notified of\nsuch change. The principal consideration for\ncreations and redemptions for the Fund is in-\nkind, although this may be revised at any time\nwithout notice.\n\nPURCHASE (CREATION). The Trust issues and\nsells Shares of the Fund only in Creation\nUnits on a continuous basis through the\nPrincipal Underwriter, without a\nsales load (but subject to transaction fees),\nat their NAV per share next determined after\nreceipt of an order, on any Business Day (as\ndefined below), in proper form pursuant to the\nterms of the Authorized Participant Agreement\n(\u0093Participant\nAgreement\u0094). A \u0093Business Day\u0094 with respect to\nthe Fund is, generally, any day on which the\nNYSE is open for business, with the exception\nof Veterans Day and Columbus Day.\n\n38\n\nFUND DEPOSIT. The consideration for purchase\nof a Creation Unit of the Fund generally\nconsists of either\n(i) the Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent (defined below), computed as\ndescribed below; or (ii) the cash value of the\nDeposit Securities and \u0093Cash Component,\u0094\ncomputed as described below. When accepting\npurchases of\nCreation Units for cash, the Fund may incur\nadditional costs associated with the\nacquisition of Deposit Securities that would\notherwise be provided by an in-kind purchaser.\n\nTogether, the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u0093Fund Deposit,\u0094 which\nrepresents the minimum\ninitial and subsequent investment amount for a\nCreation Unit of the Fund. The \u0093Cash\nComponent\u0094 which may include a Dividend\nEquivalent Payment, is an amount equal to the\ndifference between the net asset value of the\nShares (per Creation\nUnit) and the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. The\n\u0093Dividend Equivalent Payment\u0094 enables the Fund\nto make a complete distribution of dividends\non the day preceding the next dividend payment\ndate, and\nis an amount equal, on a per Creation Unit\nbasis, to the dividends on all the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund (\u0093Dividend Securities\u0094)\nwith ex-dividend dates within the accumulation\nperiod for such\ndistribution (the \u0093Accumulation Period\u0094), net\nof expenses and liabilities for such period,\nas if all of the Dividend Securities had been\nheld by the Fund for the entire Accumulation\nPeriod. The Accumulation Period begins on the\nex-dividend date for the Fund and ends on the\nday preceding the next ex-dividend date. If\nthe Cash Component is a positive number (i.e.,\nthe net asset value per\nCreation Unit exceeds the market value of the\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable), the Cash Component shall be such\npositive amount. If the Cash Component is a\nnegative number (i.e., the net asset value per\nCreation Unit is\nless than the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),\nthe Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to\nreceive cash in an amount equal to the Cash\nComponent. The Cash Component\nserves the function of compensating for any\ndifferences between the net asset value per\nCreation Unit and the market value of the\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable. Computation of the Cash Component\nexcludes any stamp duty or other\nsimilar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities, if applicable, which shall\nbe the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below).\n\nThe Custodian, through NSCC, makes available\non each Business Day, prior to the opening of\nbusiness on the NYSE (currently 9:30 a.m.,\nEastern time), the list\nof the names and the required number of shares\nof each Deposit Security or the required\namount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, to be\nincluded in the current standard Fund Deposit\n(based on information at the end of the\nprevious Business Day) for the\nFund. Such standard Fund Deposit is subject to\nany applicable adjustments as described below,\nin order to effect purchases of Creation Units\nof the Fund until such time as the next-\nannounced composition of the Deposit\nSecurities or the required\namount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, is made\navailable.\n\nThe identity and number of shares of the\nDeposit Securities or the amount of Deposit\nCash, as\napplicable, required for a Fund Deposit for\nthe Fund may be changed from time to time by\nthe Adviser with a view to the investment\nobjective of the Fund. Information regarding a\nFund Deposit necessary for the purchase of a\nCreation Unit is made\navailable to Authorized Participants and other\nmarket participants seeking to transact in\nCreation Unit aggregations.\n\nAs noted above, the Trust reserves\nthe right to permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Cash to replace any\nDeposit Security, which shall be added to the\nCash Component, including, without limitation,\nin situations where the Deposit Security: (i)\nmay not be available in\nsufficient quantity for delivery, (ii) may not\nbe eligible for transfer through the systems\nof DTC for corporate securities and municipal\nsecurities or the Federal Reserve System for\nU.S. Treasury securities; (iii) may not be\neligible for\ntrading by an Authorized Participant (as\ndefined below) or the investor for which it is\nacting; (iv) would be restricted under the\nsecurities laws or where the delivery of the\nDeposit Security to the Authorized Participant\nwould result in the\ndisposition of the Deposit Security by the\nAuthorized Participant becoming restricted\nunder the securities laws, or (v) in certain\nother situations (collectively, \u0093non-standard\norders\u0094). The\nTrust also reserves the right to: (i) permit\nor require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of Deposit Cash; and (ii)\ninclude or remove Deposit Securities from the\nbasket in anticipation of portfolio changes.\nThe adjustments\ndescribed above will reflect changes, known to\nthe Adviser on the date of announcement to be\nin effect by the time of delivery of the Fund\nDeposit, in the composition of the subject\nIndex being tracked by the Fund or resulting\nfrom certain corporate\nactions.\n\nPROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS. To\nbe eligible to place orders with the Principal\nUnderwriter, as facilitated via the Transfer\nAgent,\nto purchase a Creation Unit of the Fund, an\nentity must be (i) a \u0093Participating Party\u0094,\ni.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in\nthe clearing process through the Continuous\nNet Settlement System of the NSCC (the\n\u0093Clearing Process\u0094), a clearing agency that is\nregistered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC\nParticipant (see \u0093BOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM\u0094) and\nhave the ability to clear through the Federal\nReserve System. In addition, each\nParticipating Party or DTC Participant (each,\nan \u0093Authorized Participant\u0094) must execute a\nParticipant Agreement that has been agreed to\nby the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer\nAgent, and that has been accepted by the\nTrust, with\nrespect to purchases and redemptions of\nCreation Units. Each Authorized Participant\nwill agree, pursuant to the terms of a\nParticipant Agreement, on behalf of itself or\nany investor on whose behalf it will act, to\ncertain conditions, including that\nit will pay to the Trust, an amount of cash\nsufficient to pay the Cash Component together\nwith the creation transaction fee (described\nbelow) and any other applicable fees, taxes\nand additional variable charge.\n\n39\n\nAll orders to purchase Shares directly from\nthe Fund, including\nnon-standard orders, must be placed for one or\nmore Creation Units and in the manner and by\nthe time set forth in the Participant\nAgreement and/or the applicable order form.\nThe date on which an order to\npurchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem\nCreation Units, as set forth below) is\nreceived and accepted is referred to as the\n\u0093Order Placement Date.\u0094\n\nAn Authorized Participant may require an\ninvestor to make certain representations or\nenter into agreements with respect to the\norder (e.g., to provide\nfor payments of cash, when required).\nInvestors should be aware that their\nparticular broker may not have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and that, therefore,\norders to purchase Shares directly from the\nFund in Creation Units have to be placed by\nthe investor\u0092s broker through an Authorized\nParticipant that has executed a Participant\nAgreement. In such cases there may be\nadditional charges to such investor. At any\ngiven time, there may be only a limited number\nof broker-dealers that have\nexecuted a Participant Agreement and only a\nsmall number of such Authorized Participants\nmay have international capabilities.\n\nOn days when the Exchange\nor the bond markets close earlier than normal,\nthe Fund may require orders to create Creation\nUnits to be placed earlier in the day. In\naddition, if a market or markets on which the\nFund\u0092s investments are primarily traded is\nclosed, the Fund\nwill also generally not accept orders on such\nday(s). Orders must be transmitted by an\nAuthorized Participant by telephone or other\ntransmission method acceptable to the\nDistributor pursuant to procedures set forth\nin the Participant Agreement and\nin accordance with the applicable order form.\nThose placing orders through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to\npermit proper submission of the purchase order\nby the cut-off time. Economic\nor market disruptions or changes, or telephone\nor other communication failure may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or an\nAuthorized Participant.\n\nFund Deposits must be delivered by an\nAuthorized Participant through the Federal\nReserve System (for cash and U.S. government\nsecurities), or through DTC (for\ncorporate securities and municipal\nsecurities), through a subcustody agent (for\nforeign securities) and/or through such other\narrangements allowed by the Trust or its\nagents. With respect to foreign Deposit\nSecurities, the Custodian shall cause the\nsubcustodian of the Fund to maintain an\naccount into which the Authorized Participant\nshall deliver, on behalf of itself or the\nparty on whose behalf it is acting, such\nDeposit Securities. Foreign Deposit Securities\nmust be delivered to an account\nmaintained at the applicable local\nsubcustodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must\nbe ordered by the Authorized Participant in a\ntimely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of\nthe requisite number of Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable,\nto the account of the Fund or its agents by no\nlater than the Settlement Date. The\n\u0093Settlement Date\u0094 for the Fund is generally\nthe second Business Day (\u0093T+2\u0094) after the\nOrder Placement Date. All questions as to the\nnumber of\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be\ndelivered, as applicable, and the validity,\nform and eligibility (including time of\nreceipt) for the deposit of any tendered\nsecurities or cash, as applicable, will be\ndetermined by the Trust, whose\ndetermination shall be final and binding. The\namount of cash represented by the Cash\nComponent must be transferred directly to the\nCustodian through the Federal Reserve Bank\nwire transfer system in a timely manner so as\nto be received by the\nCustodian no later than the Settlement Date.\nIf the Cash Component and the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, are\nnot received in a timely manner by the\nSettlement Date, the creation order may be\ncancelled. Upon written notice to the\nDistributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using a\nFund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect\nthe then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery\nof Creation Units so created generally will\noccur no later than the\nsecond Business Day following the day on which\nthe purchase order is deemed received by the\nDistributor.\n\nThe order shall be deemed to be received on\nthe\nBusiness Day on which the order is placed\nprovided that the order is placed in proper\nform prior to the applicable cut-off time and\nthe federal funds in the appropriate amount\nare deposited by 2:00 p.m. or\n3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions), with the Custodian on the\nSettlement Date. If the order is not placed in\nproper form as required, or federal funds in\nthe appropriate amount are not received by\n2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern\ntime (per applicable instructions) on the\nSettlement Date, then the order may be deemed\nto be rejected and the Authorized Participant\nshall be liable to the Fund for losses, if\nany, resulting therefrom. A creation request\nis considered to be in\n\u0093proper form\u0094 if all procedures set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, order form and this\nSAI are properly followed.\n\nISSUANCE OF A CREATION\nUNIT. Except as provided herein, Creation\nUnits will not be issued until the transfer of\ngood title to the Trust of the Deposit\nSecurities or payment of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the\nsubcustodian has confirmed to the Custodian\nthat the required Deposit Securities (or the\ncash value thereof) have been delivered to the\naccount of the relevant subcustodian or\nsubcustodians, the Principal Underwriter and\nthe Adviser shall be\nnotified of such delivery, and the Trust will\nissue and cause the delivery of the Creation\nUnits.\n\nIn instances where the Trust accepts Deposit\nSecurities\nfor the purchase of a Creation Unit, the\nCreation Unit may be purchased in advance of\nreceipt by the Trust of all or a portion of\nthe applicable Deposit Securities as described\nbelow. In these circumstances, the initial\ndeposit will have a value\ngreater than the net asset value of the Shares\non the date the order is placed in proper form\nsince in addition to available Deposit\nSecurities, cash must be deposited in an\namount equal to the sum of (i) the Cash\nComponent, plus (ii) an\nadditional amount of cash equal to a\npercentage of the market value as set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, of the undelivered\nDeposit Securities (the \u0093Additional Cash\nDeposit\u0094), which shall be maintained in a\ngeneral non-interest bearing collateral\naccount. An additional amount of cash shall be\nrequired to be deposited with the Trust,\npending delivery of the missing Deposit\nSecurities to the extent necessary to maintain\nthe\nAdditional Cash Deposit with the Trust in an\namount at least equal to the applicable\npercentage, as set\n\n40\n\nforth in the Participant Agreement, of the\ndaily marked to market value of the missing\nDeposit Securities. The Trust may use such\nAdditional Cash Deposit to buy the missing\nDeposit Securities at\nany time. Authorized Participants will be\nliable to the Trust for all costs, expenses,\ndividends, income and taxes associated with\nmissing Deposit Securities, including the\ncosts incurred by the Trust in connection with\nany such purchases. These\ncosts will be deemed to include the amount by\nwhich the actual purchase price of the Deposit\nSecurities exceeds the market value of such\nDeposit Securities on the day the purchase\norder was deemed received by the Principal\nUnderwriter plus the\nbrokerage and related transaction costs\nassociated with such purchases. The Trust will\nreturn any unused portion of the Additional\nCash Deposit once all of the missing Deposit\nSecurities have been properly received by the\nCustodian or purchased by\nthe Trust and deposited into the Trust. In\naddition, a transaction fee as set forth below\nunder \u0093Creation Transaction Fees\u0094 will be\ncharged in all cases and an additional\nvariable charge may also be applied. The\ndelivery of Creation Units\nso created generally will occur no later than\nthe Settlement Date.\n\nACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF CREATION UNITS. The\nTrust reserves the absolute right to\nreject an order for Creation Units transmitted\nin respect of the Fund at its discretion,\nincluding, without limitation, if (a) the\norder is not in proper form; (b) the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable,\ndelivered by the\nAuthorized Participant are not as disseminated\nthrough the facilities of the NSCC for that\ndate by the Custodian; (c) the investor(s),\nupon obtaining the Shares ordered, would own\n80% or more of the currently outstanding\nShares of the Fund;\n(d) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would\nhave certain adverse tax consequences to the\nFund; (e) the acceptance of the Fund Deposit\nwould, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful;\n(f) the acceptance of the Fund Deposit would\notherwise, in the discretion of the Trust or\nthe Adviser, have an adverse effect on the\nTrust or the rights of beneficial owners; (g)\nthe acceptance or receipt of the order for a\nCreation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel\nto the Trust, be\nunlawful; or (h) in the event that\ncircumstances outside the control of the\nTrust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent\nand/or the Adviser make it for all practical\npurposes not feasible to process orders for\nCreation Units. Examples of such\ncircumstances include acts of God or public\nservice or utility problems such as fires,\nfloods, extreme weather conditions and power\noutages resulting in telephone, telecopy and\ncomputer failures; market conditions or\nactivities causing trading\nhalts; systems failures involving computer or\nother information systems affecting the Trust,\nthe Principal Underwriter, the Custodian, the\nTransfer Agent, DTC, NSCC, Federal Reserve\nSystem, or any other participant in the\ncreation process, and other\nextraordinary events. The Trust or its agents\nshall communicate to the Authorized\nParticipant its rejection of an order. The\nTrust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and\nthe Principal Underwriter are under no duty,\nhowever, to give notification of\nany defects or irregularities in the delivery\nof Fund Deposits nor shall either of them\nincur any liability for the failure to give\nany such notification. The Trust, the Transfer\nAgent, the Custodian and the Principal\nUnderwriter shall not be liable\nfor the rejection of any purchase order for\nCreation Units.\n\nAll questions as to the number of shares of\neach security in the Deposit Securities and\nthe\nvalidity, form, eligibility and acceptance for\ndeposit of any securities to be delivered\nshall be determined by the Trust, and the\nTrust\u0092s determination shall be final and\nbinding.\n\nREDEMPTION. Shares may be redeemed only in\nCreation Units at their net asset value next\ndetermined after receipt of a redemption\nrequest in proper form by the\nFund through the Transfer Agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE\nFUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN\nAMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors\nmust accumulate enough Shares in the secondary\nmarket to constitute a\nCreation Unit in order to have such Shares\nredeemed by the Trust. There can be no\nassurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the public trading\nmarket at any time to permit assembly of a\nCreation Unit. Investors should expect to\nincur brokerage and other costs in connection\nwith assembling a sufficient number of Shares\nto constitute a redeemable Creation Unit.\n\nWith respect to the\nFund, the Custodian, through the NSCC, makes\navailable prior to the opening of business on\nthe NYSE (currently 9:30 a.m. Eastern time) on\neach Business Day, the list of the names and\nshare quantities of securities designated by\nthe Fund that will be\napplicable (subject to possible amendment or\ncorrection) to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day\n(\u0093Redemption Securities\u0094). Redemption\nSecurities received on redemption may not be\nidentical to Deposit\nSecurities. The identity and number of shares\nof the Redemption Securities or the Cash\nRedemption Amount (defined below) may be\nchanged from time to time with a view to the\ninvestment objective of the Fund.\n\nRedemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are\npaid either in-kind or in cash, or a\ncombination thereof, as determined by\nthe Trust. With respect to in-kind redemptions\nof the Fund, redemption proceeds for a\nCreation Unit will consist of Redemption\nSecurities plus cash in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the net asset\nvalue of the Shares being redeemed, as next\ndetermined after a receipt of a request in\nproper form, and the value of the Redemption\nSecurities (the \u0093Cash Redemption Amount\u0094),\nless a fixed redemption transaction fee and\nany applicable\nadditional variable charge as set forth below.\nIn the event that the Redemption Securities\nhave a value greater than the net asset value\nof the Shares, a compensating cash payment\nequal to the differential is required to be\nmade by or through an\nAuthorized Participant by the redeeming\nshareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at\nthe Trust\u0092s discretion, an Authorized\nParticipant may receive the corresponding cash\nvalue of the securities in lieu of the\nin-kind securities value representing one or\nmore Redemption Securities.\n\n41\n\nPROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS.\nAfter the Trust has deemed an order for\nredemption received, the\nTrust will initiate procedures to transfer the\nrequisite Redemption Securities and the Cash\nRedemption Amount to the Authorized\nParticipant by the Settlement Date. With\nrespect to in-kind redemptions of the\nFund, the calculation of the value of the\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption\nAmount to be delivered upon redemption will be\nmade by the Custodian according to the\nprocedures set forth under \u0093Determination of\nNet Asset Value\u0094,\ncomputed on the Business Day on which a\nredemption order is deemed received by the\nTrust. Therefore, if a redemption order in\nproper form is submitted to the Principal\nUnderwriter by a DTC Participant by the\nspecified time on the Order Placement\nDate, and the requisite number of Shares of\nthe Fund are delivered to the Custodian prior\nto 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per\napplicable instructions) on the Settlement\nDate, then the value of the Redemption\nSecurities and the Cash\nRedemption Amount to be delivered will be\ndetermined by the Custodian on such Order\nPlacement Date. If the requisite number of\nShares of the Fund are not delivered by 2:00\np.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the\nSettlement Date, the Fund will not release the\nunderlying securities for delivery unless\ncollateral is posted in such percentage amount\nof missing Shares as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement (marked to market\ndaily).\n\nWith respect to in-kind redemptions of the\nFund, in connection with taking delivery of\nshares of Redemption Securities\nupon redemption of Creation Units, an\nAuthorized Participant must maintain\nappropriate custody arrangements with a\nqualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody\nproviders in each jurisdiction in which any of\nthe Redemption Securities are\ncustomarily traded (or such other arrangements\nas allowed by the Trust or its agents), to\nwhich account such Redemption Securities will\nbe delivered. Deliveries of redemption\nproceeds generally will be made within two\nBusiness Days of the trade\ndate. Due to the schedule of holidays in\ncertain countries, however, the delivery of\nin-kind redemption proceeds may take longer\nthan two Business Days after the day on which\nthe redemption request is received\nin proper form. If the Authorized Participant\nhas not made appropriate arrangements to take\ndelivery of the Redemption Securities in the\napplicable foreign jurisdiction and it is not\npossible to make other such arrangements, or\nif it is not possible\nto effect deliveries of the Redemption\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, the Trust\nmay, in its discretion, exercise its option to\nredeem such Shares in cash, and the Authorized\nParticipant will be required to receive its\nredemption proceeds in cash.\n\nIf it is not possible to make other such\narrangements, or if it is not possible to\neffect deliveries of the Redemption\nSecurities, the Trust may in its\ndiscretion exercise its option to redeem such\nShares in cash, and the redeeming investor\nwill be required to receive its redemption\nproceeds in cash. In addition, an investor may\nrequest a redemption in cash that the Fund\nmay, in its sole\ndiscretion, permit. In either case, the\ninvestor will receive a cash payment equal to\nthe NAV of its Shares based on the NAV of\nShares of the Fund next determined after the\nredemption request is received in proper form\n(minus a redemption\ntransaction fee and additional charge for\nrequested cash redemptions specified above, to\noffset the Trust\u0092s brokerage and other\ntransaction costs associated with the\ndisposition of Redemption Securities). The\nFund may also, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder,\nprovide such redeemer a portfolio of\nsecurities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Redemption Securities but\ndoes not differ in net asset value.\n\nAn Authorized Participant submitting a\nredemption request is deemed to represent to\nthe Trust that, as of the close of the\nBusiness Day on which the\nredemption request was submitted, it (or its\nclient) will own (within the meaning of Rule\n200 of Regulation SHO) or has arranged to\nborrow for delivery to the Trust on or prior\nto the Settlement Date of the redemption\nrequest, the requisite number\nof Shares of the Fund to be redeemed as a\nCreation Unit. In either case, the Authorized\nParticipant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i)\nit (or its client) has full legal authority\nand legal right to tender for redemption the\nrequisite number of\nShares of the Fund and to receive the entire\nproceeds of the redemption; and (ii) if such\nShares submitted for redemption have been\nloaned or pledged to another party or are the\nsubject of a repurchase agreement, securities\nlending agreement or\nany other arrangement affecting legal or\nbeneficial ownership of such Shares being\ntendered, there are no restrictions precluding\nthe tender and delivery of such Shares\n(including borrowed shares, if any) for\nredemption, free and clear of liens, on\nthe redemption Settlement Date. The Trust\nreserves the right to verify these\nrepresentations at its discretion, but will\ntypically require verification with respect to\na redemption request from the Fund in\nconnection with higher levels of redemption\nactivity and/or short interest in the Fund. If\nthe Authorized Participant, upon receipt of a\nverification request, does not provide\nsufficient verification of its representations\nas determined by the Trust, the redemption\nrequest will not be\nconsidered to have been received in proper\nform and may be rejected by the Trust.\n\nRedemptions of Shares for Redemption\nSecurities will be subject to\ncompliance with applicable federal and state\nsecurities laws and the Fund (whether or not\nit otherwise permits cash redemptions)\nreserves the right to redeem Creation Units\nfor cash to the extent that the Trust could\nnot lawfully deliver specific\nRedemption Securities upon redemptions or\ncould not do so without first registering the\nRedemption Securities under such laws. An\nAuthorized Participant or an investor for\nwhich it is acting subject to a legal\nrestriction with respect to a\nparticular security included in the Redemption\nSecurities applicable to the redemption of\nCreation Units may be paid an equivalent\namount of cash. The Authorized Participant may\nrequest the redeeming investor of the Shares\nto complete an order form\nor to enter into agreements with respect to\nsuch matters as compensating cash payment.\nFurther, an Authorized Participant that is not\na \u0093qualified institutional buyer,\u0094 (\u0093QIB\u0094) as\nsuch term is defined under Rule 144A of the\nSecurities Act, will not be able to receive\nRedemption Securities that are restricted\nsecurities eligible for resale under Rule\n144A. An Authorized Participant may be\nrequired by the Trust to provide a written\nconfirmation with respect to QIB status\nin order to receive Redemption Securities.\n\nThe right of redemption may be suspended or\nthe date of payment postponed with respect to\nthe Fund\n(1) for any period during which the Exchange\nis closed (other than customary weekend and\nholiday closings); (2) for any period during\nwhich trading on the Exchange is suspended or\nrestricted; (3) for any period during which an\nemergency exists as a result of which disposal\nof the Shares of the Fund or determination of\nthe NAV of the Shares is not reasonably\npracticable; or (4) in such other circumstance\nas is permitted by the SEC.\n\n42\n\nREQUIRED EARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as described in\nthe Participant Agreement\nand/or applicable order form, the Fund may\nrequire orders to be placed prior to the trade\ndate, as described in the Participant\nAgreement or the applicable order form, in\norder to receive the trade date\u0092s net asset\nvalue. The cut-off time to receive the trade\ndate\u0092s net asset value will not precede the\ncalculation of the net asset value of the\nFund\u0092s shares on the prior Business Day.\nOrders to purchase shares of such funds that\nare submitted on the Business Day immediately\npreceding a holiday or a day (other than a\nweekend) that the equity markets in the\nrelevant foreign market are closed may not be\naccepted. Authorized Participants may be\nnotified that the cut-off time for an order\nmay be earlier on a particular Business Day,\nas described in the Participant Agreement and\nthe applicable order form.\n\nCREATION AND REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES. A\ntransaction fee, as set forth in the table\nbelow, is imposed for the transfer and other\ntransaction costs\nassociated with the purchase or redemption of\nCreation Units, as applicable. Authorized\nParticipants will be required to pay a fixed\ncreation transaction fee and/or a fixed\nredemption transaction fee, as applicable, on\na given day regardless of the\nnumber of Creation Units created or redeemed\non that day. The Fund may adjust the\ntransaction fee from time to time. An\nadditional charge or a variable charge\n(discussed below) will be applied to certain\ncreation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standard orders and whole or\npartial cash purchases or redemptions. With\nrespect to creation orders, Authorized\nParticipants are responsible for the costs of\ntransferring the securities\nconstituting the Deposit Securities to the\naccount of the Trust and with respect to\nredemption orders, Authorized Participants are\nresponsible for the costs of transferring the\nRedemption Securities from the Trust to their\naccount or on their order.\nInvestors who use the services of a broker or\nother such intermediary may also be charged a\nfee for such services.\n\nCreation and Redemption Transaction Fees:\n                                              \n                                     MAXIMUM  \n                  TRANSACT\u2026       TRANSACTI\u2026  \n  FUND             FEE*,\u00a0**         FEE*,\u00a0**  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  SPDR                                        \n  Bloomberg                                   \n  SASB                                        \n  Corporate    $        500    $       2,000  \n  Bond ESG                                    \n  Select                                      \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n     From time to time, the Fund may waive    \n     all or a portion of its applicable       \n     transaction fee(s).

Expenses and fees,\nincluding the management fees, are accrued\ndaily and taken into account for purposes of\ndetermining net asset\nvalue. The net asset value of the Fund is\ncalculated by State Street and determined once\ndaily as of the close of the regular trading\nsession on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange\nis open. Fixed-income assets\nare generally valued as of the announced\nclosing time for trading in fixed-income\ninstruments in a particular market or\nexchange. Creation/redemption order cut-off\ntimes may be earlier on any day that the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable exchange or market\non which the Fund\u0092s investments are traded)\nannounces an early closing time. Any assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar\nare converted into U.S. dollars at market\nrates on the date of valuation (generally as\nof 4:00 p.m. London time) as quoted by one or\nmore sources.\n\nIn\ncalculating the Fund\u0092s net asset value per\nShare, the Fund\u0092s investments are generally\nvalued using market valuations. A market\nvaluation generally means a valuation (i)\nobtained from an exchange, a pricing service,\nor a major market\nmaker (or dealer), (ii) based on a price\nquotation or other equivalent indication of\nvalue supplied by an exchange, a pricing\nservice, or a major market maker (or dealer)\nor (iii) based on amortized cost. The Fund\nrelies on a third-party\nservice provider for assistance with the daily\ncalculation of the Fund\u0092s NAV. The third-party\nservice provider, in turn, relies on other\nparties for certain pricing data and other\ninputs used in the calculation of the Fund\u0092s\nNAV.\nTherefore, the Fund is subject to certain\noperational risks associated with reliance on\nits service provider and that service\nprovider\u0092s sources of pricing and other data.\nNAV calculation may be adversely affected by\noperational risks arising\nfrom factors such as errors or failures in\nsystems and technology. Such errors or\nfailures may result in inaccurately calculated\nNAVs, delays in the calculation of NAVs and/or\nthe inability to calculate NAV over extended\ntime periods. The Fund may\nbe unable to recover any losses associated\nwith such failures. In the case of shares of\nother funds that are not traded on an\nexchange, a market\n\n43\n\nvaluation means such fund\u0092s published net\nasset value per share. The Adviser may use\nvarious pricing services, or discontinue the\nuse of any pricing service, as approved by the\nBoard from\ntime to time. A price obtained from a pricing\nservice based on such pricing service\u0092s\nvaluation matrix may be considered a market\nvaluation.\n\nIn the\nevent that current market valuations are not\nreadily available or are deemed unreliable,\nthe Trust\u0092s procedures require the Oversight\nCommittee to determine a security\u0092s fair value\nif a market price is not readily available. In\ndetermining\nsuch value the Oversight Committee may\nconsider, among other things, (i) price\ncomparisons among multiple sources, (ii) a\nreview of corporate actions and news events,\nand (iii) a review of relevant financial\nindicators (e.g.,\nmovement in interest rates, market indices,\nand prices from the Fund\u0092s Index Provider). In\nthese cases, the Fund\u0092s net asset value may\nreflect certain portfolio securities\u0092 fair\nvalues rather than their market prices. The\nfair value\nof a portfolio instrument is generally the\nprice which the Fund might reasonably expect\nto receive upon its current sale in an orderly\nmarket between market participants.\nAscertaining fair value requires a\ndetermination of the amount that an\narm\u0092s-length buyer, under the circumstances,\nwould currently pay for the portfolio\ninstrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that\nthe fair value determination for a\nsecurity is materially different than the\nvalue that could be realized upon the sale of\nthe security. In addition, fair value pricing\ncould result in a difference between the\nprices used to calculate the Fund\u0092s net asset\nvalue and the prices\nused by the Fund\u0092s benchmark Index. This may\nresult in a difference between the Fund\u0092s\nperformance and the performance of the Fund\u0092s\nbenchmark Index. With respect to securities\nthat are primarily listed on foreign\nexchanges, the value\nof the Fund\u0092s portfolio securities may change\non days when you will not be able to purchase\nor sell your Shares.\n\nDIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nThe following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled\n\u0093DISTRIBUTIONS.\u0094\n\nGENERAL POLICIES\n\nDividends from\nnet investment income, if any, are generally\ndeclared and paid monthly by the Fund, but may\nvary significantly from period to period.\nDistributions of net realized securities\ngains, if any, generally are declared and paid\nonce a year, but the Trust\nmay make distributions on a more frequent\nbasis for the Fund to improve index tracking\nor to comply with the distribution\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code, in\nall events in a manner consistent with the\nprovisions of the 1940 Act.\n\nDividends and other distributions on Shares\nare distributed, as described below, on a pro\nrata basis to Beneficial Owners of such\nShares. Dividend payments\nare made through DTC Participants and Indirect\nParticipants to Beneficial Owners then of\nrecord with proceeds received from the Trust.\n\nManagement of the\nTrust reserves the right to declare special\ndividends if, in its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or advisable to\npreserve the Fund\u0092s eligibility for treatment\nas a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code or to\navoid imposition of\nincome or excise taxes at the Fund level.\n\nDIVIDEND REINVESTMENT\n\nBroker dealers, at their own discretion, may\noffer a dividend reinvestment service under\nwhich Shares are purchased in the secondary\nmarket at current market\nprices. Investors should consult their broker\ndealer for further information regarding any\ndividend reinvestment service offered by such\nbroker dealer.\n\nTAXES\n\nThe following\nis a summary of certain federal income tax\nconsiderations generally affecting the Fund\nand its shareholders that supplements the\ndiscussion in the Prospectus. No attempt is\nmade to present a comprehensive explanation of\nthe federal, state, local or\nforeign tax treatment of the Fund or its\nshareholders, and the discussion here and in\nthe Prospectus is not intended to be a\nsubstitute for careful tax planning.\n\nThe following general discussion of certain\nfederal income tax consequences is based on\nthe Internal Revenue Code and the regulations\nissued thereunder as in\neffect on the date of this SAI. New\nlegislation, as well as administrative changes\nor court decisions, may significantly change\nthe conclusions expressed herein, and may have\na retroactive effect with respect to the\ntransactions contemplated herein.\n\nThe following information should be read in\nconjunction with the section in the Prospectus\nentitled \u0093ADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION.\u0094\n\n44\n\nTAXATION OF THE FUND. The Fund is treated as a\nseparate corporation for federal income tax\npurposes. The Fund\ntherefore is considered to be a separate\nentity in determining its treatment under the\nrules for RICs described herein and in the\nProspectus. Losses in one series of the Trust\ndo not offset gains in any other series of the\nTrust and the requirements\n(other than certain organizational\nrequirements) for qualifying for treatment as\na RIC are determined at the Fund level rather\nthan at the Trust level. The Fund has elected\nor will elect and intends to qualify each year\nto be treated as a separate\nRIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue\nCode. As such, the Fund should not be subject\nto federal income tax on its net investment\nincome and capital gains, if any, to the\nextent that it timely distributes such income\nand capital gains to its\nshareholders. In order to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC, the Fund must distribute\nannually to its shareholders at least the sum\nof 90% of its taxable net investment income\n(generally including the excess of net short-\nterm capital gains over net\nlong-term capital losses) and 90% of its net\ntax exempt interest income, if any (the\n\u0093Distribution Requirement\u0094) and also must meet\nseveral additional requirements. Among these\nrequirements are the following: (i) at least\n90% of the\nFund\u0092s gross income each taxable year must be\nderived from dividends, interest, payments\nwith respect to certain securities loans,\ngains from the sale or other disposition of\nstock, securities or foreign currencies, or\nother income derived with\nrespect to its business of investing in such\nstock, securities or currencies, and net\nincome derived from interests in qualified\npublicly traded partnerships (the \u0093Qualifying\nIncome Requirement\u0094); and (ii) at the end of\neach quarter\nof the Fund\u0092s taxable year, its assets must be\ndiversified so that (a) at least 50% of the\nmarket value of its total assets must be\nrepresented by cash and cash items, U.S.\ngovernment securities, securities of other\nRICs and other\nsecurities, with such other securities\nlimited, in respect to any one issuer, to an\namount not greater in value than 5% of the\nvalue of the Fund\u0092s total assets and to not\nmore than 10% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of such issuer, and\n(b) not more than 25% of the value of its\ntotal assets is invested in the securities\n(other than U.S. government securities or\nsecurities of other RICs) of any one issuer,\nthe securities (other than securities of other\nRICs) of two or more\nissuers that it controls and that are engaged\nin the same, similar, or related trades or\nbusinesses, or the securities of one or more\nqualified publicly traded partnerships (the\n\u0093Diversification Requirement\u0094).\n\nIf the Fund fails to satisfy the Qualifying\nIncome Requirement or the Diversification\nRequirement in any taxable year, the Fund may\nbe eligible for relief\nprovisions if the failures are due to\nreasonable cause and not willful neglect and\nif a penalty tax is paid with respect to each\nfailure to satisfy the applicable\nrequirements. Additionally, relief is provided\nfor certain de minimis failures\nof the Diversification Requirement where the\nFund corrects the failure within a specified\nperiod of time. In order to be eligible for\nthe relief provisions with respect to a\nfailure to meet the Diversification\nRequirement, the Fund may be required\nto dispose of certain assets. If these relief\nprovisions were not available to the Fund and\nit were to fail to qualify for treatment as a\nRIC for a taxable year, all of its taxable\nincome would be subject to tax at the regular\ncorporate rate without\nany deduction for distributions to\nshareholders, and its distributions (including\ncapital gains distributions) generally would\nbe taxable as ordinary income dividends to its\nshareholders, subject to the dividends-\nreceived deduction for corporate\nshareholders and the lower tax rates on\nqualified dividend income received by\nnoncorporate shareholders. To requalify for\ntreatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable\nyear, the Fund would be required to satisfy\nthe RIC qualification requirements for\nthat year and to distribute any earnings and\nprofits from any year in which the Fund failed\nto qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If the\nFund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, it would\ngenerally be required to\npay a Fund-level tax on certain net built-in\ngains recognized with respect to certain of\nits assets upon a disposition of such assets\nwithin five years of qualifying as a RIC in a\nsubsequent year. The Board\nreserves the right not to maintain the\nqualification of the Fund for treatment as a\nRIC if it determines such course of action to\nbe beneficial to shareholders.\n\nAs discussed more fully below, the Fund\nintends to distribute substantially all of its\nnet investment income and its capital gains\nfor each taxable year.\n\nIf the Fund meets the Distribution Requirement\nbut retains some or all of its income or\ngains, it will be subject to federal income\ntax to the extent any such\nincome or gains are not distributed. The Fund\nmay designate certain amounts retained as\nundistributed net capital gain in a notice to\nits shareholders, who (i) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as\nlong-term capital gain, their proportionate\nshares of the undistributed amount so\ndesignated, (ii) will be entitled to credit\ntheir proportionate shares of the income tax\npaid by the Fund on that undistributed amount\nagainst their federal\nincome tax liabilities and to claim refunds to\nthe extent such credits exceed their\nliabilities and (iii) will be entitled to\nincrease their tax basis, for federal income\ntax purposes, in their Shares by an amount\nequal to the excess of the\namount of undistributed net capital gain\nincluded in their respective income over their\nrespective income tax credits. If the Fund\nfailed to satisfy the Distribution Requirement\nfor any taxable year, it would be taxed as a\nregular corporation, with\nconsequences generally similar to those\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph.\n\nThe Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on\ncertain undistributed income\nif it does not distribute to its shareholders\nin each calendar year an amount at least equal\nto 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar\nyear plus 98.2% of its capital gain net income\nfor the twelve months ended October 31 of such\nyear,\nsubject to an increase for any shortfall in\nthe prior year\u0092s distribution. The Fund\nintends to declare and distribute dividends\nand distributions in the amounts and at the\ntimes necessary to avoid the application of\nthis 4% excise tax.\n\nThe Fund may elect to treat part or all of any\n\u0093qualified late year loss\u0094 as if it had been\nincurred in the succeeding taxable year in\ndetermining\nthe Fund\u0092s taxable income, net capital gain,\nnet short-term capital gain, and earnings and\nprofits. The effect of this election is to\ntreat any such \u0093qualified late year loss\u0094 as\nif it had been incurred in the succeeding\ntaxable year\nin characterizing Fund distributions for any\ncalendar year. A \u0093qualified late year loss\u0094\ngenerally includes net capital loss, net long-\nterm capital loss, or net short-term capital\nloss incurred after October 31 of the current\ntaxable\nyear (commonly referred to as \u0093post-October\nlosses\u0094) and certain other late-year losses.\n\n45\n\nCapital losses in excess of capital gains\n(\u0093net capital losses\u0094) are not permitted to be\ndeducted\nagainst a RIC\u0092s net investment income.\nInstead, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\npotentially subject to certain limitations,\nthe Fund may carry a net capital loss from any\ntaxable year forward indefinitely to offset\nits capital gains, if\nany, in years following the year of the loss.\nTo the extent subsequent capital gains are\noffset by such losses, they will not result in\nU.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund\nand may not be distributed as capital gains to\nits shareholders.\nGenerally, the Fund may not carry forward any\nlosses other than net capital losses.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u0097DISTRIBUTIONS. The\nFund intends to\ndistribute annually to its shareholders\nsubstantially all of its investment company\ntaxable income (computed without regard to the\ndeduction for dividends paid), its net tax-\nexempt income, if any, and any net\ncapital gain (net recognized long-term capital\ngains in excess of net recognized short-term\ncapital losses, taking into account any\ncapital loss carryforwards). The Fund will\nreport to shareholders annually the amounts of\ndividends paid from\nordinary income and the amount of\ndistributions of net capital gain. Since the\nFund primarily holds investments that do not\npay dividends, it is not expected that a\nsubstantial portion (if any) of the dividends\npaid by the Fund will qualify for\neither the dividends-received deduction for\ncorporations or the favorable income tax rates\navailable to individuals on qualified dividend\nincome.\n\nDistributions from the Fund\u0092s net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be taxable to\nshareholders as ordinary income. Distributions\nfrom the\nFund\u0092s net capital gain will be taxable to\nshareholders at long-term capital gains rates,\nregardless of how long shareholders have held\ntheir Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders\nat rates of up to\n20%.\n\nAlthough dividends generally will be treated\nas distributed when paid, any dividend\ndeclared by the Fund in October, November or\nDecember and\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth that is paid during the following\nJanuary will be treated for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes as received by\nshareholders on December 31 of the calendar\nyear in which it was declared.\n\nIf the Fund\u0092s distributions exceed its\nearnings and profits, all or a portion of the\ndistributions made in the taxable year may be\ntreated as a return of\ncapital to shareholders. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not be taxable but\nwill reduce the shareholder\u0092s cost basis and\nresult in a higher capital gain or lower\ncapital loss when the Shares on which the\ndistribution was\nreceived are sold. After a shareholder\u0092s basis\nin the Shares has been reduced to zero,\ndistributions in excess of earnings and\nprofits will be treated as gain from the sale\nof the shareholder\u0092s Shares.\n\nDistributions that are reinvested in\nadditional Shares through the means of a\ndividend reinvestment service, if offered by\nyour broker-dealer, will\nnevertheless be taxable dividends to the same\nextent as if such dividends had been received\nin cash.\n\nA 3.8% Medicare contribution tax generally\napplies\nto all or a portion of the net investment\nincome of a shareholder who is an individual\nand not a nonresident alien for federal income\ntax purposes and who has adjusted gross income\n(subject to certain adjustments) that exceeds\na threshold amount\n($250,000 if married filing jointly or if\nconsidered a \u0093surviving spouse\u0094 for federal\nincome tax purposes, $125,000 if married\nfiling separately, and $200,000 in other\ncases). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a\nportion of the\nundistributed net investment income of certain\nshareholders that are estates and trusts. For\nthese purposes, interest, dividends and\ncertain capital gains (generally including\ncapital gain distributions and capital gains\nrealized on the sale of\nShares) are generally taken into account in\ncomputing a shareholder\u0092s net investment\nincome.\n\nDistributions of ordinary income and capital\ngains may\nalso be subject to foreign, state and local\ntaxes depending on a shareholder\u0092s\ncircumstances.\n\nTAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS \u0096 SALE OF SHARES. In\ngeneral, a sale of Shares results in capital\ngain or loss, and for individual shareholders,\nis taxable at a federal rate dependent upon\nthe length of time the Shares were held. A\nsale of Shares held for a period of one year\nor less at the time of\nsuch sale will, for tax purposes, generally\nresult in short-term capital gains or losses,\nand a sale of those held for more than one\nyear will generally result in long-term\ncapital gains or losses. Long-term capital\ngains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at rates of up to\n20%.\n\nGain or loss on the sale of Shares is measured\nby the difference between the amount received\nand the\nadjusted tax basis of the Shares. Shareholders\nshould keep records of investments made\n(including Shares acquired through\nreinvestment of dividends and distributions)\nso they can compute the tax basis of their\nShares.\n\nA loss realized on a sale of Shares may be\ndisallowed if substantially identical Shares\nare acquired (whether through the reinvestment\nof dividends or\notherwise) within a sixty-one (61) day period\nbeginning thirty (30) days before and ending\nthirty (30) days after the date that the\nShares are disposed of. In such a case, the\nbasis of the\nShares acquired must be adjusted to reflect\nthe disallowed loss. Any loss upon the sale of\nShares held for six (6) months or less will be\ntreated as a long-term capital loss to the\nextent of any amounts treated as distributions\nto the\nshareholder of long-term capital gain\n(including any amounts credited to the\nshareholder as undistributed capital gains).\n\n46\n\nCOST BASIS REPORTING. The cost basis of Shares\nacquired by purchase will generally be based\non the amount paid\nfor the Shares and then may be subsequently\nadjusted for other applicable transactions as\nrequired by the Internal Revenue Code. The\ndifference between the selling price and the\ncost basis of Shares generally determines the\namount of the capital\ngain or loss realized on the sale or exchange\nof Shares. Contact the broker through whom you\npurchased your Shares to obtain information\nwith respect to the available cost basis\nreporting methods and elections for your\naccount.\n\nTAXATION OF FUND INVESTMENTS. Dividends and\ninterest received by the Fund on foreign\nsecurities may give rise to withholding and\nother taxes imposed by\nforeign countries. Tax conventions between\ncertain countries and the United States may\nreduce or eliminate such taxes. The Fund does\nnot expect to satisfy the requirements for\npassing through to its shareholders any share\nof any foreign taxes paid\nby the Fund, with the result that shareholders\nwill not include such taxes in their gross\nincomes and will not be entitled to a tax\ndeduction or credit for such taxes on their\nown returns.\n\nCertain Fund investments may be subject to\ncomplex provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode (including provisions relating to hedging\ntransactions, straddles,\nintegrated transactions, foreign currency\ncontracts, forward foreign currency contracts,\nand notional principal contracts) that, among\nother things, may affect the character of\ngains and losses realized by the Fund (i.e.,\nmay affect whether\ngains or losses are ordinary or capital),\naccelerate recognition of income to the Fund\nand defer losses. These rules could therefore\naffect the character, amount and timing of\ndistributions to shareholders. These\nprovisions also may require the Fund\nto mark-to-market certain types of positions\nin its portfolio (i.e., treat them as if they\nwere closed out) which may cause the Fund to\nrecognize income without\nreceiving cash with which to make\ndistributions to its shareholders in amounts\nnecessary to satisfy the RIC distribution\nrequirements for avoiding income and excise\ntaxes. The Fund intends to monitor its\ntransactions, intends to make appropriate tax\nelections, and intends to make appropriate\nentries in its books and records in order to\nmitigate the effect of these rules and\npreserve the Fund\u0092s qualification for\ntreatment as a RIC.\n\nThe Fund is required for federal income tax\npurposes to mark-to-market and\nrecognize as income for each taxable year its\nnet unrealized gains and losses on certain\nfutures contracts as of the end of the year as\nwell as those actually realized during the\nyear. Gain or loss from futures and options\ncontracts on broad-based\nindexes required to be marked to market will\nbe 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital\ngain or loss. Application of this rule may\nalter the timing and character of\ndistributions to shareholders. The Fund may be\nrequired to defer the recognition of\nlosses on futures contracts, options contracts\nand swaps to the extent of any unrecognized\ngains on offsetting positions held by the\nFund. It is anticipated that certain net gain\nrealized from the closing out of futures or\noptions contracts will be\nconsidered gain from the sale of securities\nand therefore will be qualifying income for\npurposes of the Qualifying Income Requirement.\n\nInvestments by the\nFund in zero coupon or other discount\nsecurities will result in income to the Fund\nequal to a portion of the excess face value of\nthe securities over their issue price (the\n\u0093original issue discount\u0094 or \u0093OID\u0094) each year\nthat the\nsecurities are held, even though the Fund may\nreceive no cash interest payments or may\nreceive cash interest payments that are less\nthan the income recognized for tax purposes.\nIn other circumstances, whether pursuant to\nthe terms of a security or\nas a result of other factors outside the\ncontrol of the Fund, the Fund may recognize\nincome without receiving a commensurate amount\nof cash. Such income is included in\ndetermining the amount of income that the Fund\nmust distribute to maintain its\neligibility for treatment as a RIC and to\navoid the payment of federal income tax,\nincluding the nondeductible 4% excise tax\ndescribed above.\n\nAny market\ndiscount recognized on a market discount bond\nis taxable as ordinary income. A market\ndiscount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue, or below adjusted issue price if issued\nwith original issue discount.\nAbsent an election by the Fund to include the\nmarket discount in income as it accrues, gain\non the Fund\u0092s disposition of such an\nobligation will be treated as ordinary income\nrather than capital gain to the extent of the\naccrued market\ndiscount. Where the income required to be\nrecognized as a result of the OID and/or\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by the Fund, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or\ndispose of securities to enable the Fund\nto make distributions to its shareholders in\norder to qualify for treatment as a RIC and\neliminate taxes at the Fund level.\n\nSpecial rules apply if the\nFund holds inflation-indexed bonds, such as\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities\n(TIPS). Generally, all stated interest on\ninflation-indexed bonds is taken into income\nby the Fund under its regular method of\naccounting for interest income. The\namount of any positive inflation adjustment\nfor a taxable year, which results from an\nincrease in the inflation-adjusted principal\namount of the bond, is treated as OID. The\namount of the Fund\u0092s OID in a taxable year\nwith respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund\u0092s taxable income for such\nyear without a corresponding receipt of cash,\nuntil the bond matures. As a result, the Fund\nmay need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for the\napplicable year. The\namount of any negative inflation adjustments,\nwhich result from a decrease in the inflation-\nadjusted principal amount of the bond, first\nreduces the amount of interest (including\nstated interest, OID, and market discount, if\nany) otherwise\nincludable in the Fund\u0092s taxable income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year; any\nremaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain\ncircumstances, carried forward to reduce the\namount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the\nbond in future taxable years.\n\n47\n\nTAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS. Certain\ntax-exempt shareholders, including qualified\npension plans, individual retirement accounts,\nsalary deferral arrangements, 401(k) plans,\nand other tax-exempt entities,\ngenerally are exempt from federal income\ntaxation except with respect to their\nunrelated business taxable income (\u0093UBTI\u0094).\nUnder current law, the Fund generally serves\nto block UBTI from being realized by its\ntax-exempt shareholders. However,\nnotwithstanding the foregoing, tax-exempt\nshareholders could realize UBTI by virtue of\ntheir investment in the Fund where, for\nexample,\n(i) the Fund invests in REITs that hold\nresidual interests in real estate mortgage\ninvestment conduits (\u0093REMICs\u0094) or (ii) Shares\nconstitute debt-financed property in the hands\nof the\ntax-exempt shareholders within the meaning of\nsection 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCharitable remainder trusts are subject to\nspecial rules and should consult their tax\nadvisors. The IRS has issued\nguidance with respect to these issues and\nprospective shareholders, especially\ncharitable remainder trusts, are strongly\nencouraged to consult with their tax advisors\nregarding these issues.\n\nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions\nwill be subject to a 1.4% tax on net\ninvestment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Shares (among other categories\nof income), are generally taken into account\nin computing a shareholder\u0092s net investment\nincome.\n\nFOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends, other than\ncapital gains dividends, \u0093short-term capital\ngain dividends\u0094 and \u0093interest-related\ndividends\u0094\n(described below), paid by the Fund to\nshareholders who are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities will be subject to a 30%\nUnited States withholding tax unless a reduced\nrate of withholding or a withholding exemption\nis provided under applicable\ntreaty law to the extent derived from\ninvestment income and short-term capital gain\nor unless such income is effectively connected\nwith a U.S. trade or business carried on\nthrough a permanent establishment in the\nUnited States. Nonresident\nshareholders are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning the applicability of\nthe United States withholding tax and the\nproper withholding form(s) to be submitted to\nthe Fund. A non-U.S. shareholder\nwho fails to provide an appropriate IRS Form\nW-8 may be subject to backup withholding at\nthe appropriate rate.\n\nDividends reported by the Fund as (i)\ninterest-related dividends, to the extent such\ndividends are derived from the Fund\u0092s\n\u0093qualified net\ninterest income,\u0094 or (ii) short-term capital\ngain dividends, to the extent such dividends\nare derived from the Fund\u0092s \u0093qualified short-\nterm gain,\u0094 are generally exempt from this 30%\nwithholding tax. \u0093Qualified net\ninterest income\u0094 is the Fund\u0092s net income\nderived from U.S.-source interest and original\nissue discount, subject to certain exceptions\nand limitations. \u0093Qualified short-term gain\u0094\ngenerally means the excess of the Fund\u0092s net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nover its net long-term capital loss, if any.\nIn the case of Shares held through an\nintermediary, the intermediary may withhold\neven if the Fund reports the payment as an\ninterest-related dividend or as a\nshort-term capital gain dividend. Non-U.S.\nshareholders should contact their\nintermediaries with respect to the application\nof these rules to their accounts.\n\nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold\nShares comply with IRS requirements that will\ngenerally require them to\nreport information regarding U.S. persons\ninvesting in, or holding accounts with, such\nentities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to\nFund distributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S. shareholder may be\nexempt from the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement.\n\nBACKUP WITHHOLDING. The Fund will be required\nin certain cases to withhold (as \u0093backup\nwithholding\u0094) on amounts payable to any\nshareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas\nfailed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup\nwithholding will not be applied to payments\nthat have been subject to the 30% withholding\ntax on shareholders who are neither citizens\nnor permanent residents of the U.S.\n\nCREATION UNITS. An Authorized Participant who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units\ngenerally will recognize a gain or a loss. The\ngain or loss will be\nequal to the difference between the market\nvalue of the Creation Units at the time and\nthe sum of the exchanger\u0092s aggregate basis in\nthe securities surrendered plus the amount of\ncash paid for such Creation Units. A person\nwho redeems Creation\nUnits will generally recognize a gain or loss\nequal to the difference between the\nexchanger\u0092s basis in the Creation Units and\nthe sum of the aggregate market value of any\nsecurities received plus the amount of any\ncash received for such\nCreation Units. The IRS, however, may assert\nthat a loss realized upon an exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing\n\u0093wash sales,\u0094 or on the basis that there has\nbeen no significant\nchange in economic position.\n\nAny gain or loss realized upon a creation of\nCreation Units will be treated as capital gain\nor loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the securities exchanged\ntherefor as capital assets, and otherwise will\nbe ordinary income or loss. Similarly, any\ngain or loss realized upon a redemption of\nCreation Units will be treated as capital gain\nor loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Shares comprising the\nCreation Units as capital assets, and\notherwise will be ordinary income or loss. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon the\ncreation of Creation Units will generally be\ntreated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if the securities exchanged for such\nCreation Units have been held for more than\none year, and otherwise will be short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon the redemption of Creation Units\nwill generally be treated\nas long-term capital gain or loss if the\nShares comprising the Creation Units have been\nheld for more than one year, and otherwise,\nwill generally be short-term capital gain or\nloss. Any capital loss realized upon a\nredemption of Creation Units held\nfor six (6) months or less will be treated as\na long-term capital loss to the extent of any\namounts treated as distributions to the\napplicable Authorized Participant of long-term\ncapital gains with respect to the Creation\nUnits (including any\namounts credited to the Authorized Participant\nas undistributed capital gains).\n\n48\n\nThe Fund has the right to reject an order for\nCreation Units if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would,\nupon obtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80%\nor more of the outstanding shares of the Fund\nand if, pursuant to section 351 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, the Fund would have a\nbasis in any deposit securities different from\nthe market value of such\nsecurities on the date of deposit. The Fund\nalso has the right to require information\nnecessary to determine beneficial Share\nownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. If the Fund does issue Creation\nUnits to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding Shares, the purchaser (or a group\nof purchasers) may not recognize gain or loss\nupon the exchange of securities for Creation\nUnits.\n\nPersons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units\nshould consult their own tax advisors with\nrespect to the tax treatment of any creation\nor redemption\ntransaction.\n\nCERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\nUnder promulgated Treasury regulations, if a\nshareholder recognizes a loss on disposition\nof\nthe Fund\u0092s shares of $2 million or more for an\nindividual shareholder or $10 million or more\nfor a corporate shareholder (or certain\ngreater amounts over a combination of years),\nthe shareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure\nstatement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A\nshareholder who fails to make the required\ndisclosure to the IRS may be subject to\nadverse tax consequences, including\nsignificant penalties. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer\u0092s treatment of the\nloss is proper. Shareholders should consult\ntheir tax advisers to determine the\napplicability of these regulations in light of\ntheir individual circumstances.\n\nThe foregoing discussion is a summary only and\nis not intended as a substitute for careful\ntax planning. Purchasers of Shares should\nconsult their own tax\nadvisors as to the tax consequences of\ninvesting in such Shares, including under\nstate, local and other tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date hereof. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur.\n\nCAPITAL STOCK AND SHAREHOLDER REPORTS\n\nThe Fund issues Shares of beneficial interest,\npar value $.01 per Share. The Board may\ndesignate additional funds.\n\nEach Share issued by the Trust has a pro rata\ninterest in the assets of the corresponding\nseries of the Trust. Shares have no\npreemptive, exchange,\nsubscription or conversion rights and are\nfreely transferable. Each Share is entitled to\nparticipate equally in dividends and\ndistributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the Fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of the Fund on\nliquidation.\n\nEach Share has one vote with respect to\nmatters upon which a shareholder vote is\nrequired consistent with the requirements of\nthe 1940 Act\nand the rules promulgated thereunder. Shares\nof all series of the Trust (\u0093Funds\u0094) vote\ntogether as a single class except that if the\nmatter being voted on affects only a\nparticular fund it will be voted on only by\nthat fund and if a matter\naffects a particular fund differently from\nother Funds, that fund will vote separately on\nsuch matter. Under Massachusetts law, the\nTrust is not required to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. The\npolicy of the Trust is not to hold an annual\nmeeting of shareholders unless required to do\nso under the 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights for the election of Trustees.\nUnder Massachusetts\nlaw, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by\nvote of the shareholders.\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, shareholders of a\nbusiness trust may, under certain\ncircumstances, be held personally liable as\npartners for obligations of the Trust.\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an\nexpress disclaimer of shareholder liability\nfor acts or obligations of the Trust, requires\nthat Trust obligations\ninclude such disclaimer, and provides for\nindemnification and reimbursement of expenses\nout of the Trust\u0092s property for any\nshareholder held personally liable for the\nobligations of the Trust. Thus, the risk of a\nshareholder incurring financial\nloss on account of shareholder liability is\nlimited to circumstances in which the Trust\nitself would be unable to meet its\nobligations. Given the above limitations on\nshareholder personal liability, and the nature\nof the Fund\u0092s assets and\noperations, the risk to shareholders of\npersonal liability is believed to be remote.\n\nShareholder inquiries may be made by writing\nto the Trust, c/o the\nDistributor, State Street Global Advisors\nFunds Distributors, LLC at One Iron Street,\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210.\n\n49\n\nCOUNSEL AND INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC\nACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 1111 Pennsylvania\nAvenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, serves as\ncounsel to the Trust. Ernst & Young LLP,\nlocated\nat 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, MA 02116,\nserves as the independent registered public\naccounting firm of the Trust. Ernst & Young\nLLP performs annual audits of the Fund\u0092s\nfinancial statements and provides other audit,\ntax and related\nservices.\n\nLOCAL MARKET HOLIDAY SCHEDULES\n\nThe Trust generally intends to effect\ndeliveries of portfolio securities on a basis\nof \u0093T\u0094 plus two Business Days (i.e., days on\nwhich the NYSE is\nopen)in the relevant foreign market of the\nFund. The ability of the Trust to effect in-\nkind redemptions within two Business Days of\nreceipt of a redemption request is subject to,\namong other things,\nthe condition that, within the time period\nfrom the date of the request to the date of\ndelivery of the securities, there are no days\nthat are local market holidays on the relevant\nBusiness Days. For every occurrence of one or\nmore intervening\nholidays in the local market that are not\nholidays observed in the United States, the\nredemption settlement cycle may be extended by\nthe number of such intervening local holidays.\nIn addition to holidays, other unforeseeable\nclosings in a foreign\nmarket due to emergencies may also prevent the\nTrust from delivering securities within two\nBusiness Days.\n\nThe securities delivery cycles currently\npracticable for transferring portfolio\nsecurities to redeeming investors, coupled\nwith local market holiday schedules, may\nrequire a delivery process longer than the\nstandard settlement period. In certain\ncircumstances during the calendar year, the\nsettlement period may be greater than seven\ncalendar days.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of\nthe date of this SAI and therefore did not\nhave any financial information to report for\nthe Trust\u0092s\nJune 30, 2020 fiscal year end.\n\nSPDRSERRBNDSAI\n\n50\n\nSPDR \u00aeSeries Trust\n\nSPDR \u00aeIndex Shares Funds\n\nSSGA Master Trust\n\nSSGA Active Trust\n\n(each, a \u0093Trust,\u0094 and, collectively, the\n\u0093Trusts\u0094)\n\nPROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES\n\nThe Boards of Trustees of the Trusts have\nadopted the following policy and procedures\nwith respect to voting proxies relating to\nportfolio securities held by\nthe Trusts\u0092 investment portfolios.\n                           \n  1.

As a result,    \n  the integration of our engagement           \n  activities, while leveraging the exercise   \n  of our voting rights, provides a            \n  meaningful shareholder tool that we         \n  believe protects and enhances the           \n  long-term economic value of the holdings    \n  in our client accounts. We maximize our     \n  voting power and engagement by maintaining  \n  a centralized proxy                         \n  voting and active ownership process         \n  covering all holdings, regardless of        \n  strategy. Despite the vast investment       \n  strategies and objectives across State      \n  Street Global Advisors, the fiduciary       \n  responsibilities of share ownership and     \n  voting for which                            \n  State Street Global Advisors has voting     \n  discretion are carried out with a single    \n  voice and objective.                        \n  The Principles support governance           \n  structures that we believe add to, or       \n  maximize shareholder value, for the         \n  companies held in our clients\u0092 portfolios.   \n  We conduct issuer specific engagements      \n  with companies to discuss our               \n  principles, including sustainability        \n  related risks. In addition, we encourage    \n  issuers to find ways to increase the        \n  amount of direct communication board        \n  members have with shareholders. Direct      \n  communication with executive board members  \n  and independent                             \n  non-executive directors is critical to      \n  helping companies understand shareholder    \n  concerns. Conversely, we conduct            \n  collaborative engagement activities with    \n  multiple shareholders and communicate with  \n  company representatives about common        \n  concerns where                              \n  appropriate.                                \n  In conducting our engagements, we also      \n  evaluate the various factors that           \n  influence the corporate governance          \n  framework of a country, including the       \n  macroeconomic conditions and broader        \n  political system, the quality of            \n  regulatory                                  \n  oversight, the enforcement of property and  \n  shareholder rights, and the independence    \n  of the judiciary. We understand that        \n  regulatory requirements and investor        \n  expectations relating to governance         \n  practices and engagement activities differ  \n  from country                                \n  to country. As a result, we engage with     \n  issuers, regulators, or a combination of    \n  the two depending upon the market. We are   \n  also a member of various investor           \n  associations that seek to address broader   \n  corporate governance related policy at the  \n  country                                     \n  level as well as issuer- specific concerns  \n  at a company level.                         \n  The State Street Global Advisors Asset      \n  Stewardship Team may collaborate with       \n  members of the Active Fundamental and       \n  various other investment teams to engage    \n  with companies on corporate governance      \n  issues and to address any specific          \n  concerns. This facilitates our              \n  comprehensive approach to information       \n  gathering as it relates to shareholder      \n  items that are to be voted upon at          \n  upcoming shareholder meetings. We also      \n  conduct issuer-specific engagements with    \n  companies covering various                  \n  corporate governance and sustainability     \n  related topics outside of proxy season.     \n  The Asset Stewardship Team employs a blend  \n  of quantitative and qualitative research,   \n  analysis, and data in order to support      \n  screens that identify issuers where active  \n  engagement may be necessary to protect and  \n  promote shareholder                         \n  value. Issuer engagement may also be event  \n  driven, focusing on issuer-specific         \n  corporate governance, sustainability        \n  concerns, or more broad industry-related    \n  trends. We also consider the size of our    \n  total position of the issuer in question    \n  and/or the                                  \n  potential negative governance, performance  \n  profile, and circumstance at hand. As a     \n  result, we believe issuer engagement can    \n  take many forms and be triggered by         \n  numerous circumstances. The following       \n  approaches represent how we define          \n  engagement                                  \n  methods:                                    \n  Active We use screening tools designed to   \n  capture a mix of company-specific data      \n  including governance and sustainability     \n  profiles to help us focus our voting and    \n  engagement activity. We will actively seek  \n  direct dialogue with                        \n  the board and management of companies that  \n  we have identified through our screening    \n  processes. Such engagements may lead to     \n  further monitoring to ensure that the       \n  company improves its governance or          \n  sustainability practices. In these cases,   \n  the                                         \n  engagement process represents the most      \n  meaningful opportunity for us to protect    \n  long-term shareholder value from excessive  \n  risk due to poor governance and             \n  sustainability practices.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n         Global Proxy Voting and Engagement   \n         Principles                           \n  B-2                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n                        Reactive Reactive     \n                        engagement is         \n                        initiated by the      \n                        issuers.

Thus, we may       \n  withhold votes from board chairs and lead   \n  independent directors who sit on more than  \n  three public company boards, and from       \n  non-executive directors who hold more than  \n  four                                        \n  public company board mandates. We may also  \n  take voting action against named executive  \n  officers who undertake more than two        \n  public board memberships. We also consider  \n  attendance at board meetings and may        \n  withhold votes from directors who attend    \n  less                                        \n  than 75% of board meetings without          \n  appropriate explanation or providing        \n  reason for their failure to meet the        \n  attendance threshold. In addition, we       \n  monitor other factors that may influence    \n  the independence of a                       \n  non-executive director, such as             \n  performance-related pay,                    \n  cross-directorships, significant            \n  shareholdings, and tenure. We support the   \n  annual election of directors and            \n  encourages Australian and New Zealand       \n  companies to adopt this practice.           \n  While we are generally supportive of        \n  having the roles of chairman and CEO        \n  separated in the Australian and New         \n  Zealand markets, we assess the division of  \n  responsibilities between chairman and CEO   \n  on a                                        \n  case-by-case basis, giving consideration    \n  to factors such as company-specific         \n  circumstances, overall level of             \n  independence on the board and general       \n  corporate governance                        \n  standards in the company. Similarly, we     \n  will monitor for circumstances in which a   \n  combined chairman/CEO is appointed or       \n  where a former CEO becomes chairman.        \n  We may also consider board performance and  \n  directors who appear to be remiss in the    \n  performance of their oversight              \n  responsibilities when analyzing their       \n  suitability for reappointment (e.g. fraud,  \n  criminal wrongdoing and breach of           \n  fiduciary responsibilities).                \n  We believe companies should have            \n  committees for audit, remuneration, and     \n  nomination oversight. The audit committee   \n  is responsible for monitoring the           \n  integrity of the financial statements of    \n  the company, appointing external auditors,  \n  monitoring their qualifications and         \n  independence, and their effectiveness and   \n  resource levels. ASX Corporate Governance   \n  Principles requires listed companies to     \n  have an audit committee of at least three   \n  members all of whom are non-executive       \n  directors and a majority of whom are        \n  independent directors. It also requires     \n  that the committee be chaired by an         \n  independent director who is not the chair   \n  of the board. We hold Australian and New    \n  Zealand companies to our global standards   \n  for developed financial markets by          \n  requiring that all members of the audit     \n  committee be independent directors.         \n  In our analysis of boards, we consider      \n  whether board members have adequate skills  \n  to provide effective oversight of           \n  corporate strategy, operations, and risks,  \n  including environmental and social issues.  \n  Boards should also have a                   \n  regular evaluation process in place to      \n  assess the effectiveness of the board and   \n  the skills of board members to address      \n  issues, such as emerging risks, changes to  \n  corporate strategy, and diversification of  \n  operations and geographic footprint. The    \n  nomination committee is responsible for     \n  evaluating and reviewing the balance of     \n  skills, knowledge, and experience of the    \n  board. It also ensures that adequate        \n  succession plans are in place for           \n  directors and the CEO. We may vote against  \n  the re-election of members of the           \n  nomination committee if the board has       \n  failed to address concerns over board       \n  structure or succession.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n          Proxy Voting and Engagement         \n          Guidelines: Australia and New       \n          Zealand                             \n  B-18                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n                        Further, we expect    \n                        boards of ASX 300     \n                        listed companies to   \n                        have at least one     \n                        female board member.  \n                        If a company fails    \n                        to meet this          \n                        expectation, State    \n                        Street Global         \n                        Advisors may vote     \n                        against the Chair of  \n                        the board\u0092s            \n                        nominating            \n                        committee or the      \n                        board leader in the   \n                        absence of a          \n                        nominating            \n                        committee, if         \n                        necessary.            \n                        Additionally, if a    \n                        company fails to      \n                        meet this             \n                        expectation for four  \n                        consecutive years,    \n                        State Street Global   \n                        Advisors may vote     \n                        against all           \n                        incumbent members of  \n                        the                   \n                        nominating            \n                        committee.            \n                        Executive pay is      \n                        another important     \n                        aspect of corporate   \n                        governance.

However, we may take voting        \n  action against the chair or members of the  \n  nominating committee at the STOXX Europe    \n  600 companies that have combined the roles  \n  of                                          \n  chair and CEO and have not appointed an     \n  independent deputy chair or a lead          \n  independent director.                       \n  When voting on the election or re-election  \n  of a director, we also consider the number  \n  of outside board directorships a            \n  non-executive and an executive              \n  may undertake. Thus, we may withhold votes  \n  from board chairs and lead independent      \n  directors who sit on more than three        \n  public company boards, and from             \n  non-executive directors who hold more than  \n  four public                                 \n  company board mandates. We may also take    \n  voting action against named executive       \n  officers who undertake more than two        \n  public board memberships.                   \n  We also consider attendance at board        \n  meetings and may withhold votes from        \n  directors who attend less than 75% of       \n  board meetings without appropriate          \n  explanation or providing reason for their   \n  failure to meet the attendance threshold    \n  .. In addition, we monitor other factors    \n  that may influence the independence of a    \n  non-executive director, such as             \n  performance-related pay,                    \n  cross-directorships and significant         \n  shareholdings. Moreover, we may             \n  vote against the election of a director     \n  whose biographical disclosures are          \n  insufficient to assess his or her role on   \n  the board and/or independence.              \n  Further, we expect boards of STOXX Europe   \n  600 listed companies to have at least one   \n  female board member. If a company fails to  \n  meet this expectation, State Street Global  \n  Advisors may vote against the Chair of the  \n  board\u0092s                                      \n  nominating committee or the board leader    \n  in the absence of a nominating committee,   \n  if necessary.                               \n  Although we generally are in favour of the  \n  annual election of directors, we recognise  \n  that director terms vary considerably in    \n  different European markets. We may vote     \n  against article/bylaw changes that seek to  \n  extend director                             \n  terms. In addition, we may vote against     \n  directors if their terms extend beyond      \n  four years in certain markets.              \n  We believe companies should have relevant   \n  board level committees for audit,           \n  remuneration and nomination oversight. The  \n  audit committee is responsible for          \n  monitoring the integrity of the financial   \n  statements of the company,                  \n  appointing external auditors, monitoring    \n  their qualifications and independence, and  \n  assessing effectiveness and resource        \n  levels. Similarly, executive pay is an      \n  important aspect of corporate governance,   \n  and it should be determined by the board    \n  of                                          \n  directors. We expect companies to have      \n  remuneration committees to provide          \n  independent oversight of executive pay.

Statutory auditors attend board    \n  meetings but do not have voting rights at   \n  the board; however, they have the right to  \n  seek an injunction and conduct broad        \n  investigations of unlawful behavior in the  \n  company\u0092s operations.                        \n  State Street Global Advisors will support   \n  the election of statutory auditors, unless  \n  the outside statutory auditor nominee is    \n  regarded as non-independent based on our    \n  criteria, the outside                       \n  statutory auditor has attended less than    \n  75\u00a0percent of meetings of the board of      \n  directors or board of statutory auditors    \n  during the year under review, or the        \n  statutory auditor has been remiss in the    \n  performance of their oversight              \n  responsibilities (fraud, criminal wrong     \n  doing, and breach of fiduciary              \n  responsibilities).                          \n  For companies with a statutory auditor      \n  structure there is no legal requirement     \n  that boards have outside directors;         \n  however, we believe there should be a       \n  transparent process of independent and      \n  external monitoring of management on        \n  behalf of shareholders.                     \n  \u0095\u2003\u2002\u200aWe believe that boards of TOPIX 500      \n  companies should have at least              \n  three independent directors or be at least  \n  one-third independent, whichever requires   \n  fewer independent directors. Otherwise, we  \n  may oppose the board leader who is          \n  responsible for the director nomination     \n  process.                                    \n  \u0095\u2003\u2002\u200aFor controlled, non-TOPIX                \n  500 companies with a statutory auditor      \n  structure or hybrid structure, we may       \n  oppose the board leader if the board does   \n  not have at least two independent           \n  directors.                                  \n  \u0095 For non-controlled, non-TOPIX 500          \n  companies with                              \n  a statutory auditor structure or hybrid     \n  structure,                                  \n  State Street Global Advisors may oppose     \n  the board                                   \n  leader, if the board does not have at       \n  least two                                   \n  outside directors.                          \n  For companies with a committee structure    \n  or a hybrid board structure, we also take   \n  into consideration the overall              \n  independence level of the committees. In    \n  determining director independence, we       \n  consider the following                      \n  factors:                                    \n  \u0095\u2003\u2002\u200aParticipation in related-party           \n  transactions and other business             \n  relations with the company                  \n  \u0095\u2003\u2002\u200aPast employment with the company         \n  \u0095\u2003\u2002\u200aProfessional services provided to the    \n  company                                     \n  \u0095\u2003\u2002\u200aFamily ties with the company             \n  Regardless of board structure, we may       \n  oppose the                                  \n  election of a director for the following    \n  reasons:                                    \n                                              \n  \u0095\u2003\u2002\u200aFailure to attend board meetings         \n  \u0095\u2003\u2002\u200aIn instances of egregious actions        \n  related to a director\u0092s                      \n  service on the board                        \n  State Street Global Advisors may take       \n  voting                                      \n  action against board members at companies   \n  on the                                      \n  TOPIX 100 that are laggards based on their  \n  R-FactorTM scores2 and cannot articulate    \n  how they                                    \n  plan to improve their score.                \n                                              \n                                              \n          Proxy Voting and Engagement         \n          Guidelines: Japan                   \n  B-35                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n                        Generally, State      \n                        Street Global         \n                        Advisors supports     \n                        proposals to limit    \n                        directors\u0092 and         \n                        statutory auditors\u0092    \n                        liability and/or      \n                        expand                \n                        indemnification and   \n                        liability protection  \n                        up to the limit       \n  Indemnification       provided by law, if   \n  and Limitations on    he or she has not     \n  Liability             acted in bad faith,   \n                        gross negligence, or  \n                        reckless disregard    \n                        of the duties         \n                        involved in the       \n                        conduct of his or     \n                        her office.

Thus, we may withhold votes      \n  from board chairs and lead independent      \n  directors who sit on more than three        \n  public company boards, and from             \n  non-executive directors who hold more than  \n  four public company board mandates. We may  \n  also take voting action against Named       \n  Executive Officers who undertake more than  \n  two public board                            \n  memberships.                                \n  We also consider attendance at board        \n  meetings and may withhold votes from        \n  directors who attend less than 75% of       \n  board meetings in a given year without      \n  appropriate explanation or providing        \n  reason for their failure to meet the        \n  attendance threshold. In addition, we       \n  monitor other factors that may influence    \n  the independence of a non-executive         \n  director, such as performance-related pay,  \n  cross-directorships and significant         \n  shareholdings.                              \n  We support the annual election of           \n  directors.                                  \n  Further, we expect boards of FTSE 350       \n  listed companies to have at least one       \n  female board member. If a company fails to  \n  meet this expectation, State Street Global  \n  Advisors may vote against the chair of the  \n  board\u0092s nominating                           \n  committee or the board leader in the        \n  absence of a nominating committee, if       \n  necessary. Additionally, if a company       \n  fails to meet this expectation for four     \n  consecutive years, State Street Global      \n  Advisors may vote against all incumbent     \n  members of the                              \n  nominating committee.                       \n  While we are generally supportive of        \n  having the roles of chair and CEO           \n  separated in the UK market, we assess the   \n  division of responsibilities between chair  \n  and CEO on a case-by-case basis, giving     \n  consideration to factors such as the        \n  company\u0092s specific circumstances, overall    \n  level of independence on the board and      \n  general corporate governance standards in   \n  the company.                                \n  Similarly, we monitor for circumstances in  \n  which a combined chair/CEO is appointed or  \n  a former CEO becomes chair.                 \n  We may also consider factors such as board  \n  performance and directors who appear to be  \n  remiss in the performance of their          \n  oversight responsibilities when             \n  considering their suitability for           \n  reappointment (e.g. fraud, criminal         \n  wrongdoing and breach of fiduciary          \n  responsibilities).                          \n  We believe companies should have            \n  committees for audit, remuneration and      \n  nomination oversight. The audit committee   \n  is responsible for monitoring the           \n  integrity of the financial statements of    \n  the company, the appointment of external    \n  auditors, auditor qualifications and        \n  independence, and effectiveness and         \n  resource levels. Similarly, executive pay   \n  is an important aspect of corporate         \n  governance, and it should be determined by  \n  the board of directors. We expect           \n  companies to have                           \n  remuneration committees to provide          \n  independent oversight over executive pay.   \n  We will vote against nominees who are       \n  executive members of audit or remuneration  \n  committees.                                 \n  We consider whether board members have      \n  adequate skills to provide effective        \n  oversight of corporate strategy,            \n  operations and risks, including             \n  environmental and social issues. Boards     \n  should also have a regular evaluation       \n  process in                                  \n  place to assess the effectiveness of the    \n  board and the skills of board members to    \n  address issues such as emerging risks,      \n  changes to corporate strategy, and          \n  diversification of operations and           \n  geographic footprint.

For non-hybrid      \n         capital instruments, the \u0091D\u0092 rating    \n         category is used when payments on    \n         an                                   \n         obligation are not made on the date  \n         due, unless S&P Global Ratings       \n         believes that such payments will be  \n         made within any stated grace         \n         period. However, any stated grace    \n  D      period longer than five business     \n         days will be treated as five         \n         business days.                       \n         The \u0091D\u0092 rating also will be used upon  \n         the filing of a bankruptcy petition  \n         or the taking of a similar action    \n         and where default on an obligation   \n         is a virtual certainty, for example  \n         due to automatic stay provisions.
