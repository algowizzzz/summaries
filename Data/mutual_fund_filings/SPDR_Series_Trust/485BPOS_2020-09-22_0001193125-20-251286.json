This table and the Example\nbelow reflect the expenses of the Fund and do\nnot reflect brokerage commissions you may pay\non purchases and sales of Fund Shares. ANNUAL\nFUND OPERATING EXPENSES (expenses that you pay\neach year as a percentage of the value of your\ninvestment):\n\nEXAMPLE: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other mutual funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in\nthe Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes\nthat your investment has a 5% return each year\nand that the Fund's operating expenses remain\nthe same. Although your actual costs may be\nhigher or lower, based on these assumptions\nyour costs would be:\n\nPORTFOLIO TURNOVER: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. The Fund had not commenced\noperations as of the date of this Prospectus\nand, as a result, does not yet have a\nportfolio turnover rate. THE FUND'S PRINCIPAL\nINVESTMENT STRATEGY In seeking to track the\nperformance of the Bloomberg Barclays 3-12\nMonth U.S. Treasury Bill Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a sampling strategy, which\nmeans that the Fund is not required to\npurchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nBased on its analysis of these factors, SSGA\nFunds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents to track the Index, the Fund\nmay invest in debt securities that are not\nincluded in the Index, cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments, such\nas repurchase agreements and money market\nfunds (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser). The Index is designed to measure\nthe performance of public obligations of the\nU.S. Treasury that have a remaining maturity\nof greater than or equal to 3 months and less\nthan 12 months. The Index includes all\npublicly issued U.S. Treasury Bills that have\na remaining maturity of less than 12 months\nand at least 3 months, and are rated\ninvestment-grade. In addition, the securities\nmust be denominated in U.S. dollars and must\nhave a fixed rate. The Index is market\ncapitalization weighted, with securities held\nin the Federal Reserve System Open Market\nAccount deducted from the total amount\noutstanding. Securities in the Index are\nreconstituted and rebalanced on the last\nbusiness day of each month. As of August 31,\n2020, there were approximately 20 securities\nin the Index. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the\nmarket value of the Index. PRINCIPAL RISKS OF\nINVESTING IN THE FUND As with all investments,\nthere are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and\nyou could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other\npublic health issues, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, increases in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk:\nU.S. Treasury obligations may differ from\nother fixed income securities in their\ninterest rates, maturities, times of issuance\nand other characteristics. Similar to other\nissuers, changes to the financial condition or\ncredit rating of the U.S. government may cause\nthe value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per\nshare and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset\nvalue per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. 2 Table of\nContents Income Risk: The Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling interest rates or other\nfactors. Issuers of securities held by the\nFund may call or redeem the securities during\nperiods of falling interest rates, and the\nFund would likely be required to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower interest rates. If an\nobligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in\nother obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk:\nThe Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy.\nThe structure and composition of the Index\nwill affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nWhen there are changes made to the component\nsecurities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities\nholdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its\nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income\ntax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance of the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's return may not match the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, generally as a result\nof cash flows into or out of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held by the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to\nreplicate the Index return by investing in\nfewer than all of the securities in the Index,\nor in some securities not included in the\nIndex, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that\nof the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket or restrictions on resale may limit the\nability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\nsecurities may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet\nredemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in\nany illiquid securities and/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and selling such investments,\nmay be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Low\nShort-Term Interest Rates Risk: During market\nconditions in which short-term interest rates\nare at low levels, the Fund's yield can be\nvery low, and the Fund may have a negative\nyield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). During these conditions, it is\npossible that the Fund will generate an\ninsufficient amount of income to pay its\nexpenses, and will not be able to pay its\nscheduled dividend. In addition, it is\npossible that during these conditions the Fund\nmay experience difficulties purchasing and/or\nselling securities with respect to scheduled\nrebalances, and may, as a result, maintain a\nportion of its assets in cash, on which it may\nearn little, if any, income. Such market\nconditions may adversely affect the Fund's\nability to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index. New Fund Risk: The\nFund is new and there is no assurance that the\nFund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size\nis small, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume, which could lead to wider bid/ask\nspreads. In addition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if the Fund does not\nmeet certain conditions of the listing\nexchange. Any resulting liquidation of the\nFund could cause elevated transaction costs\nfor the Fund and negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Securities Lending Risk: The\nFund may engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the risk that the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. The Fund could also lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided\nfor loaned securities or any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These events could also\ntrigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.\nTo the extent the collateral provided or\ninvestments made with cash collateral differ\nfrom securities included in the Index, such\ncollateral or investments may have a greater\nrisk of loss than the securities included in\nthe Index. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value 3 Table of Contents\nestablished for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby the Fund at that time. FUND PERFORMANCE The\nFund had not commenced operations as of the\ndate of this Prospectus.Once the Fund has\ncompleted a full calendar year of operations,\na bar chart and table will be included that\nwill provide some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing the\nvariability of the Fund's returns based on net\nassets and comparing the Fund's performance to\nthe Index. When available, updated performance\ninformation may be obtained by calling\n1-866-787-2257or visiting the Fund's website:\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Portfolio\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to the Fund.\nPortfolio Managers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Todd Bean, Sean Lussier and April\nBorawski. Todd Bean, CFA, is a Vice President\nof the Adviser and Head of U.S. Traditional\nCash Strategies in the Global Fixed Income,\nCash and Currency Team. He joined the Adviser\nin 2002. Sean Lussier is a Vice President of\nthe Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in\nthe Global Fixed Income, Cash and Currency\nTeam. He joined the Adviser in 2004. April\nBorawski is a Principal of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Fixed Income,\nCash and Currency Team. She joined the Adviser\nin 2015. Purchase and Sale Information The\nFund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of 50,000 Fund Shares known as\n\u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions\nare conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash constituting a\nsubstantial replication, or a representation,\nof the securities included in the Fund's\nbenchmark index at the net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d)\nnext determined after receipt of an order in\nproper form. Creation Unit transactions may be\nmade on any day that the New York Stock\nExchange is open for business. Individual Fund\nShares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc. (the \u201cExchange\u201d), other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at NAV, Fund Shares\nmay trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). Tax\nInformation The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or\ncapital gains, unless you are investing\nthrough a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as\na 401(k) plan or individual retirement\naccount. Any withdrawals made from such tax-\nadvantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your salesperson or\nvisit your financial intermediary's website\nfor more information. 4 Table of Contents\nAdditional Strategies Information Principal\nStrategies General . Please see \u201cThe Fund's\nPrincipal Investment Strategy\u201d section under\n\u201cFund Summary\u201d above for a complete discussion\nof the Fund's principal investment strategies.\nThe Fund may invest in various types of\nsecurities and engage in various investment\ntechniques which are not the principal focus\nof the Fund and therefore are not described in\nthis Prospectus. These securities, techniques\nand practices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain\nfree of charge by contacting shareholder\nservices (see the back cover of this\nProspectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of\nthe Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e.,\nobtain a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex). A number of factors may affect the\nFund's ability to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index, and there can be\nno guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high\ndegree of correlation. For example, the Fund\nmay not be able to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index when there are\npractical difficulties or substantial costs\ninvolved in compiling a portfolio of\nsecurities to follow the Index, when a\nsecurity in the Index becomes temporarily\nilliquid, unavailable or less liquid, or legal\nrestrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from\ninvesting in a security in the Index. The\nAdviser will utilize a sampling strategy in\nmanaging the Fund. Sampling means that the\nAdviser uses quantitative analysis to select\nsecurities, including securities in the Index,\noutside of the Index and derivatives that have\na similar investment profile as the Index in\nterms of key risk factors, performance\nattributes and other economic characteristics.\nThese include industry weightings, market\ncapitalization, and other financial\ncharacteristics of securities. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nIn addition, from time to time, securities are\nadded to or removed from the Index. The\nAdviser may sell securities that are\nrepresented in the Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in the\nIndex, in anticipation of their removal from\nor addition to the Index. Further, the Adviser\nmay choose to overweight securities in the\nIndex, purchase or sell securities not in the\nIndex, or utilize various combinations of\nother available techniques, in seeking to\ntrack the Index. The Fund has adopted a non-\nfundamental investment policy to invest at\nleast 80% of its net assets, plus the amount\nof borrowings for investment purposes, in\ninvestments suggested by its name, measured at\nthe time of investment. The Fund will provide\nshareholders with at least 60 days' notice\nprior to any change in this non-fundamental\n80% investment policy. The Board of Trustees\nof the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change the\nFund's investment strategy, Index and other\npolicies without shareholder approval, except\nas otherwise indicated in this Prospectus or\nin the SAI. The Board may also change the\nFund's investment objective without\nshareholder approval. Non-Principal Strategies\nCertain Other Investments . The Fund may\ninvest in structured notes (notes on which the\namount of principal repayment and interest\npayments are based on the movement of one or\nmore specified factors such as the movement of\na particular security or index), swaps,\noptions and futures contracts. Swaps, options\nand futures contracts and structured notes may\nbe used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to its Index and in managing\ncash flows. Temporary Defensive Positions . In\ncertain situations or market conditions, the\nFund may temporarily depart from its normal\ninvestment policies and strategies, provided\nthat the alternative is consistent with the\nFund's investment objective and is in the best\ninterest of the Fund. For example, the Fund\nmay make larger than normal investments in\nderivatives to maintain exposure to its Index\nif it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . The Fund\nmay borrow money from a bank as permitted by\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or\nother regulatory agency with authority over\nthe Fund, but only for temporary or emergency\npurposes. The Fund may also invest in reverse\nrepurchase agreements, which are considered\nborrowings under the 1940 Act. Although the\n1940 Act presently allows the Fund to borrow\nfrom any bank (including pledging, mortgaging\nor hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33\n1/ 3% of its total assets (not including\ntemporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of\nits total assets), and there is no percentage\nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nunder normal circumstances any borrowings by\nthe Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund's\ntotal assets. 5 Table of Contents Lending of\nSecurities . The Fund may lend its portfolio\nsecurities in an amount not to exceed 40% of\nthe value of its net assets via a securities\nlending program through its securities lending\nagent, State Street Bank and Trust Company\n(\u201cState Street\u201d or the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to\nbrokers, dealers and other financial\ninstitutions desiring to borrow securities to\ncomplete transactions and for other purposes.\nA securities lending program allows the Fund\nto receive a portion of the income generated\nby lending its securities and investing the\nrespective collateral. The Fund will receive\ncollateral for each loaned security which is\nat least equal to the market value of that\nsecurity, marked to market each trading day.\nIn the securities lending program, the\nborrower generally has the right to vote the\nloaned securities; however, the Fund may call\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the Fund's economic interest in the\ninvestment is to be voted upon. Security loans\nmay be terminated at any time by the Fund.\nAdditional Risk Information The following\nsection provides information regarding the\nprincipal risks identified under \u201cPrincipal\nRisks of Investing in the Fund\u201d in the Fund\nSummary along with additional risk\ninformation. Principal Risks Credit Risk .\nCredit risk is the risk that an issuer,\nguarantor or liquidity provider of a fixed-\nincome security held by the Fund may be unable\nor unwilling, or may be perceived (whether by\nmarket participants, ratings agencies, pricing\nservices or otherwise) as unable or unwilling,\nto make timely principal and/or interest\npayments, or to otherwise honor its\nobligations. It includes the risk that the\nsecurity will be downgraded by a credit rating\nagency; generally, lower credit quality\nissuers present higher credit risks. An actual\nor perceived decline in creditworthiness of an\nissuer of a fixed-income security held by the\nFund may result in a decrease in the value of\nthe security. It is possible that the ability\nof an issuer to meet its obligations will\ndecline substantially during the period when\nthe Fund owns securities of the issuer or that\nthe issuer will default on its obligations or\nthat the obligations of the issuer will be\nlimited or restructured. The credit rating\nassigned to any particular investment does not\nnecessarily reflect the issuer's current\nfinancial condition and does not reflect an\nassessment of an investment's volatility or\nliquidity. Securities rated in the lowest\ncategory of investment-grade are considered to\nhave speculative characteristics. If a\nsecurity held by the Fund loses its rating or\nits rating is downgraded, the Fund may\nnonetheless continue to hold the security in\nthe discretion of the Adviser. In the case of\nasset-backed or mortgage-related securities,\nchanges in the actual or perceived ability of\nthe obligors on the underlying assets or\nmortgages to make payments of interest and/or\nprincipal may affect the values of those\nsecurities. Debt Securities Risk . The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, increases in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, a\ndecline in the Fund's income and yield, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk . The net\nasset value of Fund Shares will generally\nfluctuate with changes in the market value of\nthe Fund's securities holdings. The market\nprices of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate\nin accordance with changes in the Fund's net\nasset value and supply and demand of Fund\nShares on the Exchange. It cannot be predicted\nwhether Fund Shares will trade below, at or\nabove their net asset value. Price differences\nmay be due, in large part, to the fact that\nsupply and demand forces at work in the\nsecondary trading market for Fund Shares will\nbe closely related to, but not identical to,\nthe same forces influencing 6 Table of\nContents the prices of the securities of the\nIndex trading individually or in the aggregate\nat any point in time. The market prices of\nFund Shares may deviate significantly from the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares during periods\nof market volatility. However, given that Fund\nShares can be created and redeemed in Creation\nUnits (unlike shares of many closed-end funds,\nwhich frequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at premiums to,\ntheir net asset value), the Adviser believes\nthat large discounts or premiums to the net\nasset value of Fund Shares should not be\nsustained over long periods. While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to\nmake it likely that Fund Shares normally will\ntrade close to the Fund's net asset value,\ndisruptions to creations and redemptions or\nmarket volatility may result in trading prices\nthat differ significantly from the Fund's net\nasset value. If an investor purchases Fund\nShares at a time when the market price is at a\npremium to the net asset value of Fund Shares\nor sells at a time when the market price is at\na discount to the net asset value of Fund\nShares, then the investor may sustain losses.\nIncome Risk. The Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors.\nIssuers of securities held by the Fund may\ncall or redeem the securities during periods\nof falling interest rates, and the Fund would\nlikely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation\nheld by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates. A\nreduction in the income earned by the Fund may\nlimit the Fund's ability to achieve its\nobjective. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk . The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of\nsecurities. The Fund will seek to replicate\nIndex returns, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the\nactual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. The Fund generally will buy and will\nnot sell a security included in the Index as\nlong as the security is part of the Index\nregardless of any sudden or material decline\nin value or foreseeable material decline in\nvalue of the security, even though the Adviser\nmay make a different investment decision for\nother actively managed accounts or portfolios\nthat hold the security. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio managed using an active\ninvestment strategy. The structure and\ncomposition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index\n(in absolute terms and by comparison with\nother indices) and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to\ntime and may not be identified and corrected\nby the Index Provider for a period of time or\nat all, which may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund and its shareholders. While the\nAdviser seeks to track the performance of the\nIndex (i.e., achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index for a\nnumber of reasons. For example, the return on\nthe sample of securities purchased by the Fund\n(or the return on securities not included in\nthe Index) to replicate the performance of the\nIndex may not correlate precisely with the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, either as a result of\ncash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves\nof cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may attempt to replicate the Index\nreturn by investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the\nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes\nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact the Fund's\nability to match the return of the Index. The\nAdviser may apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or\ninvestment techniques to refine or limit the\nnumber or types of issuers included in the\nIndex in which the Fund may invest.\nApplication of such screens or techniques may\nresult in investment performance below that of\nthe Index and may not produce results expected\nby the Adviser. Index tracking risk may be\nheightened during times of increased market\nvolatility or other unusual market conditions.\nPursuant to the Index methodology, a security\nmay be removed from the Index in the event\nthat it does not comply with the eligibility\nrequirements of the Index. As a result, the\nFund may be forced to sell securities at\ninopportune times and/or unfavorable prices\ndue to these changes in the Index components.\nWhen there are changes made to the component\nsecurities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio to\nattempt to increase the correlation between\nthe Fund's portfolio and the Index, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnscheduled changes to the Index may expose\nthe Fund to additional tracking error risk.\nThe Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities\nholdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its\nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income\ntax consequences. 7 Table of Contents Interest\nRate Risk . Interest rate risk is the risk\nthat the securities held by the Fund will\ndecline in value because of increases in\nmarket interest rates. Duration is a measure\nused to determine the sensitivity of a\nsecurity's price to changes in interest rates.\nDebt securities with longer durations tend to\nbe more sensitive to changes in interest\nrates, usually making them more volatile than\ndebt securities with shorter durations. For\nexample, the value of a security with a\nduration of five years would be expected to\ndecrease by 5% for every 1% increase in\ninterest rates. Falling interest rates also\ncreate the potential for a decline in the\nFund's income and yield. Interest-only and\nprincipal-only securities are especially\nsensitive to interest rate changes, which can\naffect not only their prices but can also\nchange the income flows and repayment\nassumptions about those investments. Variable\nand floating rate securities also generally\nincrease or decrease in value in response to\nchanges in interest rates, although generally\nto a lesser degree than fixed-rate securities.\nA substantial increase in interest rates may\nalso have an adverse impact on the liquidity\nof a security, especially those with longer\ndurations. Interest rate changes can be sudden\nand unpredictable, and are influenced by a\nnumber of factors, including government\npolicy, monetary policy, inflation\nexpectations, perceptions of risk, and supply\nand demand for bonds. Changes in government or\ncentral bank policy, including changes in tax\npolicy or changes in a central bank's\nimplementation of specific policy goals, may\nhave a substantial impact on interest rates.\nThis could lead to heightened levels of\ninterest rate, volatility and liquidity risks\nfor the fixed income markets generally and\ncould have a substantial and immediate effect\non the values of the Fund's investments. There\ncan be no guarantee that any particular\ngovernment or central bank policy will be\ncontinued, discontinued or changed, nor that\nany such policy will have the desired effect\non interest rates. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity\nrisk is the risk that the Fund may not be able\nto dispose of securities or close out\nderivatives transactions readily at a\nfavorable time or prices (or at all) or at\nprices approximating those at which the Fund\ncurrently values them. For example, certain\ninvestments may be subject to restrictions on\nresale, may trade in the over-the-counter\nmarket or in limited volume, or may not have\nan active trading market. Illiquid securities\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for the Fund to value illiquid\nsecurities accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. Disposal of illiquid\nsecurities may entail registration expenses\nand other transaction costs that are higher\nthan those for liquid securities. The Fund may\nseek to borrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of\nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing\nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund.\nLow Short-Term Interest Rates Risk . During\nmarket conditions in which short-term interest\nrates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can\nbe very low, and the Fund may have a negative\nyield (i.e. , it may lose money on an\noperating basis). During these conditions, it\nis possible that the Fund will generate an\ninsufficient amount of income to pay its\nexpenses, and will not be able to pay its\nscheduled dividend. In addition, it is\npossible that during these conditions the Fund\nmay experience difficulties purchasing and/or\nselling securities with respect to scheduled\nrebalances, and may, as a result, maintain a\nportion of its assets in cash, on which it may\nearn little, if any, income. Such market\nconditions may adversely affect the Fund's\nability to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index. Market Risk .\nMarket prices of investments held by the Fund\nwill go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile,\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in\nthe Fund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities\nprices. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. An outbreak of a respiratory\ndisease caused by a novel coronavirus (known\nas COVID-19) first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has resulted in a global\npandemic and major disruptions to economies\nand markets around the world, including the\nUnited States. Financial markets have\nexperienced extreme volatility and severe\nlosses, and trading in many instruments has\nbeen disrupted. Liquidity for many instruments\nhas been greatly reduced for periods of time.\nSome interest rates are very low and in some\ncases yields are negative. Governments and\ncentral banks, including the Federal Reserve\nin the United States, have taken extraordinary\nand unprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal 8 Table of Contents economies and the\nfinancial markets. The impact of these\nmeasures, and whether they will be effective\nto mitigate the economic and market\ndisruption, will not be known for some time.\nIn addition, the outbreak of COVID-19, and\nmeasures taken to mitigate its effects, could\nresult in disruptions to the services provided\nto the Fund by its service providers. New Fund\nRisk . The Fund is new and there is no\nassurance that the Fund will grow quickly.\nWhen the Fund's size is small, the Fund may\nexperience low trading volume, which could\nlead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted\nif the Fund does not meet certain conditions\nof the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could cause elevated\ntransaction costs for the Fund and negative\ntax consequences for its shareholders.\nReinvestment Risk. Income from the Fund's\nportfolio may decline when the Fund invests\nthe proceeds from investment income, sales of\nportfolio securities or matured, traded or\ncalled debt obligations. For instance, during\nperiods of declining interest rates, an issuer\nof debt obligations may exercise an option to\nredeem securities prior to maturity, forcing\nthe Fund to reinvest the proceeds in lower-\nyielding securities. A decline in income\nreceived by the Fund from its investments is\nlikely to have a negative effect on the yield\nand total return of the Fund Shares.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend\nportfolio securities in an amount not to\nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the\nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by the\nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a\nloan transaction, as compensation for lending\nits securities, the Fund will receive a\nportion of the dividends or interest accrued\non the securities held as collateral or, in\nthe case of cash collateral, a portion of the\nincome from the investment of such cash. In\naddition, the Fund will receive the amount of\nall dividends, interest and other\ndistributions on the loaned securities.\nHowever, the borrower has the right to vote\nthe loaned securities. The Fund will call\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the investment is to be voted upon.\nEfforts to recall such securities promptly may\nbe unsuccessful, especially for foreign\nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and\nmay involve expenses to the Fund. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a\ntimely manner or at all. Should the borrower\nof the securities fail financially, the Fund\nmay experience delays in recovering the\nsecurities or exercising its rights in the\ncollateral. Loans are made only to borrowers\nthat are deemed by the securities lending\nagent to be of good financial standing. In a\nloan transaction, the Fund will also bear the\nrisk of any decline in value of securities\nprovided as collateral or acquired with cash\ncollateral. The Fund will attempt to minimize\nthis risk by limiting the investment of cash\ncollateral to high quality instruments of\nshort maturity either directly on behalf of\nthe lending Fund or through one or more joint\naccounts or funds, which may include those\nmanaged by the Adviser. To the extent the\ncollateral provided or investments made with\ncash collateral differ from securities\nincluded in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss\nthan the securities included in the Index. In\naddition, the Fund will be subject to the risk\nthat any income generated by lending its\nsecurities or reinvesting cash collateral is\nlower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay\na borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute\npayments for dividends when overseeing the\nFund's securities lending activity. U.S.\nTreasury Obligations Risk . U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other fixed income\nsecurities in their interest rates,\nmaturities, times of issuance and other\ncharacteristics. Similar to other issuers,\nchanges to the financial condition or credit\nrating of the U.S. government may cause the\nvalue of the Fund\u2018s U.S. Treasury obligations\nto decline. The total public debt of the\nUnited States as a percentage of gross\ndomestic product has grown rapidly since the\nbeginning of the recent financial downturn.\nAlthough high debt levels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic problems, they may\ncreate certain systemic risks if sound debt\nmanagement practices are not implemented. A\nhigh national debt level may increase market\npressures to meet government funding needs,\nwhich may drive debt cost higher and cause a\ncountry to sell additional debt, thereby\nincreasing refinancing risk. A high national\ndebt also raises concerns that a government\nwill not be able to make principal or interest\npayments when they are due. In the worst case,\nunsustainable debt levels can cause a decline\nin the value of the dollar (which may lead to\ninflation), and can prevent the U.S.\ngovernment from implementing effective\ncounter-cyclical fiscal policy in economic\ndownturns. U.S. Treasury securities are\ncurrently given the top rating by all major\nratings agencies except Standard & Poor's\nRatings Services, which rates them AA+, one\ngrade below their top rating. Since\ndowngrading U.S. Treasury securities from AAA\nto AA+ in 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings\nServices has affirmed its rating. A downgrade\nof the ratings of U.S. government debt\nobligations, such as U.S. Treasury\nobligations, which are often used as a\nbenchmark for other 9 Table of Contents\nborrowing arrangements, could result in higher\ninterest rates for individual and corporate\nborrowers, cause disruptions in the\ninternational bond markets and have a\nsubstantial negative effect on the U.S.\neconomy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities from another ratings agency or a\nfurther downgrade below AA+ rating by Standard\n& Poor's Ratings Services may cause the value\nof the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to\ndecline. Valuation Risk . Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. Technological issues or other service\ndisruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause the Fund to value\nits investments incorrectly. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the\nvalue established for it at any time, and it\nis possible that the Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby the Fund at that time. Non-Principal Risks\nAuthorized Participants, Market Makers and\nLiquidity Providers Concentration Risk. The\nFund has a limited number of financial\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized\nParticipants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are responsible\nfor the creation and redemption activity for\nthe Fund. In addition, there may be a limited\nnumber of market makers and/or liquidity\nproviders in the marketplace. To the extent\neither of the following events occur, Fund\nShares may trade at a material discount to NAV\nand possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit the\nbusiness or otherwise become unable to process\ncreation and/or redemption orders and no other\nAPs step forward to perform these services, or\n(ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers\nexit the business or significantly reduce\ntheir business activities and no other\nentities step forward to perform their\nfunctions. Cash Transaction Risk . To the\nextent that the Fund sells portfolio\nsecurities to meet some or all of a redemption\nrequest with cash, the Fund may incur taxable\ngains or losses that it might not have\nincurred had it made redemptions entirely in-\nkind. As a result, the Fund may pay out higher\nannual capital gain distributions than if the\nin-kind redemption process was used. Conflicts\nof Interest Risk. An investment in the Fund\nwill be subject to a number of actual or\npotential conflicts of interest. For example,\nthe Adviser or its affiliates may provide\nservices to the Fund, such as securities\nlending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting\nservices, transfer agency and shareholder\nservicing, securities brokerage services, and\nother services for which the Fund would\ncompensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates.\nThe Fund may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise\naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no\nassurance that the rates at which the Fund\npays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its\naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters\ninto transactions with the Adviser or its\naffiliates will be the most favorable\navailable in the market generally or as\nfavorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of the\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements. The Adviser and its\naffiliates serve as investment adviser to\nother clients and may make investment\ndecisions that may be different from those\nthat will be made by the Adviser on behalf of\nthe Fund. For example, the Adviser may provide\nasset allocation advice to some clients that\nmay include a recommendation to invest in or\nredeem from particular issuers while not\nproviding that same recommendation to all\nclients invested in the same or similar\nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to\npurchase (or sell) investments for the Fund\nand to sell (or purchase) the same investment\nfor accounts, funds, or structured products\nfor which it serves as asset manager, or for\nother clients or affiliates. The Adviser and\nits affiliates may invest for clients in\nvarious securities that are senior, pari\npassuor junior to, or have interests different\nfrom or adverse to, the securities that are\nowned by the Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material\nnonpublic confidential information that may\nrestrict the Adviser from purchasing\nsecurities or selling securities for itself or\nits clients (including the Fund) or otherwise\nusing such information for the benefit of its\nclients or itself. 10 Table of Contents The\nforegoing does not purport to be a\ncomprehensive list or complete explanation of\nall potential conflicts of interests which may\naffect the Fund. The Fund may encounter\ncircumstances, or enter into transactions, in\nwhich conflicts of interest that are not\nlisted or discussed above may arise. Costs of\nBuying and Selling Shares . Investors buying\nor selling Fund Shares in the secondary market\nwill pay brokerage commissions or other\ncharges imposed by brokers, as determined by\nthat broker. Brokerage commissions are often a\nfixed amount and may be a significant\nproportional cost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell relatively small amounts of Fund\nShares. In addition, secondary market\ninvestors will also incur the cost of the\ndifference between the price that an investor\nis willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d\nprice) and the price at which an investor is\nwilling to sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price).\nThis difference in bid and ask prices is often\nreferred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask\nspread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time\nfor Fund Shares based on trading volume and\nmarket liquidity, and is generally lower if\nFund Shares have more trading volume and\nmarket liquidity and higher if Fund Shares\nhave little trading volume and market\nliquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask\nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,\nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may\nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Counterparty Risk. The Fund\nwill be subject to credit risk with respect to\nthe counterparties with which the Fund enters\ninto derivatives contracts and other\ntransactions such as repurchase agreements or\nreverse repurchase agreements. The Fund's\nability to profit from these types of\ninvestments and transactions will depend on\nthe willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund may be unable to\nterminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. The Fund may experience\nsignificant delays in obtaining any recovery\nin an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any\ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in\nsuch circumstances. If the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by its counterparty, it may\nbe delayed or prevented from realizing on the\ncollateral in the event of a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if the Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another institution being\nsubstituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, the\nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the\nfinancial institution's authority, the\nfinancial institution's liabilities could be\nwritten down, eliminated or converted into\nequity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial\ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of securities and, if the Fund\nholds such securities or has entered into a\ntransaction with such a financial security\nwhen a bail-in occurs, the Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, funds (such as the Fund) and their\nservice providers (including the Adviser) may\nbe prone to operational and information\nsecurity risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. In general,\ncyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects.\nCyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from\naccessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns of, the Fund, the\nAdviser or a custodian, transfer agent, or\nother affiliated or third-party service\nprovider may adversely affect the Fund or its\nshareholders. For instance, cyber-attacks or\ntechnical malfunctions may interfere with the\nprocessing of shareholder or other\ntransactions, affect the Fund's ability to\ncalculate its NAV, cause the release of\nprivate shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject the\nFund to regulatory fines, penalties or\nfinancial losses, reimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and additional compliance\ncosts. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions\nmay render records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund\nShares, and other data integral to the\nfunctioning of the Fund inaccessible or\ninaccurate or incomplete. The Fund may also\nincur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents\nin the future. The Fund and its shareholders\ncould be negatively impacted as a result.\nWhile the Adviser has established a business\ncontinuity plan and systems designed to\nminimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the\nuse of technology, processes 11 Table of\nContents and controls, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, given the evolving\nnature of this threat. The Fund relies on\nthird-party service providers for many of its\nday-to-day operations, and will be subject to\nthe risk that the protections and protocols\nimplemented by those service providers will be\nineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-\nattack. The Adviser does not control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems put in place\nby third-party service providers, and such\nthird-party service providers may have limited\nindemnification obligations to the Adviser or\nthe Fund. Similar types of cybersecurity risks\nor technical malfunctions also are present for\nissuers of securities in which the Fund\ninvests, which could result in material\nadverse consequences for such issuers, and may\ncause the Fund's investment in such securities\nto lose value. Derivatives Risk. A derivative\nis a financial contract the value of which\ndepends on, or is derived from, the value of\nan underlying asset, interest rate, or index.\nDerivative transactions typically involve\nleverage and may have significant volatility.\nIt is possible that a derivative transaction\nwill result in a loss greater than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may\nnot be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price.\nRisks associated with derivative instruments\ninclude potential changes in value in response\nto interest rate changes or other market\ndevelopments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential\nfor the derivative transaction not to have the\neffect the Adviser anticipated or a different\nor less favorable effect than the Adviser\nanticipated; the failure of the counterparty\nto the derivative transaction to perform its\nobligations under the transaction or to settle\na trade; possible mispricing or improper\nvaluation of the derivative instrument;\nimperfect correlation in the value of a\nderivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that the\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that the Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including without\nlimitation absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to\nthe Fund due to losses on the transaction and\nan increase in volatility; the potential for\nthe derivative transaction to have the effect\nof accelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. Index\nConstruction Risk . A security included in the\nIndex may not exhibit the characteristic or\nprovide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently the Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that\ncharacteristic or exposure. Index Licensing\nRisk . It is possible that the license under\nwhich the Adviser or the Fund is permitted to\nreplicate or otherwise use the Index will be\nterminated or may be disputed, impaired or\ncease to remain in effect. In such a case, the\nAdviser may be required to replace the Index\nwith another index which it considers to be\nappropriate in light of the investment\nstrategy of the Fund. The use of any such\nsubstitute index may have an adverse impact on\nthe Fund's performance. In the event that the\nAdviser is unable to identify a suitable\nreplacement for the Index, it may determine to\nterminate the Fund. Money Market Risk . An\ninvestment in a money market fund is not a\ndeposit of any bank and is not insured or\nguaranteed by the FDIC or any other government\nagency. Certain money market funds seek to\npreserve the value of their shares at $1.00\nper share, although there can be no assurance\nthat they will do so, and it is possible to\nlose money by investing in such a money market\nfund. A major or unexpected change in interest\nrates or a decline in the credit quality of an\nissuer or entity providing credit support, an\ninactive trading market for money market\ninstruments, or adverse market, economic,\nindustry, political, regulatory, geopolitical,\nand other conditions could cause the share\nprice of such a money market fund to fall\nbelow $1.00. It is possible that such a money\nmarket fund will issue and redeem shares at\n$1.00 per share at times when the fair value\nof the money market fund's portfolio per share\nis more or less than $1.00. None of State\nStreet Corporation, State Street Bank and\nTrust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d), State Street\nGlobal Advisors, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or\ntheir affiliates (\u201cState Street Entities\u201d)\nguarantee the value of an investment in a\nmoney market fund at $1.00 per share.\nInvestors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market\nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV\nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the\nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be 12 Table of\nContents\n\nworth more or less than their original\npurchase price. Recent changes in the\nregulation of money market funds may affect\nthe operations and structures of money market\nfunds. A money market fund may be permitted or\nrequired to impose redemption fees or to\nimpose limitations on redemptions during\nperiods of high illiquidity in the markets for\nthe investments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . The Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to the Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nhave the effect of reducing the Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. The Fund may engage in frequent\ntrading of its portfolio securities in\nconnection with Index rebalancing. Frequent\ntrading may cause the Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent trading. Trading Issues\n. Although Fund Shares are listed for trading\non the Exchange and may be listed or traded on\nU.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than\nthe Exchange, there can be no assurance that\nan active trading market for the Fund Shares\nwill develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange may be halted due to\nmarket conditions or for reasons that, in the\nview of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange is subject to\ntrading halts caused by extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit\nbreaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock\nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While the Fund expects that the\nability of Authorized Participants to create\nand redeem Fund Shares at net asset value\nshould be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of the Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund and, subject to\nthe oversight of the Board, is responsible for\nthe investment management of the Fund. The\nAdviser provides an investment management\nprogram for the Fund and manages the\ninvestment of the Fund's assets. The Adviser\nis a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nGlobal Advisors, Inc., which itself is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation. The Adviser is registered with\nthe SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940, as amended. The Adviser and certain\nother affiliates of State Street Corporation\nmake up SSGA. SSGA is one of the world's\nlargest institutional money managers and the\ninvestment management arm of State Street\nCorporation. As of June 30, 2020, the Adviser\nmanaged approximately $612.89 billion in\nassets and SSGA managed approximately $3.05\ntrillion in assets. The Adviser's principal\nbusiness address is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. For the services provided\nto the Fund under the Investment Advisory\nAgreement, the Fund expects to pay the Adviser\nthe annual fee based on a percentage of the\nFund's average daily net assets as set forth\nbelow:\n                                              \n  SPDR\u00a0Bloomberg Barclays 3-12       0.1345%  \n  Month T-Bill\u00a0ETF                            \n                                              \nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all\nor a portion of its management fee. The\nAdviser has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fee and/or reimburse\nexpenses in an amount equal to any acquired\nfund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in\nacquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) for each Fund until October 31, 2021.\nThis waiver and/or reimbursement does not\nprovide for the recoupment by the Adviser of\nany amounts waived or reimbursed. This waiver\nand/or reimbursement may not be terminated\nprior to October 31, 2021 except with the\napproval of the Board. The Adviser pays all\nexpenses of the Fund other than the management\nfee, brokerage expenses, taxes, interest, fees\nand expenses of the Independent Trustees\n(including any Trustee's counsel fees),\nlitigation expenses, acquired fund fees and\nexpenses and other extraordinary expenses. A\nsummary of the factors considered by the Board\nin connection with the initial approval of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwill be available in the Fund's semi-annual\nreport for the period ended December 31, 2020.\n\n13\n\nTable of Contents SSGA FM, as the investment\nadviser for the Fund, may hire one or more\nsub-advisers to oversee the day-to-day\ninvestment activities of the Fund. The sub-\nadvisers are subject to oversight by the\nAdviser. The Adviser and SPDR Series Trust\n(the \u201cTrust\u201d) have received an exemptive order\nfrom the SEC that permits the Adviser, with\nthe approval of the Independent Trustees of\nthe Trust, to retain and amend existing sub-\nadvisory agreements with unaffiliated\ninvestment sub-advisers for the Fund without\nsubmitting the sub-advisory agreement to a\nvote of the Fund's shareholders. The Trust\nwill notify shareholders in the event of any\nchange in the identity of such sub-adviser or\nsub-advisers. The Adviser has ultimate\nresponsibility for the investment performance\nof the Fund due to its responsibility to\noversee each sub-adviser and recommend their\nhiring, termination and replacement. The\nAdviser is not required to disclose fees paid\nto any unaffiliated sub-adviser retained\npursuant to the order. Portfolio Managers.\nThe Adviser manages the Fund using a team of\ninvestment professionals. The team approach is\nused to create an environment that encourages\nthe flow of investment ideas. The portfolio\nmanagers within the team work together in a\ncohesive manner to develop and enhance\ntechniques that drive the investment process\nfor the investment strategy. This approach\nrequires portfolio managers to share a variety\nof responsibilities including investment\nstrategy and analysis while retaining\nresponsibility for the implementation of the\nstrategy within any particular portfolio. The\napproach also enables the team to draw upon\nthe resources of other groups within SSGA. The\nportfolio management team is overseen by the\nSSGA Investment Committee. The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Todd Bean, Sean\nLussier and April Borawski. Todd Bean, CFA, is\na Vice President of SSGA and the Adviser and\nHead of U.S. Traditional Cash Strategies in\nthe Global Fixed Income, Cash and Currency\nTeam.

Additional\nPurchase and Sale Information Fund Shares are\nlisted for secondary trading on the Exchange\nand individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold in the secondary market\nthrough a broker-dealer. The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The\nExchange may close early on the business day\nbefore certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules\nare subject to change without notice. If you\nbuy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you will pay the secondary market\nprice for Fund Shares. In addition, you may\nincur customary brokerage commissions and\ncharges and may pay some or all of the spread\nbetween the bid and the offered price in the\nsecondary market on each leg of a round trip\n(purchase and sale) transaction. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares will fluctuate\ncontinuously throughout trading hours based on\nmarket supply and demand rather than the\nFund's net asset value, which is calculated at\nthe end of each business day. Fund Shares will\ntrade on the Exchange at prices that may be\nabove ( i.e., at a premium) or below ( i.e.,\nat a discount), to varying degrees, the daily\nnet asset value of Fund Shares. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares may deviate\nsignificantly from the Fund's net asset value\nduring periods of market volatility. Given,\nhowever, that Fund Shares can be issued and\nredeemed daily in Creation Units, the Adviser\nbelieves that large discounts and premiums to\nnet asset value should not be sustained over\nlong periods. Information showing the number\nof days the market price of Fund Shares was\ngreater than the Fund's net asset value and\nthe number of days it was less than the Fund's\nnet asset value (i.e., premium or discount)\nfor various time periods is available by\nvisiting the Fund's website at\nhttps://www.spdrs.com. 16 Table of Contents\nThe Exchange will disseminate, every fifteen\nseconds during the regular trading day, an\nindicative optimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d)\nrelating to the Fund. The IOPV calculations\nare estimates of the value of the Fund's net\nasset value per Fund Share. Premiums and\ndiscounts between the IOPV and the market\nprice may occur. This should not be viewed as\na \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset value\nper Fund Share. The IOPV is based on the\ncurrent market value of the published basket\nof portfolio securities and/or cash required\nto be deposited in exchange for a Creation\nUnit and does not necessarily reflect the\nprecise composition of the Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. When applicable, the\nIOPV price is based on quotes and closing\nprices from the securities' local market\nconverted into U.S. dollars at the current\ncurrency rates and may not reflect events that\noccur subsequent to the local market's close.\nTherefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best\npossible valuation of the Fund's current\nportfolio. Neither the Fund nor the Adviser or\nany of their affiliates are involved in, or\nresponsible for, the calculation or\ndissemination of such IOPVs and make no\nwarranty as to their accuracy. The Fund does\nnot impose any restrictions on the frequency\nof purchases and redemptions; however, the\nFund reserves the right to reject or limit\npurchases at any time as described in the SAI.\nWhen considering that no restriction or policy\nwas necessary, the Board evaluated the risks\nposed by market timing activities, such as\nwhether frequent purchases and redemptions\nwould interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of the Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause the Fund\nto experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional\nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and\nredeemed only in large quantities of shares\nknown as Creation Units, available only from\nthe Fund directly, and that most trading in\nthe Fund occurs on the Exchange at prevailing\nmarket prices and does not involve the Fund\ndirectly. Given this structure, the Board\ndetermined that it is unlikely that (a) market\ntiming would be attempted by the Fund's\nshareholders or (b) any attempts to market\ntime the Fund by shareholders would result in\nnegative impact to the Fund or its\nshareholders. Distributions Dividends and\nCapital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are\nentitled to your share of the Fund's income\nand net realized gains on its investments. The\nFund pays out substantially all of its net\nearnings to its shareholders as\n\u201cdistributions.\u201d The Fund may earn interest\nfrom debt securities and, if participating,\nsecurities lending income. The Fund will\ngenerally realize short-term capital gains or\nlosses whenever it sells or exchanges assets\nheld for one year or less. Net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be treated as\nordinary income when distributed to\nshareholders. The Fund will generally realize\nlong-term capital gains or losses whenever it\nsells or exchanges assets held for more than\none year. Net capital gains (the excess of the\nFund's net long-term capital gains over its\nnet short-term capital losses) are distributed\nto shareholders as \u201ccapital gain\ndistributions.\u201d Income dividend distributions,\nif any, are generally distributed to\nshareholders monthly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Net\ncapital gains for the Fund are distributed at\nleast annually. Dividends may be declared and\npaid more frequently or at any other time to\nimprove Index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nA portion of each distribution may result in a\nreturn of capital. You will be notified\nregarding the portion of the distribution\nwhich represents a return of capital.\nDistributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares\nonly if the broker through whom you purchased\nFund Shares makes such option available.\nDistributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as\nif such distributions had not been reinvested.\nPortfolio Holdings Disclosure The Fund's\nportfolio holdings disclosure policy is\ndescribed in the SAI. In addition, the\nidentities and quantities of the securities\nheld by the Fund are disclosed on the Fund's\nwebsite. 17 Table of Contents Additional Tax\nInformation The following discussion is a\nsummary of some important U.S. federal income\ntax considerations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in the Fund. Your investment in the\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes On Distributions.\nIn general, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in the\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from\nthe Fund will generally be taxed as ordinary\nincome. Any distributions of the Fund's net\ncapital gains are taxable as long-term capital\ngain regardless of how long you have owned\nFund Shares. Long-term capital gains are\ngenerally taxed to noncorporate shareholders\nat rates of up to 20%. Distributions in excess\nof the Fund's current and accumulated earnings\nand profits are treated as a tax-free return\nof capital to the extent of your basis in the\nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital\ngain thereafter. Since the Fund primarily\nholds investments that do not pay dividends,\nit is not expected that a substantial portion\n(if any) of the dividends paid by the Fund\nwill qualify for either the dividends-received\ndeduction for corporations or the favorable\nincome tax rates available to individuals on\nqualified dividend income. U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding specified thresholds are\nsubject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on\nall or a portion of their \u201cnet investment\nincome,\u201d which includes taxable interest,\ndividends and certain capital gains (generally\nincluding capital gain distributions and\ncapital gains realized upon the sale of Fund\nShares). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or\na portion of the undistributed net investment\nincome of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. Certain tax-exempt\neducational institutions will be subject to a\n1.4% tax on net investment income. For these\npurposes, certain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. Distributions paid in\nJanuary, but declared by the Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year,\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth, may be taxable to you in the calendar\nyear in which they were declared. The Fund\nwill inform you of the amount of your ordinary\nincome dividends, capital gain distributions\nand any qualified dividend income shortly\nafter the close of each calendar year. A\ndistribution will reduce the Fund's net asset\nvalue per Fund Share and may be taxable to you\nas ordinary income or capital gain even\nthough, from an investment standpoint, the\ndistribution may constitute a return of\ncapital. Original Issue Discount . Investments\nby the Fund in zero coupon or other discount\nsecurities will result in income to the Fund\nequal to a portion of the excess face value of\nthe securities over their issue price (the\n\u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or \u201cOID\u201d) each year\nthat the securities are held, even though the\nFund may receive no cash interest payments or\nmay receive cash interest payments that are\nless than the income recognized for tax\npurposes. In other circumstances, whether\npursuant to the terms of a security or as a\nresult of other factors outside the control of\nthe Fund, the Fund may recognize income\nwithout receiving a commensurate amount of\ncash. The Fund\u2018s share of such income is\nincluded in determining the amount that the\nFund must distribute to maintain its\neligibility for treatment as a regulated\ninvestment company and to avoid the payment of\nfederal tax, including the nondeductible 4%\nexcise tax. Because any income required to be\nrecognized as a result of the OID and/or\nmarket discount rules (discussed below) may\nnot be matched by a corresponding cash\npayment, the Fund may be required to borrow\nmoney or dispose of securities to be able to\nmake distributions to its shareholders in\norder to qualify for treatment as a regulated\ninvestment company and eliminate taxes at the\nFund level. Inflation-Indexed Bonds. Special\nrules apply if the Fund holds inflation-\nindexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest\non inflation-indexed bonds is taken into\nincome by the Fund under its regular method of\naccounting for interest income. The amount of\nany positive inflation adjustment for a\ntaxable year, which results from an increase\nin the inflation-adjusted principal amount of\nthe bond, is treated as OID. The amount of the\nFund's OID in a taxable year with respect to a\nbond will increase the Fund's taxable income\nfor such year without a corresponding receipt\nof cash until the bond matures. As a result,\nthe Fund may need to use other sources of cash\nto satisfy its distribution requirements for\nsuch year. The amount of any negative\ninflation adjustments, which result from a\ndecrease in the inflation-adjusted principal\namount of the bond, first reduces the amount\nof interest (including stated interest, OID,\nand market discount, if any) 18 Table of\nContents otherwise includible in the Fund's\nincome with respect to the bond for the\ntaxable year; any remaining negative\nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary\nloss or, in certain circumstances, carried\nforward to reduce the amount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the\nbond in future taxable years. Market Discount.\nAny market discount recognized on a market\ndiscount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or below adjusted issue price if the\nbond was issued with original issue discount.\nAbsent an election by the Fund to include the\nmarket discount in income as it accrues, the\ngain on the Fund's disposition of such an\nobligation will be treated as ordinary income\nrather than capital gain to the extent of the\naccrued market discount. Where the income\nrequired to be recognized as a result of the\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash payment, the Fund may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand eliminate taxes at the Fund level,\npotentially resulting in additional taxable\ngain or loss to the Fund. Derivatives and\nOther Complex Securities. The Fund may invest\nin complex securities. These investments may\nbe subject to numerous special and complex\nrules. These rules could affect whether gains\nand losses recognized by the Fund are treated\nas ordinary income or capital gain, accelerate\nthe recognition of income to the Fund and/or\ndefer the Fund's ability to recognize losses.\nIn turn, these rules may affect the amount,\ntiming or character of the income distributed\nto you by the Fund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding the application\nof these rules. Foreign Currency Transactions.\nThe Fund's transactions in foreign currencies,\nforeign currency denominated debt obligations\nand certain foreign currency options, futures\ncontracts and forward contracts (and similar\ninstruments) may give rise to ordinary income\nor loss to the extent such income or loss\nresults from fluctuations in the value of the\nforeign currency concerned. Taxes on Exchange-\nListed Share Sales. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon a sale of Fund Shares is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if Fund Shares have been held for more\nthan one year and as short-term capital gain\nor loss if Fund Shares have been held for one\nyear or less, except that any capital loss on\nthe sale of Fund Shares held for six months or\nless is treated as long-term capital loss to\nthe extent that capital gain dividends were\npaid with respect to the Fund Shares. Taxes on\nCreations and Redemptions of Creation Units. A\nperson who exchanges securities for Creation\nUnits generally will recognize a gain or loss.\nThe gain or loss will be equal to the\ndifference between the market value of the\nCreation Units at the time and the exchanger's\naggregate basis in the securities surrendered\nplus any cash paid for the Creation Units. A\nperson who exchanges Creation Units for\nsecurities will generally recognize a gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the\nexchanger's basis in the Creation Units and\nthe aggregate market value of the securities\nand the amount of cash received. The Internal\nRevenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), however, may\nassert that a loss realized upon an exchange\nof securities for Creation Units cannot be\ndeducted currently under the rules governing\n\u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the basis that there has\nbeen no significant change in economic\nposition. Persons exchanging securities should\nconsult their own tax advisor with respect to\nwhether wash sale rules apply and when a loss\nmight be deductible. Under current federal tax\nlaws, any capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if the Fund Shares (or securities\nsurrendered) have been held for more than one\nyear and as a short-term capital gain or loss\nif the Fund Shares (or securities surrendered)\nhave been held for one year or less. If you\ncreate or redeem Creation Units, you will be\nsent a confirmation statement showing how many\nFund Shares you purchased or sold and at what\nprice. The Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has\nthe right to reject an order for Creation\nUnits if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund and if,\npursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the Fund\nwould have a basis in the securities different\nfrom the market value of the securities on the\ndate of deposit. The Trust also has the right\nto require information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser\n(or group of purchasers) will not recognize\ngain or loss upon the exchange of securities\nfor Creation Units. 19 Table of Contents If\nthe Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it\nmay bear additional costs and recognize more\ncapital gains than it would if it redeems\nCreation Units in-kind. Non-U.S. Investors.\nOrdinary income dividends paid by the Fund to\nshareholders who are non-resident aliens or\nforeign entities will generally be subject to\na 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than\ndistributions reported by the Fund as\ninterest-related dividends and short-term\ncapital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty\nrate applies or unless such income is\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, the Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of\nits net income derived from U.S. source\ninterest, and the Fund may report short-term\ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains\non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a trade or business within the\nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax\nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of the\nFund's shares are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment. Unless certain\nnon-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply\nwith IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding\nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions payable to such\nentities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt\nfrom the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement. Backup Withholding. The Fund will\nbe required in certain cases to withhold (as\n\u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts payable to\nany shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States.\nCertain Potential Tax Reporting Requirements.\nUnder U.S. Treasury regulations, if a\nshareholder recognizes a loss of $2 million or\nmore for an individual shareholder or $10\nmillion or more for a corporate shareholder\n(or certain greater amounts over a combination\nof years), the shareholder must file with the\nIRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886.\nDirect shareholders of portfolio securities\nare in many cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance\nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted.\nSignificant penalties may be imposed for the\nfailure to comply with the reporting\nrequirements. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer's treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisors\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances. Other Tax Issues. The Fund may\nbe subject to tax in certain states where the\nFund does business (or is treated as doing\nbusiness as a result of its investments).\nFurthermore, in those states which have income\ntax laws, the tax treatment of the Fund and of\nFund shareholders with respect to\ndistributions by the Fund may differ from\nfederal tax treatment. The foregoing\ndiscussion summarizes some of the consequences\nunder current federal income tax law of an\ninvestment in the Fund. It is not a substitute\nfor personal tax advice. Consult your personal\ntax advisor about the potential tax\nconsequences of an investment in the Fund\nunder all applicable tax laws. General\nInformation The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nIf shareholders of the Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled\nto one vote for each Fund Share they own.\nAnnual meetings of shareholders will not be\nheld except as required by the 1940 Act and\nother applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization The\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. 20 Table of Contents For\npurposes of the 1940 Act, Fund Shares are\nissued by the respective series of the Trust\nand the acquisition of Fund Shares by\ninvestment companies is subject to the\nrestrictions of Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940\nAct. The Trust has received exemptive relief\nfrom Section 12(d)(1) to allow registered\ninvestment companies to invest in the Fund\nbeyond the limits set forth in Section\n12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions as set forth in an SEC exemptive\norder issued to the Trust, including that such\ninvestment companies enter into an agreement\nwith the Trust. From time to time, the Fund\nmay advertise yield and total return figures.\nYield is a historical measure of dividend\nincome, and total return is a measure of past\ndividend income (assuming that it has been\nreinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither\nyield nor total return should be used to\npredict the future performance of the Fund.\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel\nto the Trust, including the Fund. Ernst &\nYoung LLP serves as the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and will audit the\nFund's financial statements annually.\nPremium/Discount Information The Fund had not\ncommenced operations prior to the date of this\nProspectus and therefore does not have\ninformation regarding how often Fund Shares\ntraded on the Exchange at a price above (\ni.e., at a premium) or below ( i.e., at a\ndiscount) the net asset value of the Fund\nduring the past calendar year.

The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998.\nThe offering of the Fund\u2019s shares (\u201cShares\u201d)\nis registered under the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The\ninvestment objective of the Fund is to provide\ninvestment results that, before fees and\nexpenses, correspond generally to the price\nand yield performance of a specified market\nindex (the \u201cIndex\u201d). SSGA Funds Management,\nInc. serves as the investment adviser for the\nFund (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d). The Fund\noffers and issues Shares at its net asset\nvalue (sometimes referred to herein as \u201cNAV\u201d)\nonly in aggregations of a specified number of\nShares (each, a \u201cCreation Unit\u201d). The Fund\ngenerally offers and issues Shares either in\nexchange for (i) a basket of securities\nincluded in its Index (\u201cDeposit Securities\u201d)\ntogether with the deposit of a specified cash\npayment (\u201cCash Component\u201d) or (ii) a cash\npayment equal in value to the Deposit\nSecurities (\u201cDeposit Cash\u201d) together with the\nCash Component. The primary consideration\naccepted by the Fund ( i.e., Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash) is set forth under\n\u201cPurchase and Redemption of Creation Units\u201d\nlater in this SAI. The Trust reserves the\nright to permit or require the substitution of\na \u201ccash in lieu\u201d amount to be added to the\nCash Component to replace any Deposit Security\nand reserves the right to permit or require\nthe substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu\nof Deposit Cash (subject to applicable legal\nrequirements). The Shares have been approved\nfor listing and secondary trading on a\nnational securities exchange (the \u201cExchange\u201d).\nThe Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nmarket prices. These prices may differ from\nthe Shares\u2019 net asset values. The Shares are\nalso redeemable only in Creation Unit\naggregations, and generally in exchange either\nfor (i) portfolio securities and a specified\ncash payment or (ii) cash (subject to\napplicable legal requirements). A Creation\nUnit of the Fund consists of 50,000 Shares.\nShares may be issued in advance of receipt of\nDeposit Securities subject to various\nconditions including a requirement to maintain\non deposit with the Trust cash at least equal\nto a specified percentage of the market value\nof the missing Deposit Securities, as set\nforth in the Participant Agreement (as defined\nbelow). See \u201cPurchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units.\u201d The Trust may impose a\ntransaction fee for each creation or\nredemption. In all cases, such fees will be\nlimited in accordance with the requirements of\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) applicable to management investment\ncompanies offering redeemable securities. In\naddition to the fixed creation or redemption\ntransaction fee, an additional transaction fee\nof up to three times the fixed creation or\nredemption transaction fee and/or an\nadditional variable charge may apply.\nINVESTMENT POLICIES The Fund may invest in the\nfollowing types of investments, consistent\nwith its investment strategies and objective.\nPlease see the Fund\u2019s Prospectus for\nadditional information regarding its principal\ninvestment strategies. DIVERSIFICATION STATUS\nThe Fund is classified as a \u201cdiversified\u201d\ninvestment company under the 1940 Act. Under\nthe 1940 Act, a diversified investment\ncompany, as to 75% of its total assets, may\nnot purchase securities of any issuer (other\nthan securities issued or guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, its agents or\ninstrumentalities or securities of other\ninvestment companies) if, as a result, more\nthan 5% of its total assets would be invested\nin the securities of such issuer, or more than\n10% of the issuer\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities would be held by the investment\ncompany. The Fund seeks to track the\nperformance of its Index. The composition of\nthe Index may fluctuate between diversified\nand non-diversifiedsolely due to changes in\nweightings of one or more Index components. As\na result, the Fund\u2019s diversification status\nalso may fluctuate between diversified and\nnon-diversifieddepending on the composition\nof, and to approximately the same extent as,\nits Index. A \u201cnon-diversified\u201dclassification\nmeans that a fund is not limited by the 1940\nAct with regard to the percentage of its\nassets that may be invested in the securities\nof a single issuer. This means that a non-\ndiversifiedfund may invest a greater portion\nof its assets in the securities of a single\nissuer than a diversified fund. To the extent\nthe Fund becomes non-diversifieddue solely to\nchanges in the composition of its Index, it\nwill not seek shareholder approval if and when\nthe Fund shifts from diversified to non-\ndiversified. The Fund intends to maintain the\nrequired level of diversification and\notherwise conduct its operations so as to\nqualify as a \u201cregulated investment company\u201d\n(\u201cRIC\u201d) for purposes of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cInternal\nRevenue Code\u201d), and to relieve the Fund of any\nliability for federal income tax to the extent\nthat its earnings are distributed to\nshareholders. Compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of the Internal\nRevenue Code may severely limit the investment\nflexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment\nobjective. 3 Table of Contents BONDS A bond is\nan interest-bearing security issued by a\ncompany, governmental unit or, in some cases,\na non-U.S.entity. The issuer of a bond has a\ncontractual obligation to pay interest at a\nstated rate on specific dates and to repay\nprincipal (the bond\u2019s face value) periodically\nor on a specified maturity date; provided,\nhowever, a zero coupon bond pays no interest\nto its holder during its life. The value of a\nzero coupon bond to the Fund consists of the\ndifference between such bond\u2019s face value at\nthe time of maturity and the price for which\nit was acquired, which may be an amount\nsignificantly less than its face value\n(sometimes referred to as a \u201cdeep discount\u201d\nprice). An issuer may have the right to redeem\nor \u201ccall\u201d a bond before maturity, in which\ncase the investor may have to reinvest the\nproceeds at lower market rates. Most bonds\nbear interest income at a \u201ccoupon\u201d rate that\nis fixed for the life of the bond. The value\nof a fixed rate bond usually rises when market\ninterest rates fall, and falls when market\ninterest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed rate\nbond\u2019s yield (income as a percent of the\nbond\u2019s current value) may differ from its\ncoupon rate as its value rises or falls. Fixed\nrate bonds generally are also subject to\ninflation risk, which is the risk that the\nvalue of the bond or income from the bond will\nbe worth less in the future as inflation\ndecreases the value of money. This could mean\nthat, as inflation increases, the \u201creal\u201d value\nof the assets of the Fund holding fixed rate\nbonds can decline, as can the value of the\nFund\u2019s distributions. Other types of bonds\nbear income at an interest rate that is\nadjusted periodically. Because of their\nadjustable interest rates, the value of\n\u201cfloating-rate\u201d or \u201cvariable-rate\u201d bonds\nfluctuates much less in response to market\ninterest rate movements than the value of\nfixed rate bonds. The Fund may treat some of\nthese bonds as having a shorter maturity for\npurposes of calculating the weighted average\nmaturity of its investment portfolio. Bonds\nmay be senior or subordinated obligations.\nSenior obligations generally have the first\nclaim on a corporation\u2019s earnings and assets\nand, in the event of liquidation, are paid\nbefore subordinated obligations. Bonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer\u2019s general\ncreditworthiness) or secured (also backed by\nspecified collateral). The investment return\nof corporate bonds reflects interest on the\nbond and changes in the market value of the\nbond. The market value of a corporate bond may\nbe affected by the credit rating of the\ncorporation, the corporation\u2019s performance and\nperceptions of the corporation in the market\nplace. There is a risk that the issuers of the\nsecurities may not be able to meet their\nobligations on interest or principal payments\nat the time called for by such a security.\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER Commercial paper consists of\nshort-term, promissory notes issued by banks,\ncorporations and other entities to finance\nshort-term credit needs. These securities\ngenerally are discounted but sometimes may be\ninterest bearing. CONCENTRATION The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments in securities of\nissuers in the same industry as may be\nnecessary to approximate the composition of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying Index. The securities of\nissuers in particular industries may dominate\nthe benchmark Index of the Fund and\nconsequently the Fund\u2019s investment portfolio.\nThis may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance or subject its Shares to greater\nprice volatility than that experienced by less\nconcentrated investment companies. The Trust\u2019s\ngeneral policy is to exclude securities of the\nU.S. government and its agencies or\ninstrumentalities when measuring industry\nconcentration. In pursuing its objective, the\nFund may hold the securities of a single\nissuer in an amount exceeding 10% of the\nmarket value of the outstanding securities of\nthe issuer, subject to restrictions imposed by\nthe Internal Revenue Code. In particular, as\nthe Fund\u2019s size grows and its assets increase,\nit will be more likely to hold more than 10%\nof the securities of a single issuer if the\nissuer has a relatively small public float as\ncompared to other components in its benchmark\nIndex. FUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAP\nAGREEMENTS The Fund may invest up to 20% of\nits assets in derivatives, including exchange-\ntraded futures on Treasuries or Eurodollars,\nU.S. exchange-traded or OTC put and call\noptions contracts and exchange-traded or OTC\nswap transactions (including NDFs interest\nrate swaps, total return swaps, excess return\nswaps, and credit default swaps). The Fund\nwill segregate cash and/or appropriate liquid\nassets if required to do so by SEC or CFTC\nregulation or interpretation. Recent\nlegislation calls for new regulation of the\nderivatives markets. The extent and impact of\nthe regulation is not yet fully known and may\nnot be for some time. New regulations could\nadversely affect the value, availability and\nperformance of certain derivative instruments,\nmay make them more costly, and may limit or\nrestrict their use by the Fund. 4 Table of\nContents Futures contracts generally provide\nfor the future sale by one party and purchase\nby another party of a specified commodity or\nsecurity at a specified future time and at a\nspecified price. Index futures contracts are\nsettled daily with a payment by one party to\nthe other of a cash amount based on the\ndifference between the level of the index\nspecified in the contract from one day to the\nnext. A futures contract on an index is an\nagreement pursuant to which two parties agree\nto take or make delivery of an amount of cash\nequal to the difference between the value of\nthe index at the close of the last trading day\nof the contract and the price at which the\nindex contract originally was written.\nAlthough the value of an index might be a\nfunction of the value of certain specified\nsecurities, physical delivery of these\nsecurities is not always made. A public market\nexists in futures contracts covering a number\nof indexes, as well as financial instruments,\nincluding, without limitation: U.S. Treasury\nbonds; U.S. Treasury notes; GNMA Certificates;\nthree-month U.S. Treasury bills;\n90-daycommercial paper; bank certificates of\ndeposit; Eurodollar certificates of deposit;\nthe Australian Dollar; the Canadian Dollar;\nthe British Pound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss\nFranc; the Mexican Peso; and certain\nmultinational currencies, such as the Euro. It\nis expected that other futures contracts will\nbe developed and traded in the future. Futures\ncontracts are standardized as to maturity date\nand underlying instrument and are traded on\nfutures exchanges. The Fund may purchase and\nwrite (sell) call and put options on futures.\nOptions on futures give the holder the right,\nin return for the premium paid, to assume a\nlong position (call) or short position (put)\nin a futures contract at a specified exercise\nprice upon expiration of, or at any time\nduring the period of, the option. Upon\nexercise of a call option, the holder acquires\na long position in the futures contract and\nthe writer is assigned the opposite short\nposition. In the case of a put option, the\nopposite is true. The Fund is required to make\na good faith margin deposit in cash or U.S.\ngovernment securities (or other eligible\ncollateral) with a broker or custodian to\ninitiate and maintain open positions in\nfutures contracts. A margin deposit is\nintended to assure completion of the contract\n(delivery or acceptance of the underlying\ncommodity or payment of the cash settlement\namount) if it is not terminated prior to the\nspecified delivery date. Brokers may establish\ndeposit requirements which are higher than the\nexchange minimums. Futures contracts are\ncustomarily purchased and sold on margin\ndeposits which may range upward from less than\n5% of the value of the contract being traded.\nAfter a futures contract position is opened,\nthe value of the contract is marked to market\ndaily. If the futures contract price changes\nto the extent that the margin on deposit does\nnot satisfy price changes additional payments\nwill be required. Conversely, change in the\ncontract value may reduce the required margin,\nresulting in a repayment of excess margin to\nthe contract holder. Variation margin payments\nare made to and from the futures broker for as\nlong as the contract remains open. In such\ncase, the Fund would expect to earn interest\nincome on its margin deposits. Although some\nfutures contracts call for making or taking\ndelivery of the underlying commodity,\ngenerally these obligations are closed out\nprior to delivery by offsetting purchases or\nsales of matching futures contracts (involving\nthe same exchange, underlying security or\nindex and delivery month). If an offsetting\npurchase price is less than the original sale\nprice, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if\nit is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss.\nConversely, if an offsetting sale price is\nmore than the original purchase price, the\nFund realizes a capital gain, or if it is\nless, the Fund realizes a capital loss. The\ntransaction costs also must be included in\nthese calculations. Regulation Under the\nCommodity Exchange Act. The Fund intends to\nuse commodity interests such as futures, swaps\nand options on futures in accordance with Rule\n4.5 of the CEA. The Fund may use exchange-\ntraded futures and options on futures,\ntogether with positions in cash and money\nmarket instruments, to simulate full\ninvestment in its underlying Index. Exchange-\ntraded futures and options on futures\ncontracts may not be currently available for\nthe Index. Under such circumstances, the\nAdviser may seek to utilize other instruments\nthat it believes to be correlated to the Index\ncomponents or a subset of the components. An\nexclusion from the definition of the term\n\u201ccommodity pool operator\u201d has been claimed\nwith respect to each series of the Trust in\naccordance with Rule 4.5 such that\nregistration or regulation as a commodity pool\noperator under the CEA is not necessary.\nRestrictions on Trading in Commodity\nInterests. The Fund reserves the right to\nengage in transactions involving futures,\noptions thereon and swaps to the extent\nallowed by the CFTC regulations in effect from\ntime to time and in accordance with the Fund\u2019s\npolicies. The Fund would take steps to prevent\nits futures positions from \u201cleveraging\u201d its\nsecurities holdings. When it has a long\nfutures position, it will maintain with its\ncustodian bank assets substantially identical\nto those underlying the contract or cash and\nequivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position). When it has a\nshort futures position, it will maintain with\nits custodian bank assets substantially\nidentical to those underlying the contract or\ncash and equivalents (or a combination of the\nforegoing) having a value equal to the net\nobligation of the Fund under the contract\n(less the value of any margin deposits in\nconnection with the position). Options. The\nFund may purchase and sell put and call\noptions. Such options may relate to particular\nsecurities and may or may not be listed on a\nnational securities exchange and issued by the\nOptions Clearing Corporation. Options trading\nis a highly specialized activity that entails\ngreater than ordinary investment risk. Options\non particular securities may be more volatile\nthan the underlying securities, and therefore,\non a percentage basis, an investment in\noptions may be subject to greater fluctuation\nthan an investment in the underlying\nsecurities themselves. Short Sales \u201cAgainst\nthe Box.\u201dThe Fund may engage in short sales\n\u201cagainst the box.\u201d In a short sale against the\nbox, the Fund agrees to sell at a future date\na security that it either contemporaneously\nowns or has the right to acquire at no extra\ncost. If the price of the security has\ndeclined at the time the Fund is required to\ndeliver the security, the Fund will benefit\nfrom the difference in the price. If the price\nof the security has increased, the Fund will\nbe required to pay the difference. 5 Table of\nContents Swap Transactions. The Fund may enter\ninto swap transactions, including interest\nrate, swap, credit default swap, NDF, and\ntotal return swap transactions. Swap\ntransactions are contracts between parties in\nwhich one party agrees to make periodic\npayments to the other party based on the\nchange in market value or level of a specified\nrate, index or asset. In return, the other\nparty agrees to make payments to the first\nparty based on the return of a different\nspecified rate, index or asset. Swap\ntransactions will usually be done on a net\nbasis, i.e., where the two parties make net\npayments with the Fund receiving or paying, as\nthe case may be, only the net amount of the\ntwo payments. The net amount of the excess, if\nany, of the Fund\u2019s obligations over its\nentitlements with respect to each swap is\naccrued on a daily basis and an amount of cash\nor equivalents having an aggregate value at\nleast equal to the accrued excess is\nmaintained by the Fund. Swaps may be used in\nconjunction with other instruments to offset\ninterest rate, currency or other underlying\nrisks. For example, interest rate swaps may be\noffset with \u201ccaps,\u201d \u201cfloors\u201d or \u201ccollars\u201d. A\n\u201ccap\u201d is essentially a call option which\nplaces a limit on the amount of floating rate\ninterest that must be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201cfloor\u201d is essentially a\nput option which places a limit on the minimum\namount that would be paid on a certain\nprincipal amount. A \u201ccollar\u201d is essentially a\ncombination of a long cap and a short floor\nwhere the limits are set at different levels.\nThe use of swap transactions by the Fund\nentails certain risks, which may be different\nfrom, or possibly greater than, the risks\nassociated with investing directly in the\nsecurities and other investments that are the\nreferenced asset for the swap agreement. Swaps\nare highly specialized instruments that\nrequire investment techniques, risk analyses,\nand tax planning different from those\nassociated with stocks, bonds, and other\ntraditional investments. The use of a swap\nrequires an understanding not only of the\nreferenced asset, reference rate, or index,\nbut also of the swap itself, without the\nbenefit of observing the performance of the\nswap under all the possible market conditions.\nBecause some swap transactions have a leverage\ncomponent, adverse changes in the value or\nlevel of the underlying asset, reference rate,\nor index can result in a loss substantially\ngreater than the amount invested in the swap\nitself. Certain swaps have the potential for\nunlimited loss, regardless of the size of the\ninitial investment. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-\nFrank Act\u201d) that was signed into law on July\n21, 2010 created a new statutory framework\nthat comprehensively regulated the over-the-\ncounter(\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives markets for the\nfirst time. Key Dodd-Frank Act provisions\nrelating to OTC derivatives require rulemaking\nby the SEC and the CFTC, not all of which has\nbeen proposed or finalized as at the date of\nthis SAI. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTC\nderivatives markets were traditionally traded\non a bilateral basis (so-called\u201cbilateral OTC\ntransactions\u201d). Under the Dodd-Frank Act,\ncertain OTC derivatives transactions are now\nrequired to be centrally cleared and traded on\nexchanges or electronic trading platforms\ncalled swap execution facilities (\u201cSEFs\u201d).\nBilateral OTC transactions differ from\nexchange-traded or cleared derivatives\ntransactions in several respects. Bilateral\nOTC transactions are transacted directly with\ndealers and not with a clearing corporation.\nWithout the availability of a clearing\ncorporation, bilateral OTC transaction pricing\nis normally done by reference to information\nfrom market makers and/or available index\ndata, which information is carefully monitored\nby the Adviser and verified in appropriate\ncases. As bilateral OTC transactions are\nentered into directly with a dealer, there is\na risk of nonperformance by the dealer as a\nresult of its insolvency or otherwise. Under\nrecently-adopted regulations by the CFTC and\nfederal banking regulators (\u201cMargin Rules\u201d),\nthe Fund is required to post collateral (known\nas variation margin) to cover the mark-to-\nmarketexposure in respect of its uncleared\nswaps. The Margin Rules also mandate that\ncollateral in the form of initial margin be\nposted to cover potential future exposure\nattributable to uncleared swap transactions.\nIn the event the Fund is required to post\ncollateral in the form of initial margin or\nvariation margin in respect of its uncleared\nswap transactions, all such collateral will be\nposted with a third party custodian pursuant\nto a triparty custody agreement between the\nFund, its dealer counterparty and an\nunaffiliated custodian. The requirement to\nexecute certain OTC derivatives contracts on\nSEFs may offer certain advantages over\ntraditional bilateral OTC trading, such as\nease of execution, price transparency,\nincreased liquidity and/or favorable pricing.\nHowever, SEF trading may make it more\ndifficult and costly for the Fund to enter\ninto highly tailored or customized\ntransactions and may result in additional\ncosts and risks. Market participants such as\nthe Fund that execute derivatives contracts\nthrough a SEF, whether directly or through a\nbroker intermediary, are required to submit to\nthe jurisdiction of the SEF and comply with\nSEF and CFTC rules and regulations which\nimpose, among other things disclosure and\nrecordkeeping obligations. In addition, the\nFund will generally incur SEF or broker\nintermediary fees when it trades on a SEF. The\nFund may also be required to indemnify the SEF\nor broker intermediary for any losses or costs\nthat may result from the Fund\u2019s transactions\non the SEF. Total Return Swaps. The Fund may\nenter into total return swap transactions for\ninvestment purposes. Total return swaps are\ntransactions in which one party agrees to make\nperiodic payments based on the change in\nmarket value of the underlying assets, which\nmay include a specified security, basket of\nsecurities or security indexes during the\nspecified period, in return for periodic\npayments based on a fixed or variable interest\nrate of the total return from other underlying\nassets. Total return swaps may be used to\nobtain exposure to a security or market\nwithout owning or taking physical custody of\nsuch security or market, including in cases in\nwhich there may be disadvantages associated\nwith direct ownership of a particular\nsecurity. In a typical total return equity\nswap, payments made by the Fund or the\ncounterparty are based on the total return of\na particular reference asset or assets (such\nas an equity security, a 6 Table of Contents\ncombination of such securities, or an index).\nThat is, one party agrees to pay another party\nthe return on a stock, basket of stocks, or\nstock index in return for a specified interest\nrate. By entering into an equity index swap,\nfor example, the index receiver can gain\nexposure to stocks making up the index of\nsecurities without actually purchasing those\nstocks. Total return swaps involve not only\nthe risk associated with the investment in the\nunderlying securities, but also the risk of\nthe counterparty not fulfilling its\nobligations under the agreement. Credit\nDefault Swaps. The Fund may enter into credit\ndefault swap transactions for investment\npurposes. A credit default swap transaction\nmay have as reference obligations one or more\nsecurities that are not currently held by the\nFund. The Fund may be either the protection\nbuyer or protection seller in the transaction.\nCredit default swaps may also be structured\nbased on the debt of a basket of issuers,\nrather than a single issuer, and may be\ncustomized with respect to the default event\nthat triggers purchase or other factors. As a\nprotection seller, the Fund would generally\nreceive an upfront payment or a fixed rate of\nincome throughout the term of the swap, which\ntypically is between six months and three\nyears, provided that there is no credit event.\nIf a credit event occurs, generally the\nprotection seller must pay the protection\nbuyer the full face amount of the reference\nobligations that may have little or no value.\nThe notional value of the credit default swap\nwill be used to segregate liquid assets for\nselling protection on credit default swaps. If\nthe Fund were a protection buyer and no credit\nevent occurred during the term of the swap,\nthe Fund would recover nothing if the swap\nwere held through its termination date.\nHowever, if a credit event occurred, the\nprotection buyer may elect to receive the full\nnotional value of the swap in exchange for an\nequal face amount of the reference obligation\nthat may have little or no value. Where the\nFund is the protection buyer, credit default\nswaps involve the risk that the seller may\nfail to satisfy its payment obligations to the\nFund in the event of a default. The purchase\nof credit default swaps involves costs, which\nwill reduce the Fund\u2019s return. When the Fund\nbuys credit default swaps it will segregate an\namount at least equal to the amount of any\naccrued premium payment obligations including\namounts for early terminations. Currency\nSwaps. The Fund may enter into currency swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. Currency\nswaps are similar to interest rate swaps,\nexcept that they involve multiple currencies.\nThe Fund may enter into a currency swap when\nit has exposure to one currency and desires\nexposure to a different currency. Typically,\nthe interest rates that determine the currency\nswap payments are fixed, although occasionally\none or both parties may pay a floating rate of\ninterest. Unlike an interest rate swap,\nhowever, the principal amounts are exchanged\nat the beginning of the contract and returned\nat the end of the contract. In addition to\npaying and receiving amounts at the beginning\nand end of the transaction, both sides will\nhave to pay in full on a periodic basis based\nupon the currency they have borrowed. Change\nin foreign exchange rates and changes in\ninterest rates, as described above, may\nnegatively affect currency swaps. Interest\nRate Swaps. The Fund may enter into an\ninterest rate swap in an effort to protect\nagainst declines in the value of fixed income\nsecurities held by the Fund. In such an\ninstance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed\nrate (multiplied by a notional amount) while a\ncounterparty agrees to pay a floating rate\n(multiplied by the same notional amount). If\ninterest rates rise, resulting in a diminution\nin the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio, the Fund\nwould receive payments under the swap that\nwould offset, in whole or in part, such\ndiminution in value. Options on Swaps. An\noption on a swap agreement, or a \u201cswaption,\u201d\nis a contract that gives a counterparty the\nright (but not the obligation) to enter into a\nnew swap agreement or to shorten, extend,\ncancel or otherwise modify an existing swap\nagreement, at some designated future time on\nspecified terms. In return, the purchaser pays\na \u201cpremium\u201d to the seller of the contract. The\nseller of the contract receives the premium\nand bears the risk of unfavorable changes on\nthe underlying swap. The Fund may write (sell)\nand purchase put and call swaptions. The Fund\nmay also enter into swaptions on either an\nasset-based or liability-based basis,\ndepending on whether the Fund is hedging its\nassets or its liabilities. The Fund may write\n(sell) and purchase put and call swaptions to\nthe same extent it may make use of standard\noptions on securities or other instruments.\nThe Fund may enter into these transactions\nprimarily to preserve a return or spread on a\nparticular investment or portion of its\nholdings, as a duration management technique,\nto protect against an increase in the price of\nsecurities the Fund anticipates purchasing at\na later date, or for any other purposes, such\nas for speculation to increase returns.\nSwaptions are generally subject to the same\nrisks involved in the Fund\u2019s use of options.\nDepending on the terms of the particular\noption agreement, the Fund will generally\nincur a greater degree of risk when it writes\na swaption than it will incur when it\npurchases a swaption. When the Fund purchases\na swaption, it risks losing only the amount of\nthe premium it has paid should it decide to\nlet the option expire unexercised. However,\nwhen the Fund writes a swaption, upon exercise\nof the option the Fund will become obligated\naccording to the terms of the underlying\nagreement. Certain additional risk factors\nrelated to derivatives are discussed below:\nDerivatives Risk. Under recently adopted rules\nby the CFTC, transactions in some types of\ninterest rate swaps and index credit default\nswaps on North American and European indices\nare required to be cleared. In addition, the\nCFTC may promulgate additional regulations\nthat require clearing of other classes of\nswaps. In a cleared derivatives transaction\n(which includes commodities futures and\ncleared swaps transactions), the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty is a clearing house (such as CME,\nICE Clear Credit or LCH.Clearnet), rather than\na bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a\nmember of a clearing house and only members of\na clearing house can participate 7 Table of\nContents directly in the clearing house, the\nFund holds cleared derivatives through\naccounts at clearing members, who are futures\ncommission merchants that are members of the\nclearing houses and who have the appropriate\nregulatory approvals to engage in cleared swap\ntransactions. The Fund makes and receives\npayments owed under cleared derivatives\ntransactions (including margin payments)\nthrough its accounts at clearing members.\nClearing members guarantee performance of\ntheir clients\u2019 obligations to the clearing\nhouse. In contrast to bilateral OTC\ntransactions, clearing members generally can\nrequire termination of existing cleared\nderivatives transactions at any time and\nincreases in margin above the margin that it\nrequired at the beginning of a transaction.\nClearing houses also have broad rights to\nincrease margin requirements for existing\ntransactions and to terminate transactions.\nAny such increase or termination could\ninterfere with the ability of the Fund to\npursue its investment strategy. Also, the Fund\nis subject to execution risk if it enters into\na derivatives transaction that is required to\nbe cleared (or that the Advisor expects to be\ncleared), and no clearing member is willing or\nable to clear the transaction on the Fund\u2019s\nbehalf. While the documentation in place\nbetween the Fund and its clearing members\ngenerally provides that the clearing members\nwill accept for clearing all transactions\nsubmitted for clearing that are within credit\nlimits specified by the clearing members in\nadvance, the Fund could be subject to this\nexecution risk if the Fund submits for\nclearing transactions that exceed such credit\nlimits, if the clearing house does not accept\nthe transactions for clearing, or if the\nclearing members do not comply with their\nagreement to clear such transactions. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of any increase in the\nvalue of the transaction after the time of the\ntransaction. In addition, new regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict the Fund\u2019s\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to\nthe Fund of, derivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund or increasing\nmargin or capital requirements. If the Fund is\nnot able to enter into a particular\nderivatives transaction, the Fund\u2019s investment\nperformance and risk profile could be\nadversely affected as a result. Counterparty\nRisk. Counterparty risk with respect to OTC\nderivatives may be affected by new regulations\npromulgated by the CFTC and SEC affecting the\nderivatives market. As described under\n\u201cDerivatives Risk\u201d above, some derivatives\ntransactions are required to be cleared, and a\nparty to a cleared derivatives transaction is\nsubject to the credit risk of the clearing\nhouse and the clearing member through which it\nholds its cleared derivatives position, rather\nthan the credit risk of its original\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction.\nClearing members are required to segregate all\nfunds received from customers with respect to\ncleared derivatives transactions from the\nclearing member\u2019s proprietary assets. However,\nall funds and other property received by a\nclearing broker from its customers are\ngenerally held by the clearing broker on a\ncommingled basis in an omnibus account, which\nmay also invest those funds in certain\ninstruments permitted under the applicable\nregulations. Also, the clearing member\ntransfers to the clearing house the amount of\nmargin required by the clearing house for\ncleared derivatives transactions, which\namounts are generally held in the relevant\nomnibus account at the clearing house for all\ncustomers of the clearing member. For\ncommodities futures positions, the clearing\nhouse may use all of the collateral held in\nthe clearing member\u2019s omnibus account to meet\na loss in that account, without regard to\nwhich customer in fact supplied that\ncollateral. Accordingly, in addition to\nbearing the credit risk of its clearing\nmember, each customer to a futures transaction\nalso bears \u201cfellow customer\u201d risk from other\ncustomers of the clearing member. However,\nwith respect to cleared swaps positions,\nrecent regulations promulgated by the CFTC\nrequire that the clearing member notify the\nclearing house of the amount of initial margin\nprovided by the clearing member to the\nclearing house that is attributable to each\ncustomer. Because margin in respect of cleared\nswaps must be earmarked for specific clearing\nmember customers, the clearing house may not\nuse the collateral of one customer to cover\nthe obligations of another customer. However,\nif the clearing member does not provide\naccurate reporting, the Fund is subject to the\nrisk that a clearing house will use the Fund\u2019s\nassets held in an omnibus account at the\nclearing house to satisfy payment obligations\nof a defaulting customer of the clearing\nmember to the clearing house. In addition,\nclearing members may generally choose to\nprovide to the clearing house the net amount\nof variation margin required for cleared swaps\nfor all of its customers in the aggregate,\nrather than the gross amount for each\ncustomer. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The Fund may\ntake advantage of opportunities in the area of\noptions and futures contracts, options on\nfutures contracts, warrants, swaps and any\nother investments which are not presently\ncontemplated for use by the Fund or which are\nnot currently available but which may be\ndeveloped, to the extent such opportunities\nare both consistent with the Fund\u2019s investment\nobjective and legally permissible for the\nFund. Before entering into such transactions\nor making any such investment, the Fund will\nprovide appropriate disclosure. INVESTMENT\nCOMPANIES The Fund may invest in the\nsecurities of other investment companies,\nincluding affiliated funds and money market\nfunds, subject to applicable limitations under\nSection 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to\nSection 12(d)(1), the Fund may invest in the\nsecurities of another investment company (the\n\u201cacquired company\u201d) provided that the Fund,\nimmediately after such purchase or\nacquisition, does not own in the aggregate:\n(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the acquired company; (ii)\nsecurities issued by the acquired company\nhaving an aggregate value in excess of 5% of\nthe value of the total assets of the Fund; or\n(iii) securities issued by the acquired\ncompany and all other investment companies\n(other than Treasury stock of the Fund) having\nan aggregate value in excess of 10% of the\nvalue of the total assets of the Fund. To the\nextent allowed by law, regulation, the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment restrictions and the Trust\u2019s\nexemptive relief, the Fund may invest its\nassets in securities of investment companies\nthat are affiliated funds and/or money market\nfunds in excess of the limits discussed above.\n8 Table of Contents If the Fund invests in\nand, thus, is a shareholder of, another\ninvestment company, the Fund\u2019s shareholders\nwill indirectly bear the Fund\u2019s proportionate\nshare of the fees and expenses paid by such\nother investment company, including advisory\nfees, in addition to both the management fees\npayable directly by the Fund to the Fund\u2019s own\ninvestment adviser and the other expenses that\nthe Fund bears directly in connection with the\nFund\u2019s own operations. LENDING PORTFOLIO\nSECURITIES The Fund may lend portfolio\nsecurities to certain creditworthy borrowers\nin U.S. and non-U.S.markets in an amount not\nto exceed 40% of the value of its net assets.\nThe borrowers provide collateral that is\nmarked to market daily in an amount at least\nequal to the current market value of the\nsecurities loaned. The Fund may terminate a\nloan at any time and obtain the securities\nloaned. The Fund receives the value of any\ninterest or cash or non-cashdistributions paid\non the loaned securities. The Fund cannot vote\nproxies for securities on loan, but may recall\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the Fund\u2019s economic interest in the\ninvestment is to be voted upon. Efforts to\nrecall such securities promptly may be\nunsuccessful, especially for foreign\nsecurities or thinly traded securities, and\nmay involve expenses to the Fund.\nDistributions received on loaned securities in\nlieu of dividend payments (i.e., substitute\npayments) would not be considered qualified\ndividend income. With respect to loans that\nare collateralized by cash, the borrower will\nbe entitled to receive a fee based on the\namount of cash collateral. The Fund is\ncompensated by the difference between the\namount earned on the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral and the fee paid to the borrower.\nIn the case of collateral other than cash, the\nFund is compensated by a fee paid by the\nborrower equal to a percentage of the market\nvalue of the loaned securities. Any cash\ncollateral may be reinvested in certain high\nquality short-term instruments either directly\non behalf of the Fund or through one or more\njoint accounts or funds, which may include\nthose managed by the Adviser. The Fund could\nlose money due to a decline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned securities or\nany investments made with cash collateral.\nCertain non-cashcollateral or investments made\nwith cash collateral may have a greater risk\nof loss than other non-cashcollateral or\ninvestments. The Fund may pay a portion of the\ninterest or fees earned from securities\nlending to a borrower as described above, and\nto one or more securities lending agents\napproved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust\n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) who administer the lending\nprogram for the Fund in accordance with\nguidelines approved by the Board. In such\ncapacity, the lending agent provides the\nfollowing services to the Fund in connection\nwith the Fund\u2019s securities lending activities:\n(i) locating borrowers among an approved list\nof prospective borrowers; (ii) causing the\ndelivery of loaned securities from the Fund to\nborrowers; (iii) monitoring the value of\nloaned securities, the value of collateral\nreceived, and other lending parameters; (iv)\nseeking additional collateral, as necessary,\nfrom borrowers; (v) receiving and holding\ncollateral from borrowers, and facilitating\nthe investment and reinvestment of all or\nsubstantially all cash collateral in an\ninvestment vehicle designated by the Fund;\n(vi) returning collateral to borrowers; (vii)\nfacilitating substitute dividend, interest,\nand other distribution payments to the Fund\nfrom borrowers; (viii) negotiating the terms\nof each loan of securities, including but not\nlimited to the amount of any loan premium, and\nmonitoring the terms of securities loan\nagreements with prospective borrowers for\nconsistency with the requirements of the\nFund\u2019s Securities Lending Authorization\nAgreement; (ix) selecting securities,\nincluding amounts (percentages), to be loaned;\n(x) recordkeeping and accounting servicing;\nand (xi) arranging for return of loaned\nsecurities to the Fund in accordance with the\nterms of the Securities Lending Authorization\nAgreement. State Street Bank and Trust Company\n(\u201cState Street\u201d), an affiliate of the Trust,\nhas been approved by the Board to serve as\nsecurities lending agent for the Fund and the\nTrust has entered into an agreement with State\nStreet for such services. Among other matters,\nthe Trust has agreed to indemnify State Street\nfor certain liabilities. State Street has\nreceived an order of exemption from the SEC\nunder Sections 17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the\n1940 Act to serve as the lending agent for\naffiliated investment companies such as the\nTrust and to invest the cash collateral\nreceived from loan transactions to be invested\nin an affiliated cash collateral fund.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to\ncertain risks, including operational risk\n(i.e., the risk of losses resulting from\nproblems in the settlement and accounting\nprocess especially so in certain international\nmarkets such as Taiwan), \u201cgap\u201d risk (i.e., the\nrisk of a mismatch between the return on cash\ncollateral reinvestments and the fees the Fund\nhas agreed to pay a borrower), risk of loss of\ncollateral, credit, legal, counterparty and\nmarket risk. If a securities lending\ncounterparty were to default, the Fund would\nbe subject to the risk of a possible delay in\nreceiving collateral or in recovering the\nloaned securities, or to a possible loss of\nrights in the collateral. In the event a\nborrower does not return the Fund\u2019s securities\nas agreed, the Fund may experience losses if\nthe proceeds received from liquidating the\ncollateral do not at least equal the value of\nthe loaned security at the time the collateral\nis liquidated, plus the transaction costs\nincurred in purchasing replacement securities.\nAlthough State Street has agreed to provide\nthe Fund with indemnification in the event of\na borrower default, the Fund is still exposed\nto the risk of losses in the event a borrower\ndoes not return the Fund\u2019s securities as\nagreed. For example, delays in recovery of\nlent securities may cause the Fund to lose the\nopportunity to sell the securities at a\ndesirable price. 9 Table of Contents\nLEVERAGING While the Fund does not anticipate\ndoing so, the Fund may borrow money in an\namount greater than 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s total assets. However, under normal\ncircumstances, the Fund will not borrow money\nfrom a bank in an amount greater than 10% of\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s total assets.\nBorrowing for investment purposes is one form\nof leverage. Leveraging investments, by\npurchasing securities with borrowed money, is\na speculative technique that increases\ninvestment risk, but also increases investment\nopportunity. Because substantially all of the\nFund\u2019s assets will fluctuate in value, whereas\nthe interest obligations on borrowings may be\nfixed, the NAV of the Fund will increase more\nwhen the Fund\u2019s portfolio assets increase in\nvalue and decrease more when the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio assets decrease in value than would\notherwise be the case. Moreover, interest\ncosts on borrowings may fluctuate with\nchanging market rates of interest and may\npartially offset or exceed the returns on the\nborrowed funds. OTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS\nThe Fund may invest in short-term instruments,\nincluding money market instruments, (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser),\ncash and cash equivalents, on an ongoing basis\nto provide liquidity or for other reasons.\nMoney market instruments are generally short-\nterm investments that may include but are not\nlimited to: (i) shares of money market funds\n(including those advised by the Adviser); (ii)\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment, its agencies or instrumentalities\n(including government-sponsored enterprises);\n(iii) negotiable certificates of deposit\n(\u201cCDs\u201d), bankers\u2019 acceptances, fixed time\ndeposits and other obligations of U.S. and\nforeign banks (including foreign branches) and\nsimilar institutions; (iv) commercial paper\nrated at the date of purchase \u201cPrime-1\u201dby\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) or\n\u201cA-1\u201dby Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d), or if\nunrated, of comparable quality as determined\nby the Adviser; (v) non-convertiblecorporate\ndebt securities ( e.g., bonds and debentures)\nwith remaining maturities at the date of\npurchase of not more than 397 days and that\npresent minimal credit risks; and (vi) short-\nterm U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of\nforeign banks (including U.S. branches) that,\nin the opinion of the Adviser, are of\ncomparable quality to obligations of U.S.\nbanks which may be purchased by the Fund. Any\nof these instruments may be purchased on a\ncurrent or a forward-settled basis. Time\ndeposits are non-negotiabledeposits maintained\nin banking institutions for specified periods\nof time at stated interest rates. Bankers\u2019\nacceptances are time drafts drawn on\ncommercial banks by borrowers, usually in\nconnection with international transactions.\nMoney market instruments also include shares\nof money market funds. The SEC and other\ngovernment agencies continue to review the\nregulation of money market funds. The SEC has\nadopted changes to the rules that govern money\nmarket funds, and compliance with many of\nthese amendments was required in October 2016.\nLegislative developments may also affect money\nmarket funds. These changes and developments\nmay affect the investment strategies,\nperformance, yield, operating expenses and\ncontinued viability of a money market fund.\nRATINGS An investment-grade rating means the\nsecurity or issuer is rated investment-grade\nby Moody\u2019s, S&P, Fitch, Inc. (\u201cFitch\u201d),\nDominion Bond Rating Service Limited, or\nanother credit rating agency designated as a\nnationally recognized statistical rating\norganization by the SEC, or is unrated but\nconsidered to be of equivalent quality by the\nAdviser. Subsequent to purchase by the Fund, a\nrated security may cease to be rated or its\ninvestment-grade rating may be reduced below\nan investment-grade rating. Bonds rated lower\nthan Baa3 by Moody\u2019s or BBB-by S&P or Fitch\nare below investment-grade quality and are\nobligations of issuers that are considered\npredominantly speculative with respect to the\nissuer\u2019s capacity to pay interest and repay\nprincipal according to the terms of the\nobligation and, therefore, carry greater\ninvestment risk, including the possibility of\nissuer default and bankruptcy and increased\nmarket price volatility. Such securities\n(\u201clower rated securities\u201d) are commonly\nreferred to as \u201cjunk bonds\u201d and are subject to\na substantial degree of credit risk. Lower\nrated securities are often issued by smaller,\nless creditworthy companies or by highly\nleveraged (indebted) firms, which are\ngenerally less able than more financially\nstable firms to make scheduled payments of\ninterest and principal. The risks posed by\nsecurities issued under such circumstances are\nsubstantial. Bonds rated below investment-\ngrade tend to be less marketable than higher-\nquality bonds because the market for them is\nless broad. The market for unrated bonds is\neven narrower. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS The Fund\nmay invest in repurchase agreements with\ncommercial banks, brokers or dealers to\ngenerate income from its excess cash balances\nand to invest securities lending cash\ncollateral. A repurchase agreement is an\nagreement under which the Fund acquires a\nfinancial instrument ( e.g., a security issued\nby the U.S. government or an agency thereof, a\nbanker\u2019s acceptance or a certificate of\ndeposit) from a seller, subject to resale to\nthe seller at an agreed upon price and date\n(normally, the next Business Day \u2013 as defined\nbelow). A repurchase agreement may be\nconsidered a loan collateralized by\nsecurities. The resale price reflects an\nagreed upon interest rate effective for the\nperiod the instrument is held by the Fund and\nis unrelated to the interest rate on the\nunderlying instrument. In these repurchase\nagreement transactions, the securities\nacquired by the Fund (including accrued\ninterest earned thereon) must have a total\nvalue in excess of the value of the repurchase\nagreement and are held by the Custodian until\nrepurchased. No more than an aggregate of 15%\nof the Fund\u2019s net assets will be invested in\nilliquid securities, including repurchase\nagreements having maturities longer than seven\ndays and securities subject to legal or\ncontractual restrictions on resale, or for\nwhich there are no readily available market\nquotations. 10 Table of Contents The use of\nrepurchase agreements involves certain risks.\nFor example, if the other party to the\nagreement defaults on its obligation to\nrepurchase the underlying security at a time\nwhen the value of the security has declined,\nthe Fund may incur a loss upon disposition of\nthe security. If the other party to the\nagreement becomes insolvent and subject to\nliquidation or reorganization under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or other laws, a court may\ndetermine that the underlying security is\ncollateral for a loan by the Fund not within\nthe control of the Fund and, therefore, the\nFund may not be able to substantiate its\ninterest in the underlying security and may be\ndeemed an unsecured creditor of the other\nparty to the agreement. REVERSE REPURCHASE\nAGREEMENTS The Fund may enter into reverse\nrepurchase agreements, which involve the sale\nof securities with an agreement to repurchase\nthe securities at an agreed-upon price, date\nand interest payment and have the\ncharacteristics of borrowing. The securities\npurchased with the funds obtained from the\nagreement and securities collateralizing the\nagreement will have maturity dates no later\nthan the repayment date. Generally the effect\nof such transactions is that the Fund can\nrecover all or most of the cash invested in\nthe portfolio securities involved during the\nterm of the reverse repurchase agreement,\nwhile in many cases the Fund is able to keep\nsome of the interest income associated with\nthose securities. Such transactions are only\nadvantageous if the Fund has an opportunity to\nearn a greater rate of interest on the cash\nderived from these transactions than the\ninterest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from\nthe use of the proceeds equal to or greater\nthan the interest required to be paid may not\nalways be available and the Fund intends to\nuse the reverse repurchase technique only when\nthe Adviser believes it will be advantageous\nto the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase\nagreements may exaggerate any interim increase\nor decrease in the value of the Fund\u2019s assets.\nThe Fund\u2019s exposure to reverse repurchase\nagreements will be covered by securities\nhaving a value equal to or greater than such\ncommitments. Under the 1940 Act, reverse\nrepurchase agreements are considered\nborrowings. Although there is no percentage\nlimit on Fund assets that can be used in\nconnection with reverse repurchase agreements,\nthe Fund does not expect to engage, under\nnormal circumstances, in reverse repurchase\nagreements with respect to more than 10% of\nits total assets. U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS\nU.S. Government obligations are a type of\nbond. U.S. Government obligations include\nsecurities issued or guaranteed as to\nprincipal and interest by the U.S. Government,\nits agencies or instrumentalities. One type of\nU.S. Government obligation, U.S. Treasury\nobligations, are backed by the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. Treasury and differ only in\ntheir interest rates, maturities, and times of\nissuance. U.S. Treasury bills have initial\nmaturities of one-yearor less; U.S. Treasury\nnotes have initial maturities of one to ten\nyears; and U.S. Treasury bonds generally have\ninitial maturities of greater than ten years.\nOther U.S. Government obligations are issued\nor guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities\nof the U.S. Government including, but not\nlimited to, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), the Government\nNational Mortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d),\nthe Small Business Administration, the Federal\nFarm Credit Administration, the Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d), the\nFederal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLB\u201d), Banks for\nCooperatives (including the Central Bank for\nCooperatives), the Federal Land Banks, the\nFederal Intermediate Credit Banks, the\nTennessee Valley Authority, the Export-Import\nBank of the United States, the Commodity\nCredit Corporation, the Federal Financing\nBank, the Student Loan Marketing Association,\nthe National Credit Union Administration and\nthe Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation\n(Farmer Mac). Some obligations issued or\nguaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and\ninstrumentalities, including, for example,\nGinnie Mae pass-through certificates, are\nsupported by the full faith and credit of the\nU.S. Treasury. Other obligations issued by or\nguaranteed by federal agencies, such as those\nsecurities issued by Fannie Mae, are supported\nby the discretionary authority of the U.S.\nGovernment to purchase certain obligations of\nthe federal agency, while other obligations\nissued by or guaranteed by federal agencies,\nsuch as those of the Federal Home Loan Banks,\nare supported by the right of the issuer to\nborrow from the U.S. Treasury. While the U.S.\nGovernment provides financial support to such\nU.S. Government-sponsored federal agencies, no\nassurance can be given that the U.S.\nGovernment will always do so, since the U.S.\nGovernment is not so obligated by law. In\nSeptember 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a\nfederal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac, placing the two federal instrumentalities\nin conservatorship. Under the terms of the\ntakeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed to acquire\n$1 billion of senior preferred stock of each\ninstrumentality and obtained warrants for the\npurchase of common stock of each\ninstrumentality. Under these Senior Preferred\nStock Purchase Agreements (\u201cSPAs\u201d), the U.S.\nTreasury has pledged to provide a limited\namount of capital per instrumentality as\nneeded, including the contribution of cash\ncapital to the instrumentalities in the event\ntheir liabilities exceed their assets. In May\n2009, the U.S. Treasury increased its maximum\ncommitment to each instrumentality under the\nSPAs from $100 billion to $200 billion per\ninstrumentality. In December 2009, the U.S.\nTreasury amended the SPAs to provide Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac with some additional\nflexibility to meet the requirement to reduce\ntheir mortgage portfolios. Also in December\n2009, the U.S. 11 Table of Contents Treasury\nfurther amended the SPAs to allow the cap on\nthe U.S. Treasury\u2019s funding commitment to\nincrease as necessary to accommodate any\ncumulative reduction in Fannie Mae\u2019s and\nFreddie Mac\u2019s net worth through the end of\n2012. On August 17, 2012, the U.S. Treasury\nannounced that it was again amending the SPAs\nto terminate the requirement that Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac each pay a 10% dividend\nannually on all amounts received under the\nfunding commitment. Instead, they were\nrequired to transfer to the U.S. Treasury on a\nquarterly basis all profits earned during a\nquarter that exceeded a capital reserve amount\nof $3 billion. On September 30, 2019, the U.S.\nTreasury announced amendments to the SPAs\npermitting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to\nmaintain capital reserves of $25 billion and\n$20 billion, respectively. It is believed that\nthe amendment puts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nin a better position to service their debt\nbecause the companies no longer have to borrow\nfrom the U.S. Treasury to make fixed dividend\npayments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the\nsubject of several continuing class action\nlawsuits and investigations by federal\nregulators over certain accounting, disclosure\nor corporate governance matters, which (along\nwith any resulting financial restatements) may\nadversely affect the guaranteeing entities.\nImportantly, the future of the entities is in\nserious question as the U.S. government\nreportedly is considering multiple options,\nranging from nationalization, privatization,\nconsolidation, or abolishment of the entities.\nVARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES Variable\nrate securities are instruments issued or\nguaranteed by entities such as (1) US\nGovernment, or an agency or instrumentality\nthereof, (2) states, municipalities and other\npolitical subdivisions, agencies, authorities\nand instrumentalities or states and multi-\nstate agencies or authorities (3)\ncorporations, (4) financial institutions, (5)\ninsurance companies or (6) trusts that have a\nrate of interest subject to adjustment at\nregular intervals but less frequently than\nannually. A variable rate security provides\nfor the automatic establishment of a new\ninterest rate on set dates. Variable rate\nobligations whose interest is readjusted no\nless frequently than annually will be deemed\nto have a maturity equal to the period\nremaining until the next readjustment of the\ninterest rate. The Fund may also purchase\nfloating rate securities. A floating rate\nsecurity provides for the automatic adjustment\nof its interest rate whenever a specified\ninterest rate changes. Interest rates on these\nsecurities are ordinarily tied to, and are a\npercentage of, a widely recognized interest\nrate, such as the yield on 90-dayUS Treasury\nbills or the prime rate of a specified bank.\nThese rates may change as often as twice\ndaily. Generally, changes in interest rates\nwill have a smaller effect on the market value\nof variable and fixed rate floating rate\nsecurities than on the market value of\ncomparable fixed rate fixed income\nobligations. Thus, investing in variable and\nfixed rate floating rate securities generally\nallows less opportunity for capital\nappreciation and depreciation than investing\nin comparable fixed rate fixed income\nsecurities. WHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES The Fund\nmay purchase securities on a when-issued\nbasis. Delivery of and payment for these\nsecurities may take place as long as a month\nor more after the date of the purchase\ncommitment. The value of these securities is\nsubject to market fluctuation during this\nperiod, and no income accrues to the Fund\nuntil settlement takes place. When entering\ninto a when-issued transaction, the Fund will\nrely on the other party to consummate the\ntransaction; if the other party fails to do\nso, the Fund may be disadvantaged. Securities\npurchased on a when-issued basis and held by\nthe Fund are subject to changes in market\nvalue based upon actual or perceived changes\nin the level of interest rates. Generally, the\nvalue of such securities will fluctuate\ninversely to changes in interest rates \u2014 i.e.,\nthey will appreciate in value when interest\nrates decline and decrease in value when\ninterest rates rise. Therefore, if the Fund\npurchases securities on a when-issued basis,\nthere will be a greater possibility of\nfluctuation in the Fund\u2019s NAV. SPECIAL\nCONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS A discussion of the\nrisks associated with an investment in the\nFund is contained in the Prospectus. The\ndiscussion below supplements, and should be\nread in conjunction with, the Prospectus.\nGENERAL Investment in the Fund should be made\nwith an understanding that the value of the\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities may fluctuate in\naccordance with changes in the financial\ncondition of the issuers of the portfolio\nsecurities, the value of securities generally\nand other factors. An investment in the Fund\nshould also be made with an understanding of\nthe risks inherent in an investment in\nsecurities, including the risk that the\nfinancial condition of issuers may become\nimpaired or that the general condition of the\nsecurities markets may deteriorate (either of\nwhich may cause a decrease in the value of the\nportfolio securities and thus in the value of\nShares). Securities are susceptible to general\nmarket fluctuations and to volatile increases\nand decreases in value as market confidence in\nand perceptions of their issuers change. These\ninvestor perceptions are based on various and\nunpredictable factors including expectations\nregarding 12 Table of Contents government,\neconomic, monetary and fiscal policies,\ninflation and interest rates, economic\nexpansion or contraction, and global or\nregional political, economic and banking\ncrises. Securities of issuers traded on\nexchanges may be suspended on certain\nexchanges by the issuers themselves, by an\nexchange or by government authorities. The\nlikelihood of such suspensions may be higher\nfor securities of issuers in emerging or less-\ndeveloped market countries than in countries\nwith more developed markets. Trading\nsuspensions may be applied from time to time\nto the securities of individual issuers for\nreasons specific to that issuer, or may be\napplied broadly by exchanges or governmental\nauthorities in response to market events.\nSuspensions may last for significant periods\nof time, during which trading in the\nsecurities and instruments that reference the\nsecurities, such as participatory notes (or\n\u201cP-notes\u201d)or other derivative instruments, may\nbe halted. Holders of common stock incur more\nrisk than holders of preferred stocks and debt\nobligations because common stockholders, as\nowners of the issuer, have generally inferior\nrights to receive payments from the issuer in\ncomparison with the rights of creditors of, or\nholders of debt obligations or preferred\nstocks issued by, the issuer. Further, unlike\ndebt securities which typically have a stated\nprincipal amount payable at maturity (whose\nvalue, however, will be subject to market\nfluctuations prior thereto), or preferred\nstocks which typically have a liquidation\npreference and which may have stated optional\nor mandatory redemption provisions, common\nstock have neither a fixed principal amount\nnor a maturity. Common stock values are\nsubject to market fluctuations as long as the\ncommon stock remains outstanding. The\nprincipal trading market for some of the\nsecurities in the Index may be in the over-\nthe-countermarket. The existence of a liquid\ntrading market for certain securities may\ndepend on whether dealers will make a market\nin such securities. There can be no assurance\nthat a market will be made or maintained or\nthat any such market will be or remain liquid.\nThe price at which securities may be sold and\nthe value of the Fund\u2019s Shares will be\nadversely affected if trading markets for the\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities are limited or\nabsent or if bid/ask spreads are wide. BREXIT\nRISK In June 2016, citizens of the United\nKingdom voted in a referendum to leave the EU\n(known as \u201cBrexit\u201d), creating economic and\npolitical uncertainty in its wake. In March\n2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the\nEuropean Council of the United Kingdom\u2019s\nintention to withdraw from the EU pursuant to\nArticle 50 of the Treaty on European Union.\nThis formal notification began a multi-year\nperiod of negotiations regarding the terms of\nthe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU, which\nformally concluded on January 31, 2020. The\nUnited Kingdom is currently in a transition\nperiod where it remains subject to EU rules\nbut has no role in the EU lawmaking process.\nDuring this transition period, United Kingdom\nand EU representatives are negotiating the\nprecise terms of their future relationship.\nThe transition period is scheduled to end on\nDecember 31, 2020. The full scope and nature\nof the consequences of the exit are not at\nthis time known and are unlikely to be known\nfor a significant period of time. It is also\nunknown whether the United Kingdom\u2019s exit will\nincrease the likelihood of other countries\nalso departing the EU. Any exits from the EU,\nor the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the United Kingdom,\nEurope, and global economies, which may result\nin increased volatility and illiquidity, new\nlegal and regulatory uncertainties and\npotentially lower economic growth for such\neconomies that could potentially have an\nadverse effect on the value of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK An\ninvestment in the Fund may be subject to a\nnumber of actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest. For example, the Adviser or its\naffiliates may provide services to the Fund,\nsuch as securities lending agency services,\ncustodial, administrative, bookkeeping, and\naccounting services, transfer agency and\nshareholder servicing, securities brokerage\nservices, and other services for which the\nFund would compensate the Adviser and/or such\naffiliates. The Fund may invest in other\npooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed,\nor otherwise affiliated with the Adviser.\nThere is no assurance that the rates at which\nthe Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser\nor its affiliates, or the terms on which it\nenters into transactions with the Adviser or\nits affiliates, will be the most favorable\navailable in the market generally or as\nfavorable as the rates the Adviser makes\navailable to other clients. Because of its\nfinancial interest, the Adviser may have an\nincentive to enter into transactions or\narrangements on behalf of the Fund with itself\nor its affiliates in circumstances where it\nmight not have done so in the absence of that\ninterest. CONTINUOUS OFFERING The method by\nwhich Creation Units of Shares are created and\ntraded may raise certain issues under\napplicable securities laws. Because new\nCreation Units of Shares are issued and sold\nby the Trust on an ongoing basis, at any point\na \u201cdistribution,\u201d as such term is used in the\nSecurities Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that some\nactivities on their part may, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their being deemed\nparticipants in a distribution in a manner\nwhich could render them statutory underwriters\nand subject them to the prospectus delivery\nand liability provisions of the Securities\nAct. 13 Table of Contents For example, a\nbroker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed\na statutory underwriter if it takes Creation\nUnits after placing an order with the\nDistributor, breaks them down into constituent\nShares, and sells such Shares directly to\ncustomers, or if it chooses to couple the\ncreation of a supply of new Shares with an\nactive selling effort involving solicitation\nof secondary market demand for Shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter\nfor purposes of the Securities Act must take\ninto account all the facts and circumstances\npertaining to the activities of the broker-\ndealer or its client in the particular case,\nand the examples mentioned above should not be\nconsidered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization\nas an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should\nalso note that dealers who are not\n\u201cunderwriters\u201d but are effecting transactions\nin Shares, whether or not participating in the\ndistribution of Shares, are generally required\nto deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section\n4(a)(3) of the Securities Act is not available\nin respect of such transactions as a result of\nSection 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that\nincur a prospectus-delivery obligation with\nrespect to Shares of the Fund are reminded\nthat under Securities Act Rule 153, a\nprospectus-delivery obligation under Section\n5(b)(2) of the Securities Act owed to an\nexchange member in connection with a sale on\nthe Exchange is satisfied by the fact that the\nFund\u2019s Prospectus is available at the Exchange\nupon request. The prospectus delivery\nmechanism provided in Rule 153 is only\navailable with respect to transactions on an\nexchange. SSGA or its affiliates (the \u201cSelling\nShareholder\u201d) may purchase Creation Units\nthrough a broker-dealer to \u201cseed\u201d (in whole or\nin part) the Fund as it is launched, or may\npurchase shares from broker-dealers or other\ninvestors that have previously provided \u201cseed\u201d\nfor the Fund when it was launched or otherwise\nin secondary market transactions, and because\nthe Selling Shareholder may be deemed an\naffiliate of the Fund, the Shares are being\nregistered to permit the resale of these\nshares from time to time after purchase. The\nFund will not receive any of the proceeds from\nthe resale by the Selling Shareholders of\nthese Shares. The Selling Shareholder intends\nto sell all or a portion of the Shares owned\nby it and offered hereby from time to time\ndirectly or through one or more broker-\ndealers, and may also hedge such positions.\nThe Shares may be sold on any national\nsecurities exchange on which the Shares may be\nlisted or quoted at the time of sale, in the\nover-the-countermarket or in transactions\nother than on these exchanges or systems at\nfixed prices, at prevailing market prices at\nthe time of the sale, at varying prices\ndetermined at the time of sale, or at\nnegotiated prices. These sales may be effected\nin transactions, which may involve cross or\nblock transactions. The Selling Shareholder\nmay also loan or pledge Shares to broker-\ndealers that in turn may sell such Shares, to\nthe extent permitted by applicable law. The\nSelling Shareholder may also enter into\noptions or other transactions with broker-\ndealers or other financial institutions or the\ncreation of one or more derivative securities\nwhich require the delivery to such broker-\ndealer or other financial institution of\nShares, which Shares such broker-dealer or\nother financial institution may resell. The\nSelling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or\nagents participating in the distribution of\nShares may be deemed to be \u201cunderwriters\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 2(11) of the\nSecurities Act in connection with such sales.\nIn such event, any commissions paid to any\nsuch broker-dealer or agent and any profit on\nthe resale of the Shares purchased by them may\nbe deemed to be underwriting commissions or\ndiscounts under the Securities Act. The\nSelling Shareholder who may be deemed an\n\u201cunderwriter\u201d within the meaning of Section\n2(11) of the Securities Act will be subject to\nthe applicable prospectus delivery\nrequirements of the Securities Act.\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK Counterparty risk with\nrespect to derivatives has been and may\ncontinue to be affected by new rules and\nregulations affecting the derivatives market.\nSome derivatives transactions are required to\nbe centrally cleared, and a party to a cleared\nderivatives transaction is subject to the\ncredit risk of the clearing house and the\nclearing member through which it holds its\ncleared position, rather than the credit risk\nof its original counterparty to the\nderivatives transaction. Credit risk of market\nparticipants with respect to derivatives that\nare centrally cleared is concentrated in a few\nclearing houses, and it is not clear how an\ninsolvency proceeding of a clearing house\nwould be conducted, what effect the insolvency\nproceeding would have on any recovery by the\nFund, and what impact an insolvency of a\nclearing house would have on the financial\nsystem more generally. FUTURES AND OPTIONS\nTRANSACTIONS There can be no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market will exist for any\nparticular futures contract or option at any\nspecific time. Thus, it may not be possible to\nclose a futures or options position. In the\nevent of adverse price movements, the Fund\nwould continue to be required to make daily\ncash payments to maintain its required margin.\nIn such situations, if the Fund has\ninsufficient cash, it may have to sell\nportfolio securities to meet daily margin\nrequirements at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous to do so. In addition, the\nFund may be required to make delivery of the\ninstruments underlying futures contracts it\nhas sold. The Fund will minimize the risk that\nit will be unable to close out a futures or\noptions contract by only entering into futures\nand options for which there appears to be a\nliquid secondary market. 14 Table of Contents\nThe risk of loss in trading futures contracts\nor uncovered call options in some strategies (\ne.g., selling uncovered index futures\ncontracts) is potentially unlimited. The Fund\ndoes not plan to use futures and options\ncontracts, when available, in this manner. The\nrisk of a futures position may still be large\nas traditionally measured due to the low\nmargin deposits required. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund, however, may utilize\nfutures and options contracts in a manner\ndesigned to limit its risk exposure to that\nwhich is comparable to what it would have\nincurred through direct investment in\nsecurities. Utilization of futures\ntransactions by the Fund involves the risk of\nimperfect or even negative correlation to its\nbenchmark Index if the index underlying the\nfutures contracts differs from the benchmark\nIndex or if the futures contracts do not track\nthe benchmark Index as expected. There is also\nthe risk of loss by the Fund of margin\ndeposits in the event of bankruptcy of a\nbroker with whom the Fund has an open position\nin the futures contract or option. Certain\nfinancial futures exchanges limit the amount\nof fluctuation permitted in futures contract\nprices during a single trading day. The daily\nlimit establishes the maximum amount that the\nprice of a futures contract may vary either up\nor down from the previous day\u2019s settlement\nprice at the end of a trading session. Once\nthe daily limit has been reached in a\nparticular type of contract, no trades may be\nmade on that day at a price beyond that limit.\nThe daily limit governs only price movement\nduring a particular trading day and therefore\ndoes not limit potential losses, because the\nlimit may prevent the liquidation of\nunfavorable positions. Futures contract prices\nhave occasionally moved to the daily limit for\nseveral consecutive trading days with little\nor no trading, thereby preventing prompt\nliquidation of futures positions and\nsubjecting some futures traders to substantial\nlosses. RISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS Swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nswap counterparty will default on its\nobligations. If such a default occurs, the\nFund will have contractual remedies pursuant\nto the agreements related to the transaction,\nbut such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy\nand insolvency laws which could affect the\nFund\u2019s rights as a creditor. The use of\ninterest-rate and index swaps is a highly\nspecialized activity that involves investment\ntechniques and risks different from those\nassociated with ordinary portfolio security\ntransactions. The use of a swap requires an\nunderstanding not only of the referenced\nasset, reference rate or index but also of the\nswap itself, without the benefit of observing\nthe performance of the swap under all possible\nmarket conditions. These transactions\ngenerally do not involve the delivery of\nsecurities or other underlying assets or\nprincipal. The absence of a regulated\nexecution facility or contract market and lack\nof liquidity for swap transactions has led, in\nsome instances, to difficulties in trading and\nvaluation, especially in the event of market\ndisruptions. Under recently adopted rules and\nregulations, transactions in some types of\nswaps are required to be centrally cleared. In\na cleared derivatives transaction, the Fund\u2019s\ncounterparty to the transaction is a central\nderivatives clearing organization, or clearing\nhouse, rather than a bank or broker. Because\nthe Fund is not a member of a clearing house,\nand only members of a clearing house can\nparticipate directly in the clearing house,\nthe Fund holds cleared derivatives through\naccounts at clearing members. In cleared\nderivatives transactions, the Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and\nreceive payments from a clearing house through\nits accounts at clearing members. Clearing\nmembers guarantee performance of their\nclients\u2019 obligations to the clearing house.\nCentrally cleared derivative arrangements may\nbe less favorable to the Fund than bilateral\n(non-cleared)arrangements. For example, the\nFund may be required to provide greater\namounts of margin for cleared derivatives\ntransactions than for bilateral derivatives\ntransactions. Also, in contrast to bilateral\nderivatives transactions, in some cases\nfollowing a period of notice to the Fund, a\nclearing member generally can require\ntermination of existing cleared derivatives\ntransactions at any time or an increase in\nmargin requirements above the margin that the\nclearing member required at the beginning of a\ntransaction. Clearing houses also have broad\nrights to increase margin requirements for\nexisting transactions or to terminate\ntransactions at any time. The Fund is subject\nto risk if it enters into a derivatives\ntransaction that is required to be cleared (or\nwhich SSGA FM expects to be cleared), and no\nclearing member is willing or able to clear\nthe transaction on the Fund\u2019s behalf. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be\nterminated, and the Fund could lose some or\nall of the benefit of the transaction,\nincluding loss of an increase in the value of\nthe transaction and loss of hedging\nprotection. In addition, the documentation\ngoverning the relationship between the Fund\nand clearing members is drafted by the\nclearing members and generally is less\nfavorable to the Fund than typical bilateral\nderivatives documentation. These clearing\nrules and other new rules and regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict the Fund\u2019s\nability to engage in, or increase the cost to\nthe Fund of, derivatives transactions, for\nexample, by making some types of derivatives\nno longer available to the Fund, increasing\nmargin or capital requirements, or otherwise\nlimiting liquidity or increasing transaction\ncosts. These regulations are new and evolving,\nso their potential impact on the Fund and the\nfinancial system are not yet known. Because\nthey are two party contracts that may be\nsubject to contractual restrictions on\ntransferability and termination and because\nthey may have terms of greater than seven\ndays, swap agreements may be considered to be\nilliquid and subject to the Fund\u2019s limitation\non investments in illiquid securities. To the\nextent that a swap is not liquid, it may not\nbe possible to initiate a transaction or\nliquidate a position at an advantageous time\nor price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Like most other investments, swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the\nmarket value of the instrument will change in\na way detrimental to the Fund\u2019s interest. 15\nTable of Contents If the Fund uses a swap as a\nhedge against, or as a substitute for, a\nportfolio investment, the Fund will be exposed\nto the risk that the swap will have or will\ndevelop imperfect or no correlation with the\nportfolio investment. This could cause\nsubstantial losses for the Fund. While hedging\nstrategies involving swap instruments can\nreduce the risk of loss, they can also reduce\nthe opportunity for gain or even result in\nlosses by offsetting favorable price movements\nin other Fund investments. Many swaps are\ncomplex and often valued subjectively. LIBOR\nRISK On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s\nFinancial Conduct Authority, which regulates\nLIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out\nLIBOR by the end of 2021. The replacement or\nabandonment of, or modification to, LIBOR\ncould have adverse impacts on newly issued\nfinancial instruments and existing financial\ninstruments which reference LIBOR. While some\ninstruments may contemplate a scenario where\nLIBOR is no longer available by providing for\nan alternative rate setting methodology, not\nall instruments may have such provisions and\nthere are significant uncertainty regarding\nthe effectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies. Abandonment of or modifications\nto LIBOR could lead to significant short-term\nand long-term uncertainty and market\ninstability. Instruments in which the Fund\ninvests may pay interest at floating or\nadjusting rates based on LIBOR or may be\nsubject to interest caps or floors. There\nremains uncertainty regarding the future\nutilization of LIBOR and the nature of any\nreplacement rate. The unavailability or\nreplacement of LIBOR may affect the value,\nliquidity or return on certain Fund\ninvestments and may result in costs incurred\nin connection with closing out positions and\nentering into new trades. Any pricing\nadjustments to the Fund\u2019s investments\nresulting from a substitute reference rate may\nalso adversely affect the Fund\u2019s performance\nand/or NAV. Such successor or substitute\nreference rate and any adjustments selected\nmay negatively impact the Fund\u2019s investments,\nperformance or financial condition, and may\nexpose the Fund to additional tax, accounting\nand regulatory risks, Additionally, if LIBOR\nceases to exist, the Fund may need to\nrenegotiate the credit agreements extending\nbeyond 2021 with the Fund\u2019s obligors that\nutilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the\ninterest rate and certain of the Fund\u2019s\nexisting credit facilities to replace LIBOR\nwith the new standard that is established. Any\npricing adjustments to the Fund\u2019s investments\nresulting from a substitute reference rate may\nalso adversely affect the Fund\u2019s performance\nand/or NAV. Such successor or substitute\nreference rate and any adjustments selected\nmay negatively impact the Fund\u2019s investments,\nperformance or financial condition, and may\nexpose the Fund to additional tax, accounting\nand regulatory risks. The U.S. Federal\nReserve, in conjunction with the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee, a steering\ncommittee comprised of large U.S. financial\ninstitutions, intends to replace the U.S.\ndollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight\nFunding Rate (SOFR), a new index calculated by\nshort-term repurchase agreements, backed by\nTreasury securities. Abandonment of or\nmodifications to LIBOR could have adverse\nimpacts on newly issued financial instruments\nand existing financial instruments which\nreference LIBOR. While some instruments may\ncontemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no\nlonger available by providing for an\nalternative rate setting methodology, not all\ninstruments may have such provisions and there\nare significant uncertainty regarding the\neffectiveness of any such alternative\nmethodologies. In 2012, regulators in the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom alleged\nthat some of the member banks surveyed by the\nBritish Bankers Association engaged in\nmanipulative acts in connection with the\ncalculation of LIBOR. Several financial\ninstitutions have reached settlements with the\nCFTC, the U.S. Department of Justice Fraud\nSection and the United Kingdom Financial\nConduct Authority in connection with\ninvestigations by such authorities into\nsubmissions made by such financial\ninstitutions to the bodies that set LIBOR and\nother interbank offered rates. Additional\ninvestigations remain ongoing with respect to\nother major banks. Despite increased\nregulation and other corrective actions since\nthat time, concerns have arisen regarding\nLIBOR\u2019s viability as a benchmark, due to\ndecreased confidence of the market in LIBOR\nand lead market participants looking for\nalternative, non-LIBORbased types of\nfinancing, such as fixed rate loans or bonds\nor floating rate loans based on non-\nLIBORindices. MARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING FROM\nCOVID-19 An outbreak of a respiratory disease\ncaused by a novel coronavirus first detected\nin China in December 2019 has spread globally\nin a short period of time. In an organized\nattempt to contain and mitigate the effects of\nthe spread of the coronavirus known as\nCOVID-19,governments and businesses world-wide\nhave taken aggressive measures, including\nclosing borders, restricting international and\ndomestic travel, and the imposition of\nprolonged quarantines of large populations.\nCOVID-19has resulted in the disruption of and\ndelays in the delivery of healthcare services\nand processes, the cancellation of organized\nevents and educational institutions, the\ndisruption of production and supply chains, a\ndecline in consumer demand for certain goods\nand services, and general concern and\nuncertainty, all of which have contributed to\nincreased volatility in global markets. The\neffects of COVID-19will likely affect certain\nsectors and industries more dramatically than\nothers, which may adversely affect the value\nof the Fund\u2019s investments in those sectors or\nindustries. COVID-19,and other epidemics and\npandemics that may arise in the future, could\nadversely affect the economies of many\nnations, the global economy, individual\ncompanies and capital markets in ways that\ncannot be foreseen at the present time. In\naddition, the impact of infectious diseases in\ndeveloping or emerging market countries may be\ngreater due to limited health care resources.\nPolitical, economic and social stresses caused\nby COVID-19also may exacerbate other pre-\nexistingpolitical, social and economic risks\nin certain countries. The duration of\nCOVID-19and its effects cannot be determined\nat this time, but the effects could be present\nfor an extended period of time. 16 Table of\nContents TAX RISKS As with any investment, you\nshould consider how your investment in Shares\nof the Fund will be taxed. The tax information\nin the Prospectus and this SAI is provided as\ngeneral information. You should consult your\nown tax professional about the tax\nconsequences of an investment in Shares of the\nFund. Unless your investment in Shares is made\nthrough a tax-advantagedretirement account,\nsuch as an individual retirement account, you\nneed to be aware of the possible tax\nconsequences when the Fund makes distributions\nor you sell Shares. INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS\nThe Trust has adopted the following investment\nrestrictions as fundamental policies with\nrespect to the Fund. These restrictions cannot\nbe changed without the approval of the holders\nof a majority of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. For purposes of the 1940 Act, a\nmajority of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund means the vote, at an annual or a\nspecial meeting of the security holders of the\nTrust, of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the\nvoting securities of the Fund present at such\nmeeting, if the holders of more than 50% of\nthe outstanding voting securities of the Fund\nare present or represented by proxy, or (2)\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of the Fund. Except with the\napproval of a majority of the outstanding\nvoting securities, the Fund may not: 1.\nConcentrate its investments in securities of\nissuers in the same industry, except as may be\nnecessary to approximate the composition of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying Index; 1 2. Make loans\nto another person except as permitted by the\n1940 Act or other governing statute, by the\nRules thereunder, or by the SEC or other\nregulatory agency with authority over the\nFund; 3. Issue senior securities or borrow\nmoney except as permitted by the 1940 Act or\nother governing statute, by the Rules\nthereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory\nagency with authority over the Fund; 4. Invest\ndirectly in real estate unless the real estate\nis acquired as a result of ownership of\nsecurities or other instruments. This\nrestriction shall not preclude the Fund from\ninvesting in companies that deal in real\nestate or in instruments that are backed or\nsecured by real estate; 5. Act as an\nunderwriter of another issuer\u2019s securities,\nexcept to the extent the Fund may be deemed to\nbe an underwriter within the meaning of the\nSecurities Act in connection with the Fund\u2019s\npurchase and sale of portfolio securities; or\n6. Invest in commodities except as permitted\nby the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by\nthe Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other\nregulatory agency with authority over the\nFund. In addition to the investment\nrestrictions adopted as fundamental policies\nas set forth above, the Fund observes the\nfollowing restrictions, which may be changed\nby the Board without a shareholder vote. The\nFund will not: 1. Invest in the securities of\na company for the purpose of exercising\nmanagement or control, provided that the Trust\nmay vote the investment securities owned by\nthe Fund in accordance with its views; 2.\nUnder normal circumstances, invest less than\n80% of its total assets in securities that\ncomprise the benchmark Index. Securities that\nhave economic characteristics substantially\nidentical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index are\nincluded within this 80% investment policy;\nand 3. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of\nborrowings for investment purposes, in U.S.\nTreasury bills. Prior to any change in the\nFund\u2019s 80% investment policy, the Fund will\nprovide shareholders with 60 days written\nnotice. The Fund defines the foregoing terms\nin accordance with the definition of such\nterms per the Index. If a percentage\nlimitation is adhered to at the time of\ninvestment or contract, a later increase or\ndecrease in percentage resulting from any\nchange in value or total or net assets will\nnot result in a violation of such restriction,\nexcept that the percentage limitations with\nrespect to the borrowing of money will be\nobserved continuously. With respect to the\nlimitation on borrowing, in the event that a\nsubsequent change in net assets or other\ncircumstances cause the Fund to exceed its\nlimitation, the Fund will take steps to bring\nthe aggregate amount of borrowing back within\nthe limitations within three days thereafter\n(not including Sundays and holidays).\n                                              \n     The SEC Staff considers concentration    \n  1  to involve more than 25% of a fund\u2019s     \n     assets to be invested in an industry or  \n     group of industries.                     \n                                              \n17 Table of Contents The 1940 Act currently\npermits the Fund to loan up to 33 1/3% of its\ntotal assets. With respect to borrowing, the\n1940 Act presently allows the Fund to: (1)\nborrow from any bank (including pledging,\nmortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an\namount up to 33 1/ 3% of its total assets, (2)\nborrow money for temporary purposes in an\namount not exceeding 5% of the value of the\nFund\u2019s total assets at the time of the loan,\nand (3) enter into reverse repurchase\nagreements. However, under normal\ncircumstances any borrowings by the Fund will\nnot exceed 10% of the Fund\u2019s total assets. The\n1940 Act generally prohibits funds from\nissuing senior securities, although it does\nnot treat certain transactions as senior\nsecurities, such as certain borrowings, short\nsales, reverse repurchase agreements, firm\ncommitment agreements and standby commitments,\nwith appropriate earmarking or segregation of\nassets to cover such obligation. With respect\nto investments in commodities, the 1940 Act\npresently permits the Fund to invest in\ncommodities in accordance with investment\npolicies contained in its prospectus and SAI.\nAny such investment shall also comply with the\nCEA and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe 1940 Act does not directly restrict an\ninvestment company\u2019s ability to invest in real\nestate, but does require that every investment\ncompany have the fundamental investment policy\ngoverning such investments. The Fund will not\npurchase or sell real estate, except that the\nFund may invest in companies that deal in real\nestate (including real estate investment\ntrusts (\u201cREITs\u201d)) or in instruments that are\nbacked or secured by real estate. EXCHANGE\nLISTING AND TRADING A discussion of exchange\nlisting and trading matters associated with an\ninvestment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus under \u201cPURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION\u201d and \u201cADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE\nINFORMATION.\u201d The discussion below\nsupplements, and should be read in conjunction\nwith, such sections of the Prospectus. The\nShares of the Fund are approved for listing\nand trading on the Exchange, subject to notice\nof issuance. The Shares trade on the Exchange\nat prices that may differ to some degree from\ntheir net asset value. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the\nExchange necessary to maintain the listing of\nShares of the Fund will continue to be met.\nThe Exchange may consider the suspension of\ntrading in, and may initiate delisting\nproceedings of, the Shares of the Fund under\nany of the following circumstances: (i) if any\nof the continued listing requirements set\nforth in the Exchange rules are not\ncontinuously maintained; (ii) if the Exchange\nfiles separate proposals under Section 19(b)\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, and any of the statements or\nrepresentations regarding (a) the description\nof the Index, portfolio, or reference asset;\n(b) limitations on the Index or the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings or reference assets; or (c)\nthe applicability of the Exchange listing\nrules specified in such proposals are not\ncontinuously maintained; (iii) if following\nthe initial 12-monthperiod beginning at the\ncommencement of trading of the Fund, there are\nfewer than 50 record or beneficial owners of\nthe Shares of the Fund; (iv) if the value of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying index or portfolio of\nsecurities on which the Fund is based is no\nlonger calculated or available; or (v) such\nother event shall occur or condition shall\nexist that, in the opinion of the Exchange,\nmakes further dealings on the Exchange\ninadvisable. If the Intraday Indicative Value\nof the Fund is not being disseminated as\nrequired by Exchange rules, the Exchange may\nhalt trading during the day in which such\ninterruption occurs. If the interruption\npersists past the trading day in which it\noccurred, the Exchange will halt trading in\nthe Shares. The Exchange will remove the\nShares from listing and trading upon\ntermination of the Fund. The Trust reserves\nthe right to adjust the Fund Share price of\nthe Fund in the future to maintain convenient\ntrading ranges for investors. Any adjustments\nwould be accomplished through stock splits or\nreverse stock splits, which would have no\neffect on the net assets of the Fund. The\nTrust reserves the right to adjust the Fund\nShare price of the Fund in the future to\nmaintain convenient trading ranges for\ninvestors. Any adjustments would be\naccomplished through stock splits or reverse\nstock splits, which would have no effect on\nthe net assets of the Fund. As in the case of\nother publicly traded securities, brokers\u2019\ncommissions on transactions will be based on\nnegotiated commission rates at customary\nlevels. The base and trading currencies of the\nFund is the U.S. dollar. The base currency is\nthe currency in which the Fund\u2019s net asset\nvalue per Share is calculated and the trading\ncurrency is the currency in which Shares of\nthe Fund are listed and traded on the\nExchange. 18 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT OF\nTHE TRUST The following information\nsupplements and should be read in conjunction\nwith the section in the Prospectus entitled\n\u201cMANAGEMENT.\u201d Board Responsibilities. The\nmanagement and affairs of the Trust and its\nseries, including the Fund described in this\nSAI, are overseen by the Trustees. The Board\nhas approved contracts, as described in this\nSAI, under which certain companies provide\nessential management services to the Trust.\nLike most mutual funds, the day-to-daybusiness\nof the Trust, including the management of\nrisk, is performed by third party service\nproviders, such as the Adviser, Distributor,\nAdministrator and Sub-Administrator.The\nTrustees are responsible for overseeing the\nTrust\u2019s service providers and, thus, have\noversight responsibility with respect to risk\nmanagement performed by those service\nproviders. Risk management seeks to identify\nand address risks, i.e., events or\ncircumstances that could have material adverse\neffects on the business, operations,\nshareholder services, investment performance\nor reputation of the Fund. The Fund and its\nservice providers employ a variety of\nprocesses, procedures and controls to identify\nvarious of those possible events or\ncircumstances, to lessen the probability of\ntheir occurrence and/or to mitigate the\neffects of such events or circumstances if\nthey do occur. Each service provider is\nresponsible for one or more discrete aspects\nof the Trust\u2019s business (e.g., the Adviser is\nresponsible for the day-to-daymanagement of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio investments) and,\nconsequently, for managing the risks\nassociated with that business. The Board has\nemphasized to the Fund\u2019s service providers the\nimportance of maintaining vigorous risk\nmanagement. The Trustees\u2019 role in risk\noversight begins before the inception of the\nFund, at which time the Fund\u2019s Adviser\npresents the Board with information concerning\nthe investment objectives, strategies and\nrisks of the Fund, as well as proposed\ninvestment limitations for the Fund.\nAdditionally, the Fund\u2019s Adviser provides the\nBoard with an overview of, among other things,\ntheir investment philosophies, brokerage\npractices and compliance infrastructures.\nThereafter, the Board continues its oversight\nfunction as various personnel, including the\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer, as well as\npersonnel of the Adviser and other service\nproviders, such as the Fund\u2019s independent\naccountants, make periodic reports to the\nAudit Committee or to the Board with respect\nto various aspects of risk management. The\nBoard and the Audit Committee oversee efforts\nby management and service providers to manage\nrisks to which the Fund may be exposed. The\nBoard is responsible for overseeing the\nnature, extent and quality of the services\nprovided to the Fund by the Adviser and\nreceives information about those services at\nits regular meetings. In addition, on an\nannual basis, in connection with its\nconsideration of whether to renew the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement with the\nAdviser, the Board meets with the Adviser to\nreview such services. Among other things, the\nBoard regularly considers the Adviser\u2019s\nadherence to the Fund\u2019s investment\nrestrictions and compliance with various Fund\npolicies and procedures and with applicable\nsecurities regulations. The Board also reviews\ninformation about the Fund\u2019s investments. The\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer reports\nregularly to the Board to review and discuss\ncompliance issues. At least annually, the\nTrust\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer provides the\nBoard with a report reviewing the adequacy and\neffectiveness of the Trust\u2019s policies and\nprocedures and those of its service providers,\nincluding the Adviser. The report addresses\nthe operation of the policies and procedures\nof the Trust and each service provider since\nthe date of the last report; any material\nchanges to the policies and procedures since\nthe date of the last report; any\nrecommendations for material changes to the\npolicies and procedures; and any material\ncompliance matters since the date of the last\nreport. The Board receives reports from the\nFund\u2019s service providers regarding operational\nrisks and risks related to the valuation and\nliquidity of portfolio securities. Regular\nreports are made to the Board concerning\ninvestments for which market quotations are\nnot readily available. Annually, the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nreviews with the Audit Committee its audit of\nthe Fund\u2019s financial statements, focusing on\nmajor areas of risk encountered by the Fund\nand noting any significant deficiencies or\nmaterial weaknesses in the Fund\u2019s internal\ncontrols. Additionally, in connection with its\noversight function, the Board oversees Fund\nmanagement\u2019s implementation of disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, which are designed to\nensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports\nwith the SEC are recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the required\ntime periods. The Board also oversees the\nTrust\u2019s internal controls over financial\nreporting, which comprise policies and\nprocedures designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of the\nTrust\u2019s financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Trust\u2019s financial\nstatements. From their review of these reports\nand discussions with the Adviser, the Chief\nCompliance Officer, the independent registered\npublic accounting firm and other service\nproviders, the Board and the Audit Committee\nlearn in detail about the material risks of\nthe Fund, thereby facilitating a dialogue\nabout how management and service providers\nidentify and mitigate those risks. 19 Table of\nContents The Board recognizes that not all\nrisks that may affect the Fund can be\nidentified and/or quantified, that it may not\nbe practical or cost-effective to eliminate or\nmitigate certain risks, that it may be\nnecessary to bear certain risks (such as\ninvestment-related risks) to achieve the\nFund\u2019s goals, and that the processes,\nprocedures and controls employed to address\ncertain risks may be limited in their\neffectiveness. Moreover, reports received by\nthe Trustees as to risk management matters are\ntypically summaries of the relevant\ninformation. Most of the Fund\u2019s investment\nmanagement and business affairs are carried\nout by or through the Fund\u2019s Adviser and other\nservice providers, each of which has an\nindependent interest in risk management but\nwhose policies and the methods by which one or\nmore risk management functions are carried out\nmay differ from the Fund\u2019s and each other\u2019s in\nthe setting of priorities, the resources\navailable or the effectiveness of relevant\ncontrols. As a result of the foregoing and\nother factors, the Board\u2019s ability to monitor\nand manage risk, as a practical matter, is\nsubject to limitations. Trustees and\nOfficers.There are seven members of the Board\nof Trustees, six of whom are not interested\npersons of the Trust, as that term is defined\nin the 1940 Act (\u201cIndependent Trustees\u201d).\nFrank Nesvet, an Independent Trustee, serves\nas Chairman of the Board. The Board has\ndetermined its leadership structure is\nappropriate given the specific characteristics\nand circumstances of the Trust. The Board made\nthis determination in consideration of, among\nother things, the fact that the Independent\nTrustees constitute a super-majority (greater\nthan 75%) of the Board, the fact that the\nchairperson of each Committee of the Board is\nan Independent Trustee, the amount of assets\nunder management in the Trust, and the number\nof funds (and classes of shares) overseen by\nthe Board. The Board also believes that its\nleadership structure facilitates the orderly\nand efficient flow of information to the\nIndependent Trustees from fund management. The\nBoard of Trustees has two standing committees:\nthe Audit Committee and Trustee Committee. The\nAudit Committee and Trustee Committee are each\nchaired by an Independent Trustee and composed\nof all of the Independent Trustees.

As of June 30, 2020,\nthe Adviser managed approximately $612.89\nbillion in assets. The Adviser\u2019s principal\naddress is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. The Adviser, a\nMassachusetts corporation, is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Global Advisors,\nInc., which is itself a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Corporation, a\npublicly held financial holding company. State\nStreet Global Advisors (\u201cSSGA\u201d), consisting of\nthe Adviser and other investment advisory\naffiliates of State Street Corporation, is the\ninvestment management arm of State Street\nCorporation. The Adviser serves as investment\nadviser to the Fund pursuant to an investment\nadvisory agreement (\u201cInvestment Advisory\nAgreement\u201d) between the Trust and the Adviser.\nThe Investment Advisory Agreement, with\nrespect to the Fund, continues in effect for\ntwo years from its effective date, and\nthereafter is subject to annual approval by\n(1) the Board or (2) vote of a majority of the\noutstanding voting securities (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Fund, provided that in\neither event such continuance also is approved\nby a majority of the Board who are not\ninterested persons (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Trust by a vote cast in person at\na meeting called for the purpose of voting on\nsuch approval. The Investment Advisory\nAgreement with respect to the Fund is\nterminable without penalty, on 60 days\u2019\nnotice, by the Board or by a vote of the\nholders of a majority (as defined in the 1940\nAct) of the Fund\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities. The Investment Advisory Agreement\nis also terminable upon 60 days\u2019 notice by the\nAdviser and will terminate automatically in\nthe event of its assignment (as defined in the\n1940 Act). Under the Investment Advisory\nAgreement, the Adviser, subject to the\noversight of the Board and in conformity with\nthe stated investment policies of the Fund,\nmanages the investment of the Fund\u2019s assets.\nThe Adviser is responsible for placing\npurchase and sale orders and providing\ncontinuous supervision of the investment\nportfolio of the Fund. Pursuant to the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is\nnot liable for certain liabilities, including\ncertain liabilities arising under the federal\nsecurities laws, unless such loss or liability\nresults from willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its\nobligations and duties. For the services\nprovided to the Fund under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser\nmonthly fees based on a percentage of the\nFund\u2019s average daily net assets as set forth\nin the Fund\u2019s Prospectus. From time to time,\nthe Adviser may waive all or a portion of its\nfee. The Adviser pays all expenses of the Fund\nother than the management fee, brokerage,\ntaxes, interest, fees and expenses of the\nIndependent Trustees (including any Trustee\u2019s\ncounsel fees), acquired fund fees and\nexpenses, litigation expenses and other\nextraordinary expenses. A summary of the\nfactors considered by the Board of Trustees in\nconnection with the initial approval of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement for the Fund\nwill be available in the Fund\u2019s first\nshareholder report after the Fund commences\noperations. The Fund had not commenced\noperations as of the date of this SAI and\ntherefore did not pay fees to the Adviser for\nthe past three fiscal years. From time to\ntime, the Adviser may waive all or a portion\nof its fee. The Adviser has contractually\nagreed to waive a portion of its management\nfee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount\nequal to any acquired fund fees and expenses\n(excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash\nmanagement purposes, if any) for the Fund\nuntil October 31, 2021. This contractual fee\nwaiver and/or reimbursement does not provide\nfor the recoupment by the Adviser of any fees\nthe Adviser previously waived. The Adviser may\ncontinue the waiver and/or reimbursement from\nyear to year, but there is no guarantee that\nthe Adviser will do so and the waiver and/or\nreimbursement may be cancelled or modified at\nany time after October 31, 2021. The waiver\nand/or reimbursement may not be terminated\nprior to October 31, 2021 except with the\napproval of the Board. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS The\nAdviser manages the Fund using a team of\ninvestment professionals. The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-\ndayportfolio management of the Fund are Todd\nBean, Sean Lussier and April Borawski. The\nfollowing table lists the number and types of\naccounts managed by each of the key\nprofessionals involved in the day-to-\ndayportfolio management for the Fund and\nassets under management in those accounts. The\ntotal number of accounts and assets have been\nallocated to each respective manager.\nTherefore, some accounts and assets have been\ncounted twice. 29 Table of Contents Other\nAccounts Managed as of June 30, 2020:\n                                              \n                  \u2026                           \n      \u2026           \u2026                           \n      \u2026           \u2026      \u2026                    \n      \u2026           \u2026      \u2026                    \n      \u2026           \u2026      \u2026                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      \u2026    $      \u2026      \u2026        $      $    \n      \u2026    $      \u2026      \u2026        $      $    \n      \u2026    $      \u2026      \u2026        $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  *  There are no performance-based fees      \n     associated with these accounts.          \n                                              \nThe Fund had not commenced operations prior to\nthe date of this SAI and therefore the\nportfolio managers did not beneficially own\nany Shares. A portfolio manager that has\nresponsibility for managing more than one\naccount may be subject to potential conflicts\nof interest because he or she is responsible\nfor other accounts in addition to the Fund.\nThose conflicts could include preferential\ntreatment of one account over others in terms\nof: (a) the portfolio manager\u2019s execution of\ndifferent investment strategies for various\naccounts or (b) the allocation of resources or\nof investment opportunities. Portfolio\nmanagers may manage numerous accounts for\nmultiple clients. These accounts may include\nregistered investment companies, other types\nof pooled accounts ( e.g., collective\ninvestment funds), and separate accounts (\ni.e., accounts managed on behalf of\nindividuals or public or private\ninstitutions). Portfolio managers make\ninvestment decisions for each account based on\nthe investment objectives and policies and\nother relevant investment considerations\napplicable to that portfolio. A potential\nconflict of interest may arise as a result of\nthe portfolio managers\u2019 responsibility for\nmultiple accounts with similar investment\nguidelines. Under these circumstances, a\npotential investment may be suitable for more\nthan one of the portfolio managers\u2019 accounts,\nbut the quantity of the investment available\nfor purchase is less than the aggregate amount\nthe accounts would ideally devote to the\nopportunity. Similar conflicts may arise when\nmultiple accounts seek to dispose of the same\ninvestment. The portfolio managers may also\nmanage accounts whose objectives and policies\ndiffer from that of the Fund. These\ndifferences may be such that under certain\ncircumstances, trading activity appropriate\nfor one account managed by the portfolio\nmanager may have adverse consequences for\nanother account managed by the portfolio\nmanager. For example, an account may sell a\nsignificant position in a security, which\ncould cause the market price of that security\nto decrease, while the Fund maintained its\nposition in that security. A potential\nconflict may arise when the portfolio managers\nare responsible for accounts that have\ndifferent advisory fees\u2014the difference in fees\ncould create an incentive for the portfolio\nmanager to favor one account over another, for\nexample, in terms of access to investment\nopportunities. Another potential conflict may\narise when the portfolio manager has an\ninvestment in one or more accounts that\nparticipate in transactions with other\naccounts. His or her investment(s) may create\nan incentive for the portfolio manager to\nfavor one account over another. The Adviser\nhas adopted policies and procedures reasonably\ndesigned to address these potential material\nconflicts. For instance, portfolio managers\nare normally responsible for all accounts\nwithin a certain investment discipline, and do\nnot, absent special circumstances,\ndifferentiate among the various accounts when\nallocating resources. Additionally, the\nAdviser and its advisory affiliates have\nprocesses and procedures for allocating\ninvestment opportunities among portfolios that\nare designed to provide a fair and equitable\nallocation. SSGA\u2019s culture is complemented and\nreinforced by a total rewards strategy that is\nbased on a pay for performance philosophy\nwhich seeks to offer a competitive pay mix of\nbase salary, benefits, cash incentives and\ndeferred compensation. Salary is based on a\nnumber of factors, including external\nbenchmarking data and market trends, State\nStreet performance, SSGA performance, and\nindividual overall performance. SSGA\u2019s Global\nHuman Resources department regularly\nparticipates in compensation surveys in order\nto provide SSGA with market-based compensation\ninformation that helps support individual pay\ndecisions. Additionally, subject to State\nStreet and SSGA business results, State Street\nallocates an incentive pool to SSGA to reward\nits employees. The size of the incentive pool\nfor most business units is based on the firm\u2019s\noverall profitability and other factors,\nincluding performance against risk-related\ngoals. For most SSGA investment teams, SSGA\nrecognizes and rewards performance by linking\nannual incentive decisions for investment\nteams to the firm\u2019s or business unit\u2019s\nprofitability and business unit investment\nperformance over a multi-year period. 30 Table\nof Contents Incentive pool funding for most\nactive investment teams is driven in part by\nthe post-taxinvestment performance of fund(s)\nmanaged by the team versus the return levels\nof the benchmark index(es) of the fund(s) on a\none-,three- and, in some cases, five-year\nbasis. For most active investment teams, a\nmaterial portion of incentive compensation for\nsenior staff is deferred over a four-year\nperiod into the SSGA Long-Term Incentive\n(\u201cSSGA LTI\u201d) program. For these teams, The\nSSGA LTI program indexes the performance of\nthese deferred awards against the post-\ntaxinvestment performance of fund(s) managed\nby the team. This is intended to align our\ninvestment team\u2019s compensation with client\ninterests, both through annual incentive\ncompensation awards and through the long-term\nvalue of deferred awards in the SSGA LTI\nprogram. For the passive equity investment\nteam, incentive pool funding is driven in part\nby the post-tax1 and 3-yeartracking error of\nthe funds managed by the team against the\nbenchmark indexes of the funds. The\ndiscretionary allocation of the incentive pool\nto the business units within SSGA is\ninfluenced by market-based compensation data,\nas well as the overall performance of each\nbusiness unit. Individual compensation\ndecisions are made by the employee\u2019s manager,\nin conjunction with the senior management of\nthe employee\u2019s business unit. These decisions\nare based on the overall performance of the\nemployee and, as mentioned above, on the\nperformance of the firm and business unit.\nDepending on the job level, a portion of the\nannual incentive may be awarded in deferred\ncompensation, which may include cash and/or\nDeferred Stock Awards (State Street stock),\nwhich typically vest over a four-year period.\nThis helps to retain staff and further aligns\nSSGA employees\u2019 interests with SSGA clients\u2019\nand shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.

Purchases and sales of\nsecurities on a securities exchange are\naffected through brokers who charge a\ncommission for their services. Ordinarily\ncommissions are not charged on over the\ncounter orders (e.g., fixed income securities)\nbecause the Fund pays a spread which is\nincluded in the cost of the security and\nrepresents the difference between the dealer\u2019s\nquoted price at which it is willing to sell\nthe security and the dealer\u2019s quoted price at\nwhich it is willing to buy the security. When\nthe Fund executes an over the counter order\nwith an electronic communications network or\nan alternative trading system, a commission is\ncharged because electronic communications\nnetworks and alternative trading systems\nexecute such orders on an agency basis.\nSecurities may be purchased from underwriters\nat prices that include underwriting fees. In\nplacing a portfolio transaction, the Adviser\nseeks to achieve best execution. The Adviser\u2019s\nduty to seek best execution requires the\nAdviser to take reasonable steps to obtain for\nthe client as favorable an overall result as\npossible for Fund portfolio transactions under\nthe circumstances, taking into account various\nfactors that are relevant to the particular\ntransaction. The Adviser refers to and selects\nfrom the list of approved trading\ncounterparties maintained by the Adviser\u2019s\nCredit Risk Management team. In selecting a\ntrading counterparty for a particular trade,\nthe Adviser seeks to weigh relevant factors\nincluding, but not limited to the following:\n                                       \n  \u2022    Prompt and reliable execution;  \n                                       \n                                              \n  \u2022    The competitiveness of commission      \n       rates and spreads, if applicable;      \n                                              \n                                              \n       The financial strength, stability      \n  \u2022    and/or reputation of the trading       \n       counterparty;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       The willingness and ability of the     \n       executing trading counterparty to      \n  \u2022    execute transactions (and commit       \n       capital) of size in liquid and         \n       illiquid markets without disrupting    \n       the market for the security;           \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Local laws, regulations or             \n       restrictions;                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       The ability of the trading             \n  \u2022    counterparty to maintain               \n       confidentiality;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n       The availability and capability of     \n       execution venues, including            \n  \u2022    electronic communications networks     \n       for trading and execution management   \n       systems made available to Adviser;     \n                                              \n                      \n  \u2022    Market share;  \n                      \n                   \n  \u2022    Liquidity;  \n                   \n               \n  \u2022    Price;  \n               \n                                 \n  \u2022    Execution related costs;  \n                                 \n                                        \n  \u2022    History of execution of orders;  \n                                        \n                                              \n  \u2022    Likelihood of execution and            \n       settlement;                            \n                                              \n                               \n  \u2022    Order size and nature;  \n                               \n                                              \n       Clearing and settlement capabilities,  \n  \u2022    especially in high volatility market   \n       environments;                          \n                                              \n                                             \n  \u2022    Availability of lendable securities;  \n                                             \n                                              \n       Sophistication of the trading          \n  \u2022    counterparty\u2019s trading capabilities    \n       and infrastructure/facilities;         \n                                              \n                                              \n       The operational efficiency with which  \n  \u2022    transactions are processed and         \n       cleared, taking into account the       \n       order size and complexity;             \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022    Speed and responsiveness to the        \n       Adviser;                               \n                                              \n                                     \n  \u2022    Access to secondary markets;  \n                                     \n                                   \n  \u2022    Counterparty exposure; and  \n                                   \n                                              \n       Any other consideration the Adviser    \n  \u2022    believes is relevant to the execution  \n       of the order.                          \n                                              \nIn selecting a trading counterparty, the price\nof the transaction and costs related to the\nexecution of the transaction typically merit a\nhigh relative importance, depending on the\ncircumstances. The Adviser does not\nnecessarily select a trading counterparty\nbased upon price and costs but may take other\nrelevant factors into account if it believes\nthat these are important in taking reasonable\nsteps to obtain the best possible result for\nthe Fund under the circumstances.\nConsequently, the Adviser may cause a client\nto pay a trading counterparty more than\nanother trading counterparty might have\ncharged for the same transaction in\nrecognition of the value and quality of the\nbrokerage services provided. The following\nmatters may influence the relative importance\nthat the Adviser places upon the relevant\nfactors: 33 Table of Contents (i) The nature\nand characteristics of the order or\ntransaction. For example, size of order,\nmarket impact of order, limits, or other\ninstructions relating to the order; (ii) The\ncharacteristics of the financial instrument(s)\nor other assets which are the subject of that\norder. For example, whether the order pertains\nto an equity, fixed income, derivative or\nconvertible instrument; (iii) The\ncharacteristics of the execution venues to\nwhich that order can be directed, if relevant.\nFor example, availability and capabilities of\nelectronic trading systems; (iv) Whether the\ntransaction is a \u2018delivery versus payment\u2019 or\n\u2018over the counter\u2019 transaction. The\ncreditworthiness of the trading counterparty,\nthe amount of existing exposure to a trading\ncounterparty and trading counterparty\nsettlement capabilities may be given a higher\nrelative importance in the case of \u2018over the\ncounter\u2019 transactions; and (v) Any other\ncircumstances relevant the Adviser believes is\nrelevant at the time. The process by which\ntrading counterparties are selected to effect\ntransactions is designed to exclude\nconsideration of the sales efforts conducted\nby broker-dealers in relation to the Fund. The\nAdviser does not currently use the Fund\u2019s\nassets in connection with third party soft\ndollar arrangements. While the Adviser does\nnot currently use \u201csoft\u201d or commission dollars\npaid by the Fund for the purchase of third\nparty research, the Adviser reserves the right\nto do so in the future. The Fund had not\ncommenced operations as of the date of this\nSAI and therefore did not pay brokerage\ncommissions during the past three fiscal\nyears. Securities of \u201cRegular Broker-Dealers.\u201d\nThe Fund is required to identify any\nsecurities of its \u201cregular brokers and\ndealers\u201d (as such term is defined in the 1940\nAct) which it may hold at the close of its\nmost recent fiscal year. \u201cRegular brokers or\ndealers\u201d of the Trust are the ten brokers or\ndealers that, during the most recent fiscal\nyear: (i) received the greatest dollar amounts\nof brokerage commissions from the Trust\u2019s\nportfolio transactions; (ii) engaged as\nprincipal in the largest dollar amounts of\nportfolio transactions of the Trust; or (iii)\nsold the largest dollar amounts of the Trust\u2019s\nshares. The Fund had not commenced operations\nas of the date of this SAI and therefore did\nnot have any holdings in Securities of Regular\nBroker-Dealers as of June 30, 2020. Portfolio\nTurnover. Portfolio turnover may vary from\nyear to year, as well as within a year. High\nturnover rates are likely to result in\ncomparatively greater brokerage expenses or\ntransaction costs. The overall reasonableness\nof brokerage commissions and transaction costs\nis evaluated by the Adviser based upon its\nknowledge of available information as to the\ngeneral level of commissions and transaction\ncosts paid by other institutional investors\nfor comparable services. BOOK ENTRY ONLY\nSYSTEM The following information supplements\nand should be read in conjunction with the\nsection in the Prospectus entitled \u201cADDITIONAL\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION.\u201d The Depository\nTrust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) acts as securities\ndepositary for the Shares. Shares of the Fund\nare represented by securities registered in\nthe name of DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co.,\nand deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.\nExcept in the limited circumstance provided\nbelow, certificates will not be issued for\nShares. DTC, a limited-purpose trust company,\nwas created to hold securities of its\nparticipants (the \u201cDTC Participants\u201d) and to\nfacilitate the clearance and settlement of\nsecurities transactions among the DTC\nParticipants in such securities through\nelectronic book-entry changes in accounts of\nthe DTC Participants, thereby eliminating the\nneed for physical movement of securities\ncertificates. DTC Participants include\nsecurities brokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations and certain\nother organizations, some of whom (and/or\ntheir representatives) own DTC. More\nspecifically, DTC is owned by a number of its\nDTC Participants and by the New York Stock\nExchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and FINRA. Access to the DTC\nsystem is also available to others such as\nbanks, brokers, dealers and trust companies\nthat clear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a DTC Participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly (the \u201cIndirect\nParticipants\u201d). 34 Table of Contents\nBeneficial ownership of Shares is limited to\nDTC Participants, Indirect Participants and\npersons holding interests through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in Shares\n(owners of such beneficial interests are\nreferred to herein as \u201cBeneficial Owners\u201d) is\nshown on, and the transfer of ownership is\neffected only through, records maintained by\nDTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on\nthe records of DTC Participants (with respect\nto Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners\nthat are not DTC Participants). Beneficial\nOwners will receive from or through the DTC\nParticipant a written confirmation relating to\ntheir purchase of Shares. Conveyance of all\nnotices, statements and other communications\nto Beneficial Owners is effected as follows.\nPursuant to the Depositary Agreement between\nthe Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make\navailable to the Trust upon request and for a\nfee to be charged to the Trust a listing of\nthe Shares of the Fund held by each DTC\nParticipant. The Trust, either directly or\nthrough a third party service, shall inquire\nof each such DTC Participant as to the number\nof Beneficial Owners holding Shares, directly\nor indirectly, through such DTC Participant.\nThe Trust, either directly or through a third\nparty service, shall provide each such DTC\nParticipant with copies of such notice,\nstatement or other communication, in such\nform, number and at such place as such DTC\nParticipant may reasonably request, in order\nthat such notice, statement or communication\nmay be transmitted by such DTC Participant,\ndirectly or indirectly, to such Beneficial\nOwners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to\neach such DTC Participant and/or third party\nservice a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to\nsuch transmittal, all subject to applicable\nstatutory and regulatory requirements. Share\ndistributions shall be made to DTC or its\nnominee, Cede & Co., as the registered holder\nof all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon\nreceipt of any such distributions, shall\ncredit immediately DTC Participants\u2019 accounts\nwith payments in amounts proportionate to\ntheir respective beneficial interests in\nShares of the Fund as shown on the records of\nDTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC\nParticipants to Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners of Shares held through such\nDTC Participants will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is\nnow the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in bearer form or\nregistered in a \u201cstreet name,\u201d and will be the\nresponsibility of such DTC Participants. The\nTrust has no responsibility or liability for\nany aspects of the records relating to or\nnotices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made\non account of beneficial ownership interests\nin such Shares, or for maintaining,\nsupervising or reviewing any records relating\nto such beneficial ownership interests or for\nany other aspect of the relationship between\nDTC and the DTC Participants or the\nrelationship between such DTC Participants and\nthe Indirect Participants and Beneficial\nOwners owning through such DTC Participants.\nDTC may determine to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to Shares at any time by\ngiving reasonable notice to the Trust and\ndischarging its responsibilities with respect\nthereto under applicable law. Under such\ncircumstances, the Trust shall take action\neither to find a replacement for DTC to\nperform its functions at a comparable cost or,\nif such a replacement is unavailable, to issue\nand deliver printed certificates representing\nownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes\nother arrangements with respect thereto\nsatisfactory to the Exchange. CONTROL PERSONS\nAND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF SECURITIES The Fund\nhad not commenced operations prior to the date\nof this SAI and therefore did not have any\nbeneficial owners that owned greater than 5%\nof the outstanding voting securities as of the\ndate of this SAI. An Authorized Participant\n(as defined below) may hold of record more\nthan 25% of the outstanding Shares. From time\nto time, Authorized Participants may be a\nbeneficial and/or legal owner of the Fund, may\nbe affiliated with an index provider, may be\ndeemed to have control of the Fund and/or may\nbe able to affect the outcome of matters\npresented for a vote of the shareholders of\nthe Fund. Authorized Participants may execute\nan irrevocable proxy granting the Distributor\nor another affiliate of State Street (the\n\u201cAgent\u201d) power to vote or abstain from voting\nsuch Authorized Participant\u2019s beneficially or\nlegally owned Shares. In such cases, the Agent\nshall mirror vote (or abstain from voting)\nsuch Shares in the same proportion as all\nother beneficial owners of the Fund. The\nTrustees and Officers of the Trust, as a\ngroup, own less than 1% of the Trust\u2019s voting\nsecurities as of the date of this SAI.\nPURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS The\nFund issues and redeems its Shares on a\ncontinuous basis, at net asset value, only in\na large specified number of Shares called a\n\u201cCreation Unit,\u201d either principally in-kindfor\nsecurities included in the Index or in cash\nfor the value of such securities. The value of\nthe Fund is determined once each business day,\nas described under \u201cDetermination of Net Asset\nValue.\u201d A Creation Unit of the Fund consists\nof 50,000 Shares, but may change. Authorized\nParticipants (as defined below) will be\nnotified of such change. The principal\nconsideration for creations and redemptions\nfor the Fund is in-kind,although this may be\nrevised at any time without notice. PURCHASE\n(CREATION). The Trust issues and sells Shares\nof the Fund only in Creation Units on a\ncontinuous basis through the Principal\nUnderwriter, without a sales load (but subject\nto transaction fees), at their NAV per share\nnext determined after receipt of an order, on\nany Business Day (as defined below), in proper\nform pursuant to the terms of the Authorized\nParticipant Agreement (\u201cParticipant\nAgreement\u201d). A \u201cBusiness Day\u201d with respect to\nthe Fund is, generally, any day on which the\nNYSE is open for business, plus Veterans Day\nand Columbus Day. 35 Table of Contents FUND\nDEPOSIT. The consideration for purchase of a\nCreation Unit of the Fund generally consists\nof either (i) the in- kind deposit of a\ndesignated portfolio of securities (the\n\u201cDeposit Securities\u201d) per each Creation Unit\nconstituting a substantial replication, or a\nportfolio sampling representation, of the\nsecurities included in the Fund\u2019s benchmark\nIndex and the Cash Component (defined below),\ncomputed as described below or (ii) the cash\nvalue of the Deposit Securities (\u201cDeposit\nCash\u201d) and \u201cCash Component,\u201d computed as\ndescribed below. When accepting purchases of\nCreation Units for cash, the Fund may incur\nadditional costs associated with the\nacquisition of Deposit Securities that would\notherwise be provided by an in-kindpurchaser.\nTogether, the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, and the Cash Component\nconstitute the \u201cFund Deposit,\u201d which\nrepresents the minimum initial and subsequent\ninvestment amount for a Creation Unit of the\nFund. The \u201cCash Component\u201d which may include a\nDividend Equivalent Payment, is an amount\nequal to the difference between the net asset\nvalue of the Shares (per Creation Unit) and\nthe market value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable. The \u201cDividend\nEquivalent Payment\u201d enables the Fund to make a\ncomplete distribution of dividends on the day\npreceding the next dividend payment date, and\nis an amount equal, on a per Creation Unit\nbasis, to the dividends on all the portfolio\nsecurities of the Fund (\u201cDividend Securities\u201d)\nwith ex-dividenddates within the accumulation\nperiod for such distribution (the\n\u201cAccumulation Period\u201d), net of expenses and\nliabilities for such period, as if all of the\nDividend Securities had been held by the Fund\nfor the entire Accumulation Period. The\nAccumulation Period begins on the ex-\ndividenddate for the Fund and ends on the day\npreceding the next ex-dividenddate. If the\nCash Component is a positive number ( i.e.,\nthe net asset value per Creation Unit exceeds\nthe market value of the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash\nComponent shall be such positive amount. If\nthe Cash Component is a negative number (\ni.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit is\nless than the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),\nthe Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to\nreceive cash in an amount equal to the Cash\nComponent. The Cash Component serves the\nfunction of compensating for any differences\nbetween the net asset value per Creation Unit\nand the market value of the Deposit Securities\nor Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of\nthe Cash Component excludes any stamp duty or\nother similar fees and expenses payable upon\ntransfer of beneficial ownership of the\nDeposit Securities, if applicable, which shall\nbe the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below). The Custodian,\nthrough NSCC, makes available on each Business\nDay, prior to the opening of business on the\nNYSE (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time), the\nlist of the names and the required number of\nshares of each Deposit Security or the\nrequired amount of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, to be included in the current Fund\nDeposit (based on information at the end of\nthe previous Business Day) for the Fund. Such\nFund Deposit is subject to any applicable\nadjustments as described below, in order to\neffect purchases of Creation Units of the Fund\nuntil such time as the next-announced\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities or the\nrequired amount of Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, is made available. The identity\nand number of shares of the Deposit Securities\nor the amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable,\nrequired for a Fund Deposit for the Fund\nchanges as rebalancing adjustments, interest\npayments and corporate action events are\nreflected from time to time by the Adviser\nwith a view to the investment objective of the\nFund. Information regarding a Fund Deposit\nnecessary for the purchase of a Creation Unit\nis made available to Authorized Participants\nand other market participants seeking to\ntransact in Creation Unit aggregations. The\ncomposition of the Deposit Securities may also\nchange in response to adjustments to the\nweighting or composition of the component\nsecurities of the Fund\u2019s Index. As noted\nabove, the Trust reserves the right to permit\nor require the substitution of Deposit Cash to\nreplace any Deposit Security, which shall be\nadded to the Cash Component, including,\nwithout limitation, in situations where the\nDeposit Security: (i) may not be available in\nsufficient quantity for delivery, (ii) may not\nbe eligible for transfer through the systems\nof DTC for corporate securities and municipal\nsecurities or the Federal Reserve System for\nU.S. Treasury securities; (iii) may not be\neligible for trading by an Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below) or the investor\nfor which it is acting; (iv) would be\nrestricted under the securities laws or where\nthe delivery of the Deposit Security to the\nAuthorized Participant would result in the\ndisposition of the Deposit Security by the\nAuthorized Participant becoming restricted\nunder the securities laws, or (v) in certain\nother situations (collectively, \u201cnon-\nstandardorders\u201d). The Trust also reserves the\nright to: (i) permit or require the\nsubstitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of\nDeposit Cash; and (ii) include or remove\nDeposit Securities from the basket in\nanticipation of Index rebalancing changes. The\nadjustments described above will reflect\nchanges, known to the Adviser on the date of\nannouncement to be in effect by the time of\ndelivery of the Fund Deposit, in the\ncomposition of the subject Index being tracked\nby the Fund or resulting from certain\ncorporate actions. PROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF\nCREATION UNITS. To be eligible to place orders\nwith the Principal Underwriter, as facilitated\nvia the Transfer Agent, to purchase a Creation\nUnit of the Fund, an entity must be (i) a\n\u201cParticipating Party\u201d, i.e., a broker-dealer\nor other participant in the clearing process\nthrough the Continuous Net Settlement System\nof the NSCC (the \u201cClearing Process\u201d), a\nclearing agency that is registered with the\nSEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see \u201cBOOK\nENTRY ONLY SYSTEM\u201d) and have the ability to\nclear through the Federal Reserve System. In\naddition, each Participating Party or DTC\nParticipant (each, an \u201cAuthorized\nParticipant\u201d) must execute a Participant\nAgreement that has been agreed to by the\nPrincipal Underwriter and the Transfer 36\nTable of Contents Agent, and that has been\naccepted by the Trust, with respect to\npurchases and redemptions of Creation Units.\nEach Authorized Participant will agree,\npursuant to the terms of a Participant\nAgreement, on behalf of itself or any investor\non whose behalf it will act, to certain\nconditions, including that it will pay to the\nTrust, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the\nCash Component together with the creation\ntransaction fee (described below) and any\nother applicable fees, taxes and additional\nvariable charge. All orders to purchase Shares\ndirectly from the Fund, including non-\nstandardorders, must be placed for one or more\nCreation Units and in the manner and by the\ntime set forth in the Participant Agreement\nand/or the applicable order form. The date on\nwhich an order to purchase Creation Units (or\nan order to redeem Creation Units, as set\nforth below) is received and accepted is\nreferred to as the \u201cOrder Placement Date.\u201d An\nAuthorized Participant may require an investor\nto make certain representations or enter into\nagreements with respect to the order ( e.g.,\nto provide for payments of cash, when\nrequired). Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not have executed\na Participant Agreement and that, therefore,\norders to purchase Shares directly from the\nFund in Creation Units have to be placed by\nthe investor\u2019s broker through an Authorized\nParticipant that has executed a Participant\nAgreement. In such cases there may be\nadditional charges to such investor. At any\ngiven time, there may be only a limited number\nof broker-dealers that have executed a\nParticipant Agreement and only a small number\nof such Authorized Participants may have\ninternational capabilities. On days when the\nExchange or the bond markets close earlier\nthan normal, the Fund may require orders to\ncreate Creation Units to be placed earlier in\nthe day. In addition, if a market or markets\non which the Fund\u2019s investments are primarily\ntraded is closed, the Fund will also generally\nnot accept orders on such day(s). Orders must\nbe transmitted by an Authorized Participant by\ntelephone or other transmission method\nacceptable to the Distributor pursuant to\nprocedures set forth in the Participant\nAgreement and in accordance with the\napplicable order form. Those placing orders\nthrough an Authorized Participant should allow\nsufficient time to permit proper submission of\nthe purchase order by the cut-offtime.\nEconomic or market disruptions or changes, or\ntelephone or other communication failure may\nimpede the ability to reach the Distributor or\nan Authorized Participant. Fund Deposits must\nbe delivered by an Authorized Participant\nthrough the Federal Reserve System (for cash\nand U.S. government securities), or through\nDTC (for corporate securities and municipal\nsecurities), through a subcustody agent (for\nforeign securities) and/or through such other\narrangements allowed by the Trust or its\nagents. With respect to foreign Deposit\nSecurities, the Custodian shall cause the\nsubcustodian of the Fund to maintain an\naccount into which the Authorized Participant\nshall deliver, on behalf of itself or the\nparty on whose behalf it is acting, such\nDeposit Securities. Foreign Deposit Securities\nmust be delivered to an account maintained at\nthe applicable local subcustodian. The Fund\nDeposit transfer must be ordered by the\nAuthorized Participant in a timely fashion so\nas to ensure the delivery of the requisite\nnumber of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash,\nas applicable, to the account of the Fund or\nits agents by no later than the Settlement\nDate. The \u201cSettlement Date\u201d for the Fund is\ngenerally the second Business Day (\u201cT+2\u201d)\nafter the Order Placement Date. All questions\nas to the number of Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable,\nand the validity, form and eligibility\n(including time of receipt) for the deposit of\nany tendered securities or cash, as\napplicable, will be determined by the Trust,\nwhose determination shall be final and\nbinding. The amount of cash represented by the\nCash Component must be transferred directly to\nthe Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank\nwire transfer system in a timely manner so as\nto be received by the Custodian no later than\nthe Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and\nthe Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, are not received in a timely\nmanner by the Settlement Date, the creation\norder may be cancelled. Upon written notice to\nthe Distributor, such canceled order may be\nresubmitted the following Business Day using a\nFund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect\nthe then current NAV of the Fund. The delivery\nof Creation Units so created generally will\noccur no later than the second Business Day\nfollowing the day on which the purchase order\nis deemed received by the Distributor. The\norder shall be deemed to be received on the\nBusiness Day on which the order is placed\nprovided that the order is placed in proper\nform prior to the applicable cut-offtime and\nthe federal funds in the appropriate amount\nare deposited by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions),\nwith the Custodian on the Settlement Date. If\nthe order is not placed in proper form as\nrequired, or federal funds in the appropriate\namount are not received by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00\np.m. Eastern time (per applicable\ninstructions) on the Settlement Date, then the\norder may be deemed to be rejected and the\nAuthorized Participant shall be liable to the\nFund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom.\nA creation request is considered to be in\n\u201cproper form\u201d if all procedures set forth in\nthe Participant Agreement, order form and this\nSAI are properly followed. ISSUANCE OF A\nCREATION UNIT. Except as provided herein,\nCreation Units will not be issued until the\ntransfer of good title to the Trust of the\nDeposit Securities or payment of Deposit Cash,\nas applicable, and the payment of the Cash\nComponent have been completed. When the\nsubcustodian has confirmed to the Custodian\nthat the required Deposit Securities (or the\ncash value thereof) have been delivered to the\naccount of the relevant subcustodian or\nsubcustodians, the Principal Underwriter and\nthe Adviser shall be notified of such\ndelivery, and the Trust will issue and cause\nthe delivery of the Creation Units. In\ninstances where the Trust accepts Deposit\nSecurities for the purchase of a Creation\nUnit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in\nadvance of receipt by the Trust of all or a\nportion of the applicable Deposit Securities\nas described below. In these circumstances,\nthe initial deposit will have a value greater\nthan the net asset value of the Shares on the\ndate the order is placed in proper form since\nin 37 Table of Contents addition to available\nDeposit Securities, cash must be deposited in\nan amount equal to the sum of (i) the Cash\nComponent, plus (ii) an additional amount of\ncash equal to a percentage of the market value\nas set forth in the Participant Agreement, of\nthe undelivered Deposit Securities (the\n\u201cAdditional Cash Deposit\u201d), which shall be\nmaintained in a general non-interestbearing\ncollateral account. An additional amount of\ncash shall be required to be deposited with\nthe Trust, pending delivery of the missing\nDeposit Securities to the extent necessary to\nmaintain the Additional Cash Deposit with the\nTrust in an amount at least equal to the\napplicable percentage, as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement, of the daily marked to\nmarket value of the missing Deposit\nSecurities. The Trust may use such Additional\nCash Deposit to buy the missing Deposit\nSecurities at any time. Authorized\nParticipants will be liable to the Trust for\nall costs, expenses, dividends, income and\ntaxes associated with missing Deposit\nSecurities, including the costs incurred by\nthe Trust in connection with any such\npurchases. These costs will be deemed to\ninclude the amount by which the actual\npurchase price of the Deposit Securities\nexceeds the market value of such Deposit\nSecurities on the day the purchase order was\ndeemed received by the Principal Underwriter\nplus the brokerage and related transaction\ncosts associated with such purchases. The\nTrust will return any unused portion of the\nAdditional Cash Deposit once all of the\nmissing Deposit Securities have been properly\nreceived by the Custodian or purchased by the\nTrust and deposited into the Trust. In\naddition, a transaction fee as set forth below\nunder \u201cCreation Transaction Fees\u201d will be\ncharged in all cases and an additional\nvariable charge may also be applied. The\ndelivery of Creation Units so created\ngenerally will occur no later than the\nSettlement Date. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF\nCREATION UNITS. The Trust reserves the\nabsolute right to reject an order for Creation\nUnits transmitted in respect of the Fund at\nits discretion, including, without limitation,\nif (a) the order is not in proper form; (b)\nthe Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as\napplicable, delivered by the Authorized\nParticipant are not as disseminated through\nthe facilities of the NSCC for that date by\nthe Custodian; (c) the investor(s), upon\nobtaining the Shares ordered, would own 80% or\nmore of the currently outstanding Shares of\nthe Fund; (d) acceptance of the Deposit\nSecurities would have certain adverse tax\nconsequences to the Fund; (e) the acceptance\nof the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of\ncounsel, be unlawful; (f) the acceptance of\nthe Fund Deposit would otherwise, in the\ndiscretion of the Trust or the Adviser, have\nan adverse effect on the Trust or the rights\nof beneficial owners; (g) the acceptance or\nreceipt of the order for a Creation Unit\nwould, in the opinion of counsel to the Trust,\nbe unlawful; or (h) in the event that\ncircumstances outside the control of the\nTrust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent\nand/or the Adviser make it for all practical\npurposes not feasible to process orders for\nCreation Units. Examples of such circumstances\ninclude acts of God or public service or\nutility problems such as fires, floods,\nextreme weather conditions and power outages\nresulting in telephone, telecopy and computer\nfailures; market conditions or activities\ncausing trading halts; systems failures\ninvolving computer or other information\nsystems affecting the Trust, the Principal\nUnderwriter, the Custodian, the Transfer\nAgent, DTC, NSCC, Federal Reserve System, or\nany other participant in the creation process,\nand other extraordinary events. The Trust or\nits agents shall communicate to the Authorized\nParticipant its rejection of an order. The\nTrust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and\nthe Principal Underwriter are under no duty,\nhowever, to give notification of any defects\nor irregularities in the delivery of Fund\nDeposits nor shall either of them incur any\nliability for the failure to give any such\nnotification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent,\nthe Custodian and the Principal Underwriter\nshall not be liable for the rejection of any\npurchase order for Creation Units. All\nquestions as to the number of shares of each\nsecurity in the Deposit Securities and the\nvalidity, form, eligibility and acceptance for\ndeposit of any securities to be delivered\nshall be determined by the Trust, and the\nTrust\u2019s determination shall be final and\nbinding. REDEMPTION. Shares may be redeemed\nonly in Creation Units at their net asset\nvalue next determined after receipt of a\nredemption request in proper form by the Fund\nthrough the Transfer Agent and only on a\nBusiness Day. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE\nFUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN\nAMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors\nmust accumulate enough Shares in the secondary\nmarket to constitute a Creation Unit in order\nto have such Shares redeemed by the Trust.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that there\nwill be sufficient liquidity in the public\ntrading market at any time to permit assembly\nof a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to\nincur brokerage and other costs in connection\nwith assembling a sufficient number of Shares\nto constitute a redeemable Creation Unit. With\nrespect to the Fund, the Custodian, through\nthe NSCC, makes available prior to the opening\nof business on the NYSE (currently 9:30 a.m.\nEastern time) on each Business Day, the list\nof the names and share quantities of the\nFund\u2019s portfolio securities that will be\napplicable (subject to possible amendment or\ncorrection) to redemption requests received in\nproper form (as defined below) on that day\n(\u201cFund Securities\u201d). Fund Securities received\non redemption may not be identical to Deposit\nSecurities. Redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit are paid either in-kindor in cash, or a\ncombination thereof, as determined by the\nTrust. With respect to in-kindredemptions of\nthe Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation\nUnit will consist of Fund Securities as\nannounced by the Custodian prior to the\nopening of business on the Business Day of the\nrequest for redemption received in proper form\nplus cash in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the net asset value of the Shares\nbeing redeemed, as next determined after a\nreceipt of a request in proper form, and the\nvalue of the Fund Securities (the \u201cCash\nRedemption Amount\u201d), less a fixed redemption\ntransaction fee and any applicable additional\nvariable charge as set forth below. In the\nevent that the Fund Securities have a value\ngreater than the net asset value of the\nShares, a compensating cash payment equal to\nthe differential is required to be made by or\nthrough an Authorized Participant by the\nredeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, at the Trust\u2019s discretion, an\nAuthorized Participant may receive the\ncorresponding cash value of the securities in\nlieu of the in-kindsecurities value\nrepresenting one or more Fund Securities. 38\nTable of Contents PROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF\nCREATION UNITS. After the Trust has deemed an\norder for redemption received, the Trust will\ninitiate procedures to transfer the requisite\nFund Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount\nto the Authorized Participant by the\nSettlement Date. With respect to in-\nkindredemptions of the Fund, the calculation\nof the value of the Fund Securities and the\nCash Redemption Amount to be delivered upon\nredemption will be made by the Custodian\naccording to the procedures set forth under\n\u201cDetermination of Net Asset Value\u201d, computed\non the Business Day on which a redemption\norder is deemed received by the Trust.\nTherefore, if a redemption order in proper\nform is submitted to the Principal Underwriter\nby a DTC Participant by the specified time on\nthe Order Placement Date, and the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund are delivered to\nthe Custodian prior to 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nEastern time (per applicable instructions) on\nthe Settlement Date, then the value of the\nFund Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount\nto be delivered will be determined by the\nCustodian on such Order Placement Date. If the\nrequisite number of Shares of the Fund are not\ndelivered by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern\ntime (per applicable instructions) on the\nSettlement Date, the Fund will not release the\nunderlying securities for delivery unless\ncollateral is posted in such percentage amount\nof missing Shares as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement (marked to market\ndaily). With respect to in-kindredemptions of\nthe Fund, in connection with taking delivery\nof shares of Fund Securities upon redemption\nof Creation Units, an Authorized Participant\nmust maintain appropriate custody arrangements\nwith a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other\ncustody providers in each jurisdiction in\nwhich any of the Fund Securities are\ncustomarily traded (or such other arrangements\nas allowed by the Trust or its agents), to\nwhich account such Fund Securities will be\ndelivered. Deliveries of redemption proceeds\ngenerally will be made within two Business\nDays of the trade date. Due to the schedule of\nholidays in certain countries, however, the\ndelivery of in-kindredemption proceeds may\ntake longer than two Business Days after the\nday on which the redemption request is\nreceived in proper form. The section below\nentitled \u201cLocal Market Holiday Schedules\u201d\nidentifies the instances where more than seven\ndays would be needed to deliver redemption\nproceeds. Pursuant to an order of the SEC, in\nrespect of the Fund, the Trust will make\ndelivery of in-kindredemption proceeds within\nthe number of days stated in the Local Market\nHolidays section to be the maximum number of\ndays necessary to deliver redemption proceeds.\nIf the Authorized Participant has not made\nappropriate arrangements to take delivery of\nthe Fund Securities in the applicable foreign\njurisdiction and it is not possible to make\nother such arrangements, or if it is not\npossible to effect deliveries of the Fund\nSecurities in such jurisdiction, the Trust\nmay, in its discretion, exercise its option to\nredeem such Shares in cash, and the Authorized\nParticipant will be required to receive its\nredemption proceeds in cash. If it is not\npossible to make other such arrangements, or\nif it is not possible to effect deliveries of\nthe Fund Securities, the Trust may in its\ndiscretion exercise its option to redeem such\nShares in cash, and the redeeming investor\nwill be required to receive its redemption\nproceeds in cash. In addition, an investor may\nrequest a redemption in cash that the Fund\nmay, in its sole discretion, permit. In either\ncase, the investor will receive a cash payment\nequal to the NAV of its Shares based on the\nNAV of Shares of the Fund next determined\nafter the redemption request is received in\nproper form (minus a redemption transaction\nfee and additional charge for requested cash\nredemptions specified above, to offset the\nTrust\u2019s brokerage and other transaction costs\nassociated with the disposition of Fund\nSecurities). The Fund may also, in its sole\ndiscretion, upon request of a shareholder,\nprovide such redeemer a portfolio of\nsecurities that differs from the exact\ncomposition of the Fund Securities but does\nnot differ in net asset value. An Authorized\nParticipant submitting a redemption request is\ndeemed to represent to the Trust that, as of\nthe close of the Business Day on which the\nredemption request was submitted, it (or its\nclient) will own (within the meaning of Rule\n200 of Regulation SHO) or has arranged to\nborrow for delivery to the Trust on or prior\nto the Settlement Date of the redemption\nrequest, the requisite number of Shares of the\nFund to be redeemed as a Creation Unit. In\neither case, the Authorized Participant is\ndeemed to acknowledge that: (i) it (or its\nclient) has full legal authority and legal\nright to tender for redemption the requisite\nnumber of Shares of the Fund and to receive\nthe entire proceeds of the redemption; and\n(ii) if such Shares submitted for redemption\nhave been loaned or pledged to another party\nor are the subject of a repurchase agreement,\nsecurities lending agreement or any other\narrangement affecting legal or beneficial\nownership of such Shares being tendered, there\nare no restrictions precluding the tender and\ndelivery of such Shares (including borrowed\nshares, if any) for redemption, free and clear\nof liens, on the redemption Settlement Date.\nThe Trust reserves the right to verify these\nrepresentations at its discretion, but will\ntypically require verification with respect to\na redemption request from the Fund in\nconnection with higher levels of redemption\nactivity and/or short interest in the Fund. If\nthe Authorized Participant, upon receipt of a\nverification request, does not provide\nsufficient verification of its representations\nas determined by the Trust, the redemption\nrequest will not be considered to have been\nreceived in proper form and may be rejected by\nthe Trust. Redemptions of Shares for Fund\nSecurities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable federal and state securities laws\nand the Fund (whether or not it otherwise\npermits cash redemptions) reserves the right\nto redeem Creation Units for cash to the\nextent that the Trust could not lawfully\ndeliver specific Fund Securities upon\nredemptions or could not do so without first\nregistering the Fund Securities under such\nlaws. An Authorized Participant or an investor\nfor which it is acting subject to a legal\nrestriction with respect to a particular\nsecurity included in the Fund Securities\napplicable to the redemption of Creation Units\nmay be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The\nAuthorized Participant may request the\nredeeming investor of the Shares to complete\nan order form or to enter into agreements with\nrespect to such matters as compensating cash\npayment. Further, an Authorized Participant\nthat is not a \u201cqualified institutional buyer,\u201d\n(\u201cQIB\u201d) as such term is defined under Rule\n144A of the Securities Act, will not be able\nto receive Fund Securities that are restricted\nsecurities eligible for resale under Rule\n144A. An Authorized Participant may be\nrequired by the Trust to provide a written\nconfirmation with respect to QIB status in\norder to receive Fund Securities. 39 Table of\nContents The right of redemption may be\nsuspended or the date of payment postponed\nwith respect to the Fund (1) for any period\nduring which the Exchange is closed (other\nthan customary weekend and holiday closings);\n(2) for any period during which trading on the\nExchange is suspended or restricted; (3) for\nany period during which an emergency exists as\na result of which disposal of the Shares of\nthe Fund or determination of the NAV of the\nShares is not reasonably practicable; or (4)\nin such other circumstance as is permitted by\nthe SEC. REQUIRED EARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as described in\nthe Participant Agreement and/or applicable\norder form, the Fund may require orders to be\nplaced prior to the trade date, as described\nin the Participant Agreement or the applicable\norder form, in order to receive the trade\ndate\u2019s net asset value. The cut-offtime to\nreceive the trade date\u2019s net asset value will\nnot precede the calculation of the net asset\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s shares on the prior\nBusiness Day. Orders to purchase shares of\nsuch funds that are submitted on the Business\nDay immediately preceding a holiday or a day\n(other than a weekend) that the equity markets\nin the relevant foreign market are closed may\nnot be accepted. Authorized Participants may\nbe notified that the cut-offtime for an order\nmay be earlier on a particular Business Day,\nas described in the Participant Agreement and\nthe applicable order form. CREATION AND\nREDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES. A transaction\nfee, as set forth in the table below, is\nimposed for the transfer and other transaction\ncosts associated with the purchase or\nredemption of Creation Units, as applicable.\nAuthorized Participants will be required to\npay a fixed creation transaction fee and/or a\nfixed redemption transaction fee, as\napplicable, on a given day regardless of the\nnumber of Creation Units created or redeemed\non that day. The Fund may adjust the\ntransaction fee from time to time. An\nadditional charge or a variable charge\n(discussed below) will be applied to certain\ncreation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standardorders and whole or\npartial cash purchases or redemptions. With\nrespect to creation orders, Authorized\nParticipants are responsible for the costs of\ntransferring the securities constituting the\nDeposit Securities to the account of the Trust\nand with respect to redemption orders,\nAuthorized Participants are responsible for\nthe costs of transferring the Fund Securities\nfrom the Trust to their account or on their\norder. Investors who use the services of a\nbroker or other such intermediary may also be\ncharged a fee for such services.

Fixed-\nincome assets are generally valued as of the\nannounced closing time for trading in fixed-\nincome instruments in a particular market or\nexchange. Creation/redemption order cut-\nofftimes may be earlier on any day that the\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation (or applicable exchange or market\non which the Fund\u2019s investments are traded)\nannounces an early closing time. Any assets or\nliabilities denominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S.\ndollars at market rates on the date of\nvaluation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London\ntime) as quoted by one or more sources. In\ncalculating the Fund\u2019s net asset value per\nShare, the Fund\u2019s investments are generally\nvalued using market valuations. A market\nvaluation generally means a valuation (i)\nobtained from an exchange, a pricing service,\nor a major market maker (or dealer), (ii)\nbased on a price quotation or other equivalent\nindication of value supplied by an exchange, a\npricing service, or a major market maker (or\ndealer) or (iii) based on amortized cost. The\nFund relies on a third-party service provider\nfor assistance with the daily calculation of\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV. The third-party service\nprovider, in turn, relies on other parties for\ncertain pricing data and other inputs used in\nthe 40 Table of Contents calculation of the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Therefore, the Fund is subject to\ncertain operational risks associated with\nreliance on its service provider and that\nservice provider\u2019s sources of pricing and\nother data. NAV calculation may be adversely\naffected by operational risks arising from\nfactors such as errors or failures in systems\nand technology. Such errors or failures may\nresult in inaccurately calculated NAVs, delays\nin the calculation of NAVs and/or the\ninability to calculate NAV over extended time\nperiods. The Fund may be unable to recover any\nlosses associated with such failures. In the\ncase of shares of other funds that are not\ntraded on an exchange, a market valuation\nmeans such fund\u2019s published net asset value\nper share. The Adviser may use various pricing\nservices, or discontinue the use of any\npricing service, as approved by the Board from\ntime to time. A price obtained from a pricing\nservice based on such pricing service\u2019s\nvaluation matrix may be considered a market\nvaluation. In the event that current market\nvaluations are not readily available or are\ndeemed unreliable, the Trust\u2019s procedures\nrequire the Oversight Committee to determine a\nsecurity\u2019s fair value if a market price is not\nreadily available. In determining such value\nthe Oversight Committee may consider, among\nother things, (i) price comparisons among\nmultiple sources, (ii) a review of corporate\nactions and news events, and (iii) a review of\nrelevant financial indicators ( e.g., movement\nin interest rates, market indices, and prices\nfrom the Fund\u2019s Index Provider). In these\ncases, the Fund\u2019s net asset value may reflect\ncertain portfolio securities\u2019 fair values\nrather than their market prices. The fair\nvalue of a portfolio instrument is generally\nthe price which the Fund might reasonably\nexpect to receive upon its current sale in an\norderly market between market participants.\nAscertaining fair value requires a\ndetermination of the amount that an\narm\u2019s-lengthbuyer, under the circumstances,\nwould currently pay for the portfolio\ninstrument. Fair value pricing involves\nsubjective judgments and it is possible that\nthe fair value determination for a security is\nmaterially different than the value that could\nbe realized upon the sale of the security. In\naddition, fair value pricing could result in a\ndifference between the prices used to\ncalculate the Fund\u2019s net asset value and the\nprices used by the Fund\u2019s benchmark Index.\nThis may result in a difference between the\nFund\u2019s performance and the performance of the\nFund\u2019s benchmark Index. With respect to\nsecurities that are primarily listed on\nforeign exchanges, the value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio securities may change on days when\nyou will not be able to purchase or sell your\nShares. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS The\nfollowing information supplements and should\nbe read in conjunction with the section in the\nProspectus entitled \u201cDISTRIBUTIONS.\u201d GENERAL\nPOLICIES Dividends from net investment income,\nif any, are generally declared and paid\nmonthly by the Fund, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period.\nDistributions of net realized securities\ngains, if any, generally are declared and paid\nonce a year, but the Trust may make\ndistributions on a more frequent basis for the\nFund to improve index tracking or to comply\nwith the distribution requirements of the\nInternal Revenue Code, in all events in a\nmanner consistent with the provisions of the\n1940 Act. Dividends and other distributions on\nShares are distributed, as described below, on\na pro rata basis to Beneficial Owners of such\nShares. Dividend payments are made through DTC\nParticipants and Indirect Participants to\nBeneficial Owners then of record with proceeds\nreceived from the Trust. Management of the\nTrust reserves the right to declare special\ndividends if, in its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or advisable to\npreserve the Fund\u2019s eligibility for treatment\nas a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code or to\navoid imposition of income or excise taxes at\nthe Fund level. DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT Broker\ndealers, at their own discretion, may offer a\ndividend reinvestment service under which\nShares are purchased in the secondary market\nat current market prices. Investors should\nconsult their broker dealer for further\ninformation regarding any dividend\nreinvestment service offered by such broker\ndealer. TAXES The following is a summary of\ncertain federal income tax considerations\ngenerally affecting the Fund and its\nshareholders that supplements the discussion\nin the Prospectus. No attempt is made to\npresent a comprehensive explanation of the\nfederal, state, local or foreign tax treatment\nof the Fund or its shareholders, and the\ndiscussion here and in the Prospectus is not\nintended to be a substitute for careful tax\nplanning. The following general discussion of\ncertain federal income tax consequences is\nbased on the Internal Revenue Code and the\nregulations issued thereunder as in effect on\nthe date of this SAI. New legislation, as well\nas administrative changes or court decisions,\nmay significantly change the conclusions\nexpressed herein, and may have a retroactive\neffect with respect to the transactions\ncontemplated herein. 41 Table of Contents The\nfollowing information should be read in\nconjunction with the section in the Prospectus\nentitled \u201cADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION.\u201d\nTAXATION OF THE FUND. The Fund is treated as a\nseparate corporation for federal income tax\npurposes. The Fund therefore is considered to\nbe a separate entity in determining its\ntreatment under the rules for RICs described\nherein and in the Prospectus. Losses in one\nseries of the Trust do not offset gains in any\nother series of the Trust and the requirements\n(other than certain organizational\nrequirements) for qualifying for treatment as\na RIC are determined at the Fund level rather\nthan at the Trust level. The Fund has elected\nor will elect and intends to qualify each year\nto be treated as a separate RIC under\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. As\nsuch, the Fund should not be subject to\nfederal income tax on its net investment\nincome and capital gains, if any, to the\nextent that it timely distributes such income\nand capital gains to its shareholders. In\norder to qualify for treatment as a RIC, the\nFund must distribute annually to its\nshareholders at least the sum of 90% of its\ntaxable net investment income (generally\nincluding the excess of net short-term capital\ngains over net long-term capital losses) and\n90% of its net tax exempt interest income, if\nany (the \u201cDistribution Requirement\u201d) and also\nmust meet several additional requirements.\nAmong these requirements are the following:\n(i) at least 90% of the Fund\u2019s gross income\neach taxable year must be derived from\ndividends, interest, payments with respect to\ncertain securities loans, gains from the sale\nor other disposition of stock, securities or\nforeign currencies, or other income derived\nwith respect to its business of investing in\nsuch stock, securities or currencies, and net\nincome derived from interests in qualified\npublicly traded partnerships (the \u201cQualifying\nIncome Requirement\u201d); and (ii) at the end of\neach quarter of the Fund\u2019s taxable year, its\nassets must be diversified so that (a) at\nleast 50% of the market value of its total\nassets must be represented by cash and cash\nitems, U.S. government securities, securities\nof other RICs and other securities, with such\nother securities limited, in respect to any\none issuer, to an amount not greater in value\nthan 5% of the value of the Fund\u2019s total\nassets and to not more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer,\nand (b) not more than 25% of the value of its\ntotal assets is invested in the securities\n(other than U.S. government securities or\nsecurities of other RICs) of any one issuer,\nthe securities (other than securities of other\nRICs) of two or more issuers that it controls\nand that are engaged in the same, similar, or\nrelated trades or businesses, or the\nsecurities of one or more qualified publicly\ntraded partnerships (the \u201cDiversification\nRequirement\u201d). If the Fund fails to satisfy\nthe Qualifying Income Requirement or the\nDiversification Requirement in any taxable\nyear, the Fund may be eligible for relief\nprovisions if the failures are due to\nreasonable cause and not willful neglect and\nif a penalty tax is paid with respect to each\nfailure to satisfy the applicable\nrequirements. Additionally, relief is provided\nfor certain de minimisfailures of the\nDiversification Requirement where the Fund\ncorrects the failure within a specified period\nof time. In order to be eligible for the\nrelief provisions with respect to a failure to\nmeet the Diversification Requirement, the Fund\nmay be required to dispose of certain assets.\nIf these relief provisions were not available\nto the Fund and it were to fail to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of\nits taxable income would be subject to tax at\nregular corporate rates without any deduction\nfor distributions to shareholders, and its\ndistributions (including capital gains\ndistributions) generally would be taxable as\nordinary income dividends to its shareholders,\nsubject to the dividends-received deduction\nfor corporate shareholders and the lower tax\nrates on qualified dividend income received by\nnoncorporate shareholders. To requalify for\ntreatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable\nyear, the Fund would be required to satisfy\nthe RIC qualification requirements for that\nyear and to distribute any earnings and\nprofits from any year in which the Fund failed\nto qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If the\nFund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period\ngreater than two taxable years, it would\ngenerally be required to pay a Fund-level tax\non certain net built-ingains recognized with\nrespect to certain of its assets upon a\ndisposition of such assets within five years\nof qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year.\nThe Board reserves the right not to maintain\nthe qualification of the Fund for treatment as\na RIC if it determines such course of action\nto be beneficial to shareholders. As discussed\nmore fully below, the Fund intends to\ndistribute substantially all of its net\ninvestment income and its capital gains for\neach taxable year. If the Fund meets the\nDistribution Requirement but retains some or\nall of its income or gains, it will be subject\nto federal income tax to the extent any such\nincome or gains are not distributed. The Fund\nmay designate certain amounts retained as\nundistributed net capital gain in a notice to\nits shareholders, who (i) will be required to\ninclude in income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, as long-term capital gain, their\nproportionate shares of the undistributed\namount so designated, (ii) will be entitled to\ncredit their proportionate shares of the\nincome tax paid by the Fund on that\nundistributed amount against their federal\nincome tax liabilities and to claim refunds to\nthe extent such credits exceed their\nliabilities and (iii) will be entitled to\nincrease their tax basis, for federal income\ntax purposes, in their Shares by an amount\nequal to the excess of the amount of\nundistributed net capital gain included in\ntheir respective income over their respective\nincome tax credits. If the Fund failed to\nsatisfy the Distribution Requirement for any\ntaxable year, it would be taxed as a regular\ncorporation, with consequences generally\nsimilar to those described in the preceding\nparagraph. The Fund will be subject to a 4%\nexcise tax on certain undistributed income if\nit does not distribute to its shareholders in\neach calendar year an amount at least equal to\n98% of its ordinary income for the calendar\nyear plus 98.2% of its capital gain net income\nfor the twelve months ended October 31 of such\nyear, subject to an increase for any shortfall\nin the prior year\u2019s distribution. The Fund\nintends to declare and distribute dividends\nand distributions in the amounts and at the\ntimes necessary to avoid the application of\nthis 4% excise tax. 42 Table of Contents The\nFund may elect to treat part or all of any\n\u201cqualified late year loss\u201d as if it had been\nincurred in the succeeding taxable year in\ndetermining the Fund\u2019s taxable income, net\ncapital gain, net short-term capital gain, and\nearnings and profits. The effect of this\nelection is to treat any such \u201cqualified late\nyear loss\u201d as if it had been incurred in the\nsucceeding taxable year in characterizing Fund\ndistributions for any calendar year. A\n\u201cqualified late year loss\u201d generally includes\nnet capital loss, net long-term capital loss,\nor net short-term capital loss incurred after\nOctober 31 of the current taxable year\n(commonly referred to as \u201cpost-October\nlosses\u201d) and certain other late-year losses.\nCapital losses in excess of capital gains\n(\u201cnet capital losses\u201d) are not permitted to be\ndeducted against a RIC\u2019s net investment\nincome. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, potentially subject to certain\nlimitations, the Fund may carry a net capital\nloss from any taxable year forward\nindefinitely to offset its capital gains, if\nany, in years following the year of the loss.\nTo the extent subsequent capital gains are\noffset by such losses, they will not result in\nU.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund\nand may not be distributed as capital gains to\nits shareholders. Generally, the Fund may not\ncarry forward any losses other than net\ncapital losses. TAXATION OF\nSHAREHOLDERS\u2014DISTRIBUTIONS. The Fund intends\nto distribute annually to its shareholders\nsubstantially all of its investment company\ntaxable income (computed without regard to the\ndeduction for dividends paid), its net tax-\nexemptincome, if any, and any net capital gain\n(net recognized long-term capital gains in\nexcess of net recognized short-term capital\nlosses, taking into account any capital loss\ncarryforwards). The Fund will report to\nshareholders annually the amounts of dividends\npaid from ordinary income and the amount of\ndistributions of net capital gain. Since the\nFund primarily holds investments that do not\npay dividends, it is not expected that a\nsubstantial portion (if any) of the dividends\npaid by the Fund will qualify for either the\ndividends-received deduction for corporations\nor the favorable income tax rates available to\nindividuals on qualified dividend income.\nDistributions from the Fund\u2019s net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be taxable to\nshareholders as ordinary income. Distributions\nfrom the Fund\u2019s net capital gain will be\ntaxable to shareholders at long-term capital\ngains rates, regardless of how long\nshareholders have held their Shares. Long-term\ncapital gains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at rates of up to\n20%. Although dividends generally will be\ntreated as distributed when paid, any dividend\ndeclared by the Fund in October, November or\nDecember and payable to shareholders of record\nin such a month that is paid during the\nfollowing January will be treated for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes as received by\nshareholders on December 31 of the calendar\nyear in which it was declared. If the Fund\u2019s\ndistributions exceed its earnings and profits,\nall or a portion of the distributions made in\nthe taxable year may be treated as a return of\ncapital to shareholders. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not be taxable but\nwill reduce the shareholder\u2019s cost basis and\nresult in a higher capital gain or lower\ncapital loss when the Shares on which the\ndistribution was received are sold. After a\nshareholder\u2019s basis in the Shares has been\nreduced to zero, distributions in excess of\nearnings and profits will be treated as gain\nfrom the sale of the shareholder\u2019s Shares.\nDistributions that are reinvested in\nadditional Shares through the means of a\ndividend reinvestment service, if offered by\nyour broker-dealer, will nevertheless be\ntaxable dividends to the same extent as if\nsuch dividends had been received in cash. A\n3.8% Medicare contribution tax generally\napplies to all or a portion of the net\ninvestment income of a shareholder who is an\nindividual and not a nonresident alien for\nfederal income tax purposes and who has\nadjusted gross income (subject to certain\nadjustments) that exceeds a threshold amount\n($250,000 if married filing jointly or if\nconsidered a \u201csurviving spouse\u201d for federal\nincome tax purposes, $125,000 if married\nfiling separately, and $200,000 in other\ncases). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a\nportion of the undistributed net investment\nincome of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. For these purposes,\ninterest, dividends and certain capital gains\n(generally including capital gain\ndistributions and capital gains realized on\nthe sale of Shares) are generally taken into\naccount in computing a shareholder\u2019s net\ninvestment income. Distributions of ordinary\nincome and capital gains may also be subject\nto foreign, state and local taxes depending on\na shareholder\u2019s circumstances. TAXATION OF\nSHAREHOLDERS \u2013 SALE OF SHARES. In general, a\nsale of Shares results in capital gain or\nloss, and for individual shareholders, is\ntaxable at a federal rate dependent upon the\nlength of time the Shares were held. A sale of\nShares held for a period of one year or less\nat the time of such sale will, for tax\npurposes, generally result in short-term\ncapital gains or losses, and a sale of those\nheld for more than one year will generally\nresult in long-term capital gains or losses.\nLong-term capital gains are generally taxed to\nnoncorporate shareholders at rates of up to\n20%. Gain or loss on the sale of Shares is\nmeasured by the difference between the amount\nreceived and the adjusted tax basis of the\nShares. Shareholders should keep records of\ninvestments made (including Shares acquired\nthrough reinvestment of dividends and\ndistributions) so they can compute the tax\nbasis of their Shares. 43 Table of Contents A\nloss realized on a sale of Shares may be\ndisallowed if substantially identical Shares\nare acquired (whether through the reinvestment\nof dividends or otherwise) within a sixty-\none(61) day period beginning thirty (30) days\nbefore and ending thirty (30) days after the\ndate that the Shares are disposed of. In such\na case, the basis of the Shares acquired must\nbe adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.\nAny loss upon the sale of Shares held for six\n(6) months or less will be treated as a long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of any amounts\ntreated as distributions to the shareholder of\nlong-term capital gain (including any amounts\ncredited to the shareholder as undistributed\ncapital gains). COST BASIS REPORTING. The cost\nbasis of Shares acquired by purchase will\ngenerally be based on the amount paid for the\nShares and then may be subsequently adjusted\nfor other applicable transactions as required\nby the Internal Revenue Code. The difference\nbetween the selling price and the cost basis\nof Shares generally determines the amount of\nthe capital gain or loss realized on the sale\nor exchange of Shares. Contact the broker\nthrough whom you purchased your Shares to\nobtain information with respect to the\navailable cost basis reporting methods and\nelections for your account. TAXATION OF FUND\nINVESTMENTS. Dividends and interest received\nby the Fund on foreign securities may give\nrise to withholding and other taxes imposed by\nforeign countries. Tax conventions between\ncertain countries and the United States may\nreduce or eliminate such taxes. The Fund does\nnot expect to satisfy the requirements for\npassing through to its shareholders any share\nof any foreign taxes paid by the Fund, with\nthe result that shareholders will not include\nsuch taxes in their gross incomes and will not\nbe entitled to a tax deduction or credit for\nsuch taxes on their own returns. Certain Fund\ninvestments may be subject to complex\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code\n(including provisions relating to hedging\ntransactions, straddles, integrated\ntransactions, foreign currency contracts,\nforward foreign currency contracts, and\nnotional principal contracts) that, among\nother things, may affect the character of\ngains and losses realized by the Fund ( i.e.,\nmay affect whether gains or losses are\nordinary or capital), accelerate recognition\nof income to the Fund and defer losses. These\nrules could therefore affect the character,\namount and timing of distributions to\nshareholders. These provisions also may\nrequire the Fund to mark-to-marketcertain\ntypes of positions in its portfolio (i.e.,\ntreat them as if they were closed out) which\nmay cause the Fund to recognize income without\nreceiving cash with which to make\ndistributions in amounts necessary to satisfy\nthe RIC distribution requirements for avoiding\nincome and excise taxes. The Fund intends to\nmonitor its transactions, intends to make\nappropriate tax elections, and intends to make\nappropriate entries in its books and records\nin order to mitigate the effect of these rules\nand preserve the Fund\u2019s qualification for\ntreatment as a RIC. The Fund is required for\nfederal income tax purposes to mark-to-\nmarketand recognize as income for each taxable\nyear its net unrealized gains and losses on\ncertain futures contracts as of the end of the\nyear as well as those actually realized during\nthe year. Gain or loss from futures and\noptions contracts on broad-based indexes\nrequired to be marked to market will be 60%\nlong-term and 40% short-term capital gain or\nloss. Application of this rule may alter the\ntiming and character of distributions to\nshareholders. The Fund may be required to\ndefer the recognition of losses on futures\ncontracts, options contracts and swaps to the\nextent of any unrecognized gains on offsetting\npositions held by the Fund. It is anticipated\nthat certain net gain realized from the\nclosing out of futures or options contracts\nwill be considered gain from the sale of\nsecurities and therefore will be qualifying\nincome for purposes of the Qualifying Income\nRequirement. Investments by the Fund in zero\ncoupon or other discount securities will\nresult in income to the Fund equal to a\nportion of the excess face value of the\nsecurities over their issue price (the\n\u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or \u201cOID\u201d) each year\nthat the securities are held, even though the\nFund may receive no cash interest payments or\nmay receive cash interest payments that are\nless than the income recognized for tax\npurposes. In other circumstances, whether\npursuant to the terms of a security or as a\nresult of other factors outside the control of\nthe Fund, the Fund may recognize income\nwithout receiving a commensurate amount of\ncash. Such income is included in determining\nthe amount of income that the Fund must\ndistribute to maintain its eligibility for\ntreatment as a RIC and to avoid the payment of\nfederal income tax, including the\nnondeductible 4% excise tax described above.\nAny market discount recognized on a market\ndiscount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue, or below adjusted issue price if issued\nwith original issue discount. Absent an\nelection by the Fund to include the market\ndiscount in income as it accrues, gain on the\nFund\u2019s disposition of such an obligation will\nbe treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued\nmarket discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the OID and/or\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by the Fund, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or\ndispose of securities to enable the Fund to\nmake distributions to its shareholders in\norder to qualify for treatment as a RIC and\neliminate taxes at the Fund level. Special\nrules apply if the Fund holds inflation-\nindexed bonds, such as Treasury Inflation-\nProtected Securities (TIPS). Generally, all\nstated interest on inflation-indexed bonds is\ntaken into income by the Fund under its\nregular method of accounting for interest\nincome. The amount of any positive inflation\nadjustment for a taxable year, which results\nfrom an increase in the inflation-adjusted\nprincipal amount of the bond, is treated as\nOID. The amount of the Fund\u2019s OID in a taxable\nyear with respect to a bond will increase the\nFund\u2019s taxable income for such year without a\ncorresponding receipt of cash, until the bond\nmatures. As a result, the Fund may need to use\nother sources of cash to satisfy its\ndistribution requirements for the applicable\nyear. The amount of any negative inflation\nadjustments, 44 Table of Contents which result\nfrom a decrease in the inflation-adjusted\nprincipal amount of the bond, first reduces\nthe amount of interest (including stated\ninterest, OID, and market discount, if any)\notherwise includable in the Fund\u2019s taxable\nincome with respect to the bond for the\ntaxable year; any remaining negative\nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary\nloss or, in certain circumstances, carried\nforward to reduce the amount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the\nbond in future taxable years. TAX-\nEXEMPTSHAREHOLDERS. Certain tax-\nexemptshareholders, including qualified\npension plans, individual retirement accounts,\nsalary deferral arrangements, 401(k) plans,\nand other tax-exemptentities, generally are\nexempt from federal income taxation except\nwith respect to their unrelated business\ntaxable income (\u201cUBTI\u201d). Under current law,\nthe Fund generally serves to block UBTI from\nbeing realized by its tax-exemptshareholders.\nHowever, notwithstanding the foregoing, tax-\nexemptshareholders could realize UBTI by\nvirtue of their investment in the Fund where,\nfor example, (i) the Fund invests in REITs\nthat hold residual interests in real estate\nmortgage investment conduits (\u201cREMICs\u201d) or\n(ii) Shares constitute debt-financed property\nin the hands of the tax-exemptshareholders\nwithin the meaning of section 514(b) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Charitable remainder\ntrusts are subject to special rules and should\nconsult their tax advisors. The IRS has issued\nguidance with respect to these issues and\nprospective shareholders, especially\ncharitable remainder trusts, are strongly\nencouraged to consult with their tax advisors\nregarding these issues. Certain tax-\nexempteducational institutions will be subject\nto a 1.4% tax on net investment income. For\nthese purposes, certain dividends and capital\ngain distributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Shares (among other categories\nof income), are generally taken into account\nin computing a shareholder\u2019s net investment\nincome. FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends, other\nthan capital gains dividends, \u201cshort-term\ncapital gain dividends\u201d and \u201cinterest-related\ndividends\u201d (described below), paid by the Fund\nto shareholders who are nonresident aliens or\nforeign entities will be subject to a 30%\nUnited States withholding tax unless a reduced\nrate of withholding or a withholding exemption\nis provided under applicable treaty law to the\nextent derived from investment income and\nshort-term capital gain or unless such income\nis effectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness carried on through a permanent\nestablishment in the United States.\nNonresident shareholders are urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors concerning the\napplicability of the United States withholding\ntax and the proper withholding form(s) to be\nsubmitted to the Fund. A non-U.S.shareholder\nwho fails to provide an appropriate IRS Form\nW-8may be subject to backup withholding at the\nappropriate rate. Dividends reported by the\nFund as (i) interest-related dividends, to the\nextent such dividends are derived from the\nFund\u2019s \u201cqualified net interest income,\u201d or\n(ii) short-term capital gain dividends, to the\nextent such dividends are derived from the\nFund\u2019s \u201cqualified short-term gain,\u201d are\ngenerally exempt from this 30% withholding\ntax. \u201cQualified net interest income\u201d is the\nFund\u2019s net income derived from U.S.-source\ninterest and original issue discount, subject\nto certain exceptions and limitations.\n\u201cQualified short-term gain\u201d generally means\nthe excess of the Fund\u2019s net short-term\ncapital gain for the taxable year over its net\nlong-term capital loss, if any. In the case of\nShares held through an intermediary, the\nintermediary may withhold even if the Fund\nreports the payment as an interest-related\ndividend or as a short-term capital gain\ndividend. Non-U.S.shareholders should contact\ntheir intermediaries with respect to the\napplication of these rules to their accounts.\nUnless certain non-U.S.entities that hold\nShares comply with IRS requirements that will\ngenerally require them to report information\nregarding U.S. persons investing in, or\nholding accounts with, such entities, a 30%\nwithholding tax may apply to Fund\ndistributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S.shareholder may be exempt from the\nwithholding described in this paragraph under\nan applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the\nterms of such agreement. BACKUP WITHHOLDING.\nThe Fund will be required in certain cases to\nwithhold (as \u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts\npayable to any shareholder who (1) has\nprovided the Fund either an incorrect tax\nidentification number or no number at all, (2)\nis subject to backup withholding by the IRS\nfor failure to properly report payments of\ninterest or dividends, (3) has failed to\ncertify to the Fund that such shareholder is\nnot subject to backup withholding, or (4) has\nnot certified that such shareholder is a U.S.\nperson (including a U.S. resident alien). The\nbackup withholding rate is currently 24%.\nBackup withholding will not be applied to\npayments that have been subject to the 30%\nwithholding tax on shareholders who are\nneither citizens nor permanent residents of\nthe U.S. CREATION UNITS. An Authorized\nParticipant who exchanges securities for\nCreation Units generally will recognize a gain\nor a loss. The gain or loss will be equal to\nthe difference between the market value of the\nCreation Units at the time and the sum of the\nexchanger\u2019s aggregate basis in the securities\nsurrendered plus the amount of cash paid for\nsuch Creation Units. A person who redeems\nCreation Units will generally recognize a gain\nor loss equal to the difference between the\nexchanger\u2019s basis in the Creation Units and\nthe sum of the aggregate market value of any\nsecurities received plus the amount of any\ncash received for such Creation Units. The\nIRS, however, may assert that a loss realized\nupon an exchange of securities for Creation\nUnits cannot be deducted currently under the\nrules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the basis\nthat there has been no significant change in\neconomic position. Any gain or loss realized\nupon a creation of Creation Units will be\ntreated as capital gain or loss if the\nAuthorized Participant holds the securities\nexchanged therefor as capital assets, and\notherwise will be ordinary income or loss.\nSimilarly, any gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption of Creation Units will be treated\nas capital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the Shares comprising the 45\nTable of Contents Creation Units as capital\nassets, and otherwise will be ordinary income\nor loss. Any capital gain or loss realized\nupon the creation of Creation Units will\ngenerally be treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss if the securities exchanged for such\nCreation Units have been held for more than\none year, and otherwise will be short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon the redemption of Creation Units\nwill generally be treated as long-term capital\ngain or loss if the Shares comprising the\nCreation Units have been held for more than\none year, and otherwise, will generally be\nshort-term capital gain or loss. Any capital\nloss realized upon a redemption of Creation\nUnits held for six (6) months or less will be\ntreated as a long-term capital loss to the\nextent of any amounts treated as distributions\nto the applicable Authorized Participant of\nlong-term capital gains with respect to the\nCreation Units (including any amounts credited\nto the Authorized Participant as undistributed\ncapital gains). The Fund has the right to\nreject an order for Creation Units if the\npurchaser (or a group of purchasers) would,\nupon obtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80%\nor more of the outstanding shares of the Fund\nand if, pursuant to section 351 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, the Fund would have a\nbasis in any deposit securities different from\nthe market value of such securities on the\ndate of deposit. The Fund also has the right\nto require information necessary to determine\nbeneficial Share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Fund does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding Shares, the purchaser (or a group\nof purchasers) may not recognize gain or loss\nupon the exchange of securities for Creation\nUnits. Persons purchasing or redeeming\nCreation Units should consult their own tax\nadvisors with respect to the tax treatment of\nany creation or redemption transaction.\nCERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\nUnder promulgated Treasury regulations, if a\nshareholder recognizes a loss on disposition\nof the Fund\u2019s shares of $2 million or more for\nan individual shareholder or $10 million or\nmore for a corporate shareholder (or certain\ngreater amounts over a combination of years),\nthe shareholder must file with the IRS a\ndisclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct\nshareholders of portfolio securities are in\nmany cases excepted from this reporting\nrequirement, but under current guidance,\nshareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A\nshareholder who fails to make the required\ndisclosure to the IRS may be subject to\nadverse tax consequences, including\nsignificant penalties. The fact that a loss is\nreportable under these regulations does not\naffect the legal determination of whether the\ntaxpayer\u2019s treatment of the loss is proper.\nShareholders should consult their tax advisers\nto determine the applicability of these\nregulations in light of their individual\ncircumstances. The foregoing discussion is a\nsummary only and is not intended as a\nsubstitute for careful tax planning.\nPurchasers of Shares should consult their own\ntax advisors as to the tax consequences of\ninvesting in such Shares, including under\nstate, local and other tax laws. Finally, the\nforegoing discussion is based on applicable\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, judicial authority and\nadministrative interpretations in effect on\nthe date hereof. Changes in applicable\nauthority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes\noften occur. CAPITAL STOCK AND SHAREHOLDER\nREPORTS The Fund issues Shares of beneficial\ninterest, par value $.01 per Share. The Board\nmay designate additional funds. Each Share\nissued by the Trust has a pro rata interest in\nthe assets of the corresponding series of the\nTrust. Shares have no preemptive, exchange,\nsubscription or conversion rights and are\nfreely transferable. Each Share is entitled to\nparticipate equally in dividends and\ndistributions declared by the Board with\nrespect to the Fund, and in the net\ndistributable assets of the Fund on\nliquidation. Each Share has one vote with\nrespect to matters upon which a shareholder\nvote is required consistent with the\nrequirements of the 1940 Act and the rules\npromulgated thereunder. Shares of all series\nof the Trust (\u201cFunds\u201d) vote together as a\nsingle class except that if the matter being\nvoted on affects only a particular fund it\nwill be voted on only by that fund and if a\nmatter affects a particular fund differently\nfrom other Funds, that fund will vote\nseparately on such matter. Under Massachusetts\nlaw, the Trust is not required to hold an\nannual meeting of shareholders unless required\nto do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the\nTrust is not to hold an annual meeting of\nshareholders unless required to do so under\nthe 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust\n(regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights for the election of Trustees.\nUnder Massachusetts law, Trustees of the Trust\nmay be removed by vote of the shareholders.\nUnder Massachusetts law, shareholders of a\nbusiness trust may, under certain\ncircumstances, be held personally liable as\npartners for obligations of the Trust.\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an\nexpress disclaimer of shareholder liability\nfor acts or obligations of the Trust, requires\nthat Trust obligations include such\ndisclaimer, and provides for indemnification\nand reimbursement of expenses out of the\nTrust\u2019s property for any shareholder held\npersonally liable for the obligations of the\nTrust. Thus, the risk of a shareholder\nincurring financial loss on account of\nshareholder liability is limited to\ncircumstances in which the Trust itself would\nbe unable to meet its obligations. Given the\nabove limitations on shareholder personal\nliability, and the nature of the Fund\u2019s assets\nand operations, the risk to shareholders of\npersonal liability is believed to be remote.\n46 Table of Contents Shareholder inquiries may\nbe made by writing to the Trust, c/o the\nDistributor, State Street Global Advisors\nFunds Distributors, LLC at One Iron Street,\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210. COUNSEL AND\nINDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 1111 Pennsylvania\nAvenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, serves as\ncounsel to the Trust. Ernst & Young LLP,\nlocated at 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, MA\n02116, serves as the independent registered\npublic accounting firm of the Trust. Ernst &\nYoung LLP performs annual audits of the Fund\u2019s\nfinancial statements and provides other audit,\ntax and related services. LOCAL MARKET HOLIDAY\nSCHEDULES The Trust generally intends to\neffect deliveries of portfolio securities on a\nbasis of \u201cT\u201d plus two Business Days (i.e.,\ndays on which the NYSE is open)in the relevant\nforeign market of the Fund. The ability of the\nTrust to effect in-kindredemptions within two\nBusiness Days of receipt of a redemption\nrequest is subject to, among other things, the\ncondition that, within the time period from\nthe date of the request to the date of\ndelivery of the securities, there are no days\nthat are local market holidays on the relevant\nBusiness Days. For every occurrence of one or\nmore intervening holidays in the local market\nthat are not holidays observed in the United\nStates, the redemption settlement cycle may be\nextended by the number of such intervening\nlocal holidays. In addition to holidays, other\nunforeseeable closings in a foreign market due\nto emergencies may also prevent the Trust from\ndelivering securities within two Business\nDays. The securities delivery cycles currently\npracticable for transferring portfolio\nsecurities to redeeming investors, coupled\nwith local market holiday schedules, may\nrequire a delivery process longer than the\nstandard settlement period. In certain\ncircumstances during the calendar year, the\nsettlement period may be greater than seven\ncalendar days. Such periods are listed in the\ntable below, as are instances where more than\nseven days will be needed to deliver\nredemption proceeds. Since certain holidays\nmay occur on different dates in subsequent\nyears, the number of days required to deliver\nredemption proceeds in any given year may\nexceed the maximum number of days listed in\nthe table below. The proclamation of new\nholidays, the treatment by market participants\nof certain days as \u201cinformal holidays\u201d ( e.g.,\ndays on which no or limited securities\ntransactions occur, as a result of\nsubstantially shortened trading hours), the\nelimination of existing holidays, or changes\nin local securities delivery practices, could\naffect the information set forth herein at\nsome time in the future and longer (worse)\nredemption periods are possible. Listed below\nare the dates in calendar year 2020 (the only\nyear for which holidays are known at the time\nof this SAI filing) in which the regular\nholidays in non-U.S.markets may impact Fund\nsettlement. This list is based on information\navailable to the Fund. The list may not be\naccurate or complete and is subject to change:\n                                              \n  Alb\u2026    Arge\u2026    Austr\u2026    Aust\u2026    Bahra\u2026  \n

We also consider   \n  the size                                    \n  of our total position of the issuer in      \n  question                                    \n  and/or the potential negative governance,   \n  performance profile, and circumstance at    \n  hand. As                                    \n  a result, we believe issuer engagement can  \n  take                                        \n  many forms and be triggered by numerous     \n  circumstances. The following approaches     \n  represent                                   \n  how we define engagement methods:           \n                                              \n  Active We use screening tools designed to   \n  capture                                     \n  a mix of company-specific data including    \n  governance and sustainability profiles to   \n  help us                                     \n  focus our voting and engagement activity.   \n  We will                                     \n  actively seek direct dialogue with the      \n  board and                                   \n  management of companies that we have        \n  identified                                  \n  through our screening processes. Such       \n  engagements                                 \n  may lead to further monitoring to ensure    \n  that the                                    \n  company improves its governance or          \n  sustainability                              \n  practices. In these cases, the engagement   \n  process                                     \n  represents the most meaningful opportunity  \n  for us                                      \n  to protect long-term shareholder value      \n  from                                        \n  excessive risk due to poor governance and   \n  sustainability practices.                   \n                                              \nB-2 Table of Contents\n                                              \n                        Reactive Reactive     \n                        engagement is         \n                        initiated by the      \n                        issuers.

S&P\u2019s Short-Term\nIssue Credit Ratings:\n                                              \n         A short-term obligation rated \u2018A-1\u2019  \n         is rated in the highest category by  \n         S&P Global Ratings. The obligor\u2019s    \n         capacity to meet its financial       \n         commitments on the obligation is     \n  A-1    strong. Within this category,        \n         certain obligations are designated   \n         with a plus sign (+). This           \n         indicates that the obligor\u2019s         \n         capacity to meet its financial       \n         commitments on these obligations is  \n         extremely strong.                    \n         A short-term obligation rated \u2018A-2\u2019  \n         is somewhat more susceptible to the  \n         adverse effects of changes in        \n         circumstances and economic           \n  A-2    conditions than obligations in       \n         higher rating categories. However,   \n         the obligor\u2019s capacity to meet its   \n         financial commitments on the         \n         obligation is satisfactory.          \n         A short-term obligation rated \u2018A-3\u2019  \n         exhibits adequate protection         \n         parameters. However, adverse         \n  A-3    economic conditions or changing      \n         circumstances are more likely to     \n         weaken an obligor\u2019s capacity to      \n         meet its financial commitments on    \n         the obligation.                      \n         A short-term obligation rated \u2018B\u2019    \n         is regarded as vulnerable and has    \n         significant speculative              \n         characteristics. The obligor         \n  B      currently has the capacity to meet   \n         its financial commitments; however,  \n         it faces major ongoing               \n         uncertainties that could lead to     \n         the obligor\u2019s inadequate capacity    \n         to meet its financial commitments.   \n         A short-term obligation rated \u2018C\u2019    \n         is currently vulnerable to           \n         nonpayment and is dependent upon     \n  C      favorable business, financial, and   \n         economic conditions for the obligor  \n         to meet its financial commitments    \n         on the obligation.                   \n         A short-term obligation rated \u2018D\u2019    \n         is in default or in breach of an     \n         imputed promise. For non-hybrid      \n         capital instruments, the \u2018D\u2019 rating  \n         category is used when payments on    \n         an obligation are not made on the    \n         date due, unless S&P Global Ratings  \n         believes that such payments will be  \n         made within any stated grace         \n         period. However, any stated grace    \n  D      period longer than five business     \n         days will be treated as five         \n         business days. The \u2018D\u2019 rating also   \n         will be used upon the filing of a    \n         bankruptcy petition or the taking    \n         of a similar action and where        \n         default on an obligation is a        \n         virtual certainty, for example due   \n         to automatic stay provisions. A      \n         rating on an obligation is lowered   \n         to \u2018D\u2019 if it is subject to a         \n         distressed exchange offer.           \n                                              \nMoody\u2019s Short-Term Obligation Ratings:\nP-1Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated\nPrime-1have a superior ability to repay short-\nterm debt obligations.

In addition, the officers of the Trust\nare substantially identical to the officers of\nSPDR Index Shares Funds, SSGA Master Trust and\nSSGA Active Trust. Additionally, the Trust\u2019s\ninvestment adviser, SSGA FM, also serves as\ninvestment adviser to each series of SPDR\nIndex Shares Funds, SSGA Master Trust and SSGA\nActive Trust. Nonetheless, the Trust takes the\nposition that it is not under common control\nwith other trusts because the power residing\nin the respective boards and officers arises\nas the result of an official position with the\nrespective trusts. Additionally, see the\n\u201cControl Persons and Principal Holders of\nSecurities\u201d section of the Statement of\nAdditional Information for a list of\nshareholders who own more than 5% of a\nspecific fund\u2019s outstanding shares and such\ninformation is incorporated by reference to\nthis Item.\n                             \n  Item\u00a030.  Indemnification  \n                             \nPursuant to Section 5.3 of the Registrant\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust and\nunder Section 4.9 of the Registrant\u2019s By-\nLaws,the Trust will indemnify any person who\nis, or has been, a Trustee, officer, employee\nor agent of the Trust against all expenses\nreasonably incurred or paid by him/her in\nconnection with any claim, action, suit or\nproceeding in which he/she becomes involved as\na party or otherwise by virtue of his/her\nbeing or having been a Trustee, officer,\nemployee or agent and against amounts paid or\nincurred by him/her in the settlement thereof,\nif he/she acted in good faith and in a manner\nhe/she reasonably believed to be in or not\nopposed to the best interests of the Trust,\nand, with respect to any criminal action or\nproceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe\nhis/her conduct was unlawful. In addition,\nindemnification is permitted only if it is\ndetermined that the actions in question did\nnot render him/her liable by reason of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in\nthe performance of his/her duties or by reason\nof reckless disregard of his/her obligations\nand duties to the Registrant. The Registrant\nmay also advance money for litigation expenses\nprovided that Trustees, officers, employees\nand/or agents give their undertakings to repay\nthe Registrant unless their conduct is later\ndetermined to permit indemnification. Pursuant\nto Section 5.2 of the Registrant\u2019s Amended and\nRestated Declaration of Trust, no Trustee,\nofficer, employee or agent of the Registrant\nshall be liable for any action or failure to\nact, except in the case of willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or\nreckless disregard of duties to the\nRegistrant. Pursuant to paragraph 9 of the\nRegistrant\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement,\nthe Adviser shall not be liable for any action\nor failure to act, except in the case of\nwillful misfeasance, bad faith or gross\nnegligence or reckless disregard of duties to\nthe Registrant. Insofar as indemnification for\nliability arising under the Securities Act of\n1933 (the \u201cAct\u201d) may be permitted to\ndirectors, officers and controlling persons of\nthe Registrant pursuant to the provisions of\nRule 484 under the Act, or otherwise, the\nRegistrant has been advised that in the\nopinion of the SEC such indemnification is\nagainst public policy as expressed in the Act\nand is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event\nthat a claim for indemnification against such\nliabilities (other than the payment by the\nRegistrant of expenses incurred or paid by a\ndirector, officer or controlling person of the\nRegistrant in the successful defense of any\naction, suit or proceeding) is asserted by\nsuch director, officer or controlling person\nin connection with the securities being\nregistered, the Registrant will, unless in the\nopinion of its counsel the matter has been\nsettled by controlling precedent, submit to a\ncourt of appropriate jurisdiction the question\nwhether such indemnification by it is against\npublic policy as expressed in the Act and will\nbe governed by the final adjudication of such\nissue. 6 Table of Contents The Registrant\nhereby undertakes that it will apply the\nindemnification provision of its By-Lawsin a\nmanner consistent with Release 11330 of the\nSEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940,\nas amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), so long as the\ninterpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i)\nthereunder remains in effect. The Registrant\nmaintains insurance on behalf of any person\nwho is or was a Trustee, officer, employee or\nagent of the Registrant, or who is or was\nserving at the request of the Registrant as a\ntrustee, director, officer, employee or agent\nof another trust or corporation, against any\nliability asserted against him/her and\nincurred by him/her or arising out of his/her\nposition. However, in no event will the\nRegistrant maintain insurance to indemnify any\nsuch person for any act for which the\nRegistrant itself is not permitted to\nindemnify him/her.\n                                              \n  Item\u00a031.
