  "text": "SSGA Active Trust\n\nSPDR \u00aeIndex Shares Funds\n\nSPDR \u00aeSeries Trust\n\nSupplement dated March 4, 2022 to the\ncurrently effective\n\nStatements of Additional Information (\u0093SAI\u0094),\nas each may be supplemented from time to time\n\nEffective immediately, the following\ndiscussion is added to the \u0093SPECIAL\nCONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS\u0094 section in each SAI:\n\nRUSSIA SANCTIONS RISK\n\nSanctions threatened or imposed by a\nnumber of jurisdictions, including the United\nStates, the European Union and the United\nKingdom, and other intergovernmental actions\nthat have been or may be undertaken in the\nfuture, against Russia, Russian entities or\nRussian individuals, may\nresult in the devaluation of Russian currency,\na downgrade in the country\u0092s credit rating, an\nimmediate freeze of Russian assets, a decline\nin the value and liquidity of Russian\nsecurities, property or interests, and/or\nother adverse\nconsequences to the Russian economy or a Fund.\nThe scope and scale of sanctions in place at a\nparticular time may be expanded or otherwise\nmodified in a way that have negative effects\non a Fund. Sanctions, or the threat of new or\nmodified sanctions,\ncould impair the ability of a Fund to buy,\nsell, hold, receive, deliver or otherwise\ntransact in certain affected securities or\nother investment instruments. Sanctions could\nalso result in Russia taking counter measures\nor other actions in response,\nwhich may further impair the value and\nliquidity of Russian securities. These\nsanctions, and the resulting disruption of the\nRussian economy, may cause volatility in other\nregional and global markets and may negatively\nimpact the performance of\nvarious sectors and industries, as well as\ncompanies in other countries, which could have\na negative effect on the performance of a\nFund, even if a Fund does not have direct\nexposure to securities of Russian issuers. As\na collective result of the\nimposition of sanctions, Russian government\ncountermeasures and the impact that they have\nhad on the trading markets for Russian\nsecurities, certain Funds have used, and may\nin the future use, fair valuation procedures\napproved by the Fund\u0092s\nBoard to value certain Russian securities,\nwhich could result in such securities being\ndeemed to have a zero value.\n\nA reduction in liquidity of certain\nFund holdings as a result of sanctions and\nrelated actions may cause a Fund to experience\nincreased premiums or discounts to its NAV\nand/or wider bid-ask spreads. Additionally, if\nit becomes impracticable or unlawful for a\nFund to hold securities\nsubject to, or otherwise affected by,\nsanctions, or if deemed appropriate by the\nFund\u0092s investment adviser, the Fund may\nprohibit in-kind deposits of the affected\nsecurities in connection with creation\ntransactions and instead require a cash\ndeposit, which may also increase the Fund\u0092s\ntransaction costs.\n\nPLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE\nREFERENCE\n\n030422SUPP2\n"
