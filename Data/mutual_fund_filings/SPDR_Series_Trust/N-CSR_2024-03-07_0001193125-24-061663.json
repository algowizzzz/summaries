A Fund\u2019s per\nshare NAV is\nthe value of one share of a Fund and is calculated by dividing the value of total assets less total\nliabilities by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV return is based on the NAV of a Fund and the market\nreturn is based on the market price per\nshare of a Fund. The market price used to calculate the market return is determined by using the midpoint\nbetween the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of a Fund are listed for\ntrading, as of the time that a\nFund\u2019s NAV is calculated. NAV and market returns assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have\nbeen reinvested in a Fund at NAV. Market returns do not include brokerage commissions that may be payable on\nsecondary market\ntransactions. If brokerage commissions were included market returns would be lower.\n\nAn index is a statistical measure of a specified financial\nmarket or sector. An index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not reflect\ndeductions for fees or expenses. In comparison, a Fund\u2019s performance is negatively impacted by these\ndeductions. Index returns reflect\nall items of income, gain and loss and the reinvestment of dividends and other income.\n\nThe Bloomberg EM Local Currency Government Diversified\nIndex is designed to measure the performance of the fixed-rate local currency sovereign debt of emerging\nmarket countries. The index includes government bonds issued by investment grade and non-investment grade\ncountries outside the United States,\nin local currencies, that have a remaining maturity of one year or more and are rated B3/B-/B- or higher\nusing the middle rating of Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc.\nrespectively.\n\nThe Bloomberg Global Aggregate ex-USD >$1B: Corporate\nBond Index is designed to be a broad based measure of the global investment-grade, fixed rate, fixed income\ncorporate markets outside the United States. The index is part of the Bloomberg Global ex-USD Aggregate Bond\nIndex (the \u201cAggregate\nIndex\u201d). The major components of the Aggregate Index are the Pan-European Aggregate and the Asian Pacific\nAggregate Indices. The securities in the index must have a $1 billion USD equivalent market capitalization\noutstanding and at least 1\nyear remaining. Securities must be fixed rate, although zero coupon bonds and step-ups are permitted.\nAdditionally, securities must be rated investmen grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or better) using the middle rating\nfrom Moody\u2019s Investors Service,\nInc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc. after dropping the highest and lowest available ratings. If\nonly two agencies rate a security, then the more conservative (lower) rating will be used. If only one\nrating agency rates a security,\nthen that one rating will be used. Excluded from the index are subordinated debts, convertible securities,\nfloating-rate notes, fixed-rate perpetuals, warrants, inflation-linked bonds and structured notes. The index\nis market capitalization weighted\nand the securities in the index are updated on the last business day of each month.\n\nThe Bloomberg Global Treasury ex-US Capped Index is\ndesigned to track the fixed-rate local currency sovereign debt of investment grade countries outside the\nUnited States. The index includes government bonds issued by investment grade countries outside the United\nStates, in local currencies, that\nhave a remaining maturity of one year or more and are rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB-or higher using\nthe middle rating of Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc.\nrespectively). The index is\ncalculated by Bloomberg Index Services Limited using a modified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d methodology. This\ndesign ensures that each constituent country within the index is represented in a proportion consistent with\nits percentage with\nrespect to the total market capitalization of the index. The index is rebalanced on a monthly basis.\n\nThe Bloomberg 1-3 Year Global Treasury ex-US Capped Index\nis designed to measure the performance of fixed-rate local currency sovereign debt of investment grade\ncountries outside the United States that have remaining maturities of one to three years. The index includes\ngovernment bonds issued by investment\ngrade countries outside the United States, in local currencies, that have remaining maturities of one to\nthree years and are rated investment grade (Baa3/BBB-/BBB- or higher using the middle rating of Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service, Inc., S&P\nGlobal Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc. respectively). The securities in the index must be fixed-rate and\nhave certain minimum amounts outstanding, depending upon the currency in which the bonds are denominated.\nThe index is calculated by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited using a modified \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d methodology. This design ensures that each\nconstituent country within the index is represented in a proportion consistent with its percentage with\nrespect to the total\nmarket capitalization of the index. Component securities in each constituent country are represented in a\nproportion consistent with their percentage relative to the other component securities in the constituent\ncountry. The securities in the index\nare updated monthly, on the last business day of each month.\n\nThe FTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities Select\nIndex is designed to measure the total return performance of inflation-linked bonds outside the United\nStates with fixed-rate coupon payments that are linked to an inflation index. Inflation-protected public\nobligations of the inflation-linked\ngovernment bond markets of developed and emerging market countries, commonly known in the United States as\nTIPS, are securities issued by such governments that are designed to provide inflation protection to\ninvestors. The index includes government\ndebt (direct obligations of the issuer country) but does not include quasi-government debt or corporate\ndebt.\nSee accompanying notes to financial statements.                                                             \n                                                     1                                                      \nTable of Contents                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                 SPDR                                                                       \n                                 BLOOMBERG EMERGING MARKETS LOCAL BOND ETF                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                 MANAGEMENT\u2019S                                                               \n                                 DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE (UNAUDITED)                                 \n                                                                                                            \nThe SPDR\nBloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that, before fees\nand expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of an index that tracks the fixed-rate\nlocal currency\nsovereign debt of emerging market countries. The Fund\u2019s benchmark is the Bloomberg EM Local Currency\nGovernment Diversified Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31, 2023 (the\n\u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total return for the Fund was 9.79%, and the Index was 10.14%. The Fund and Index\nreturns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income. The Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the\nFund, including brokerage and advisory expenses. The Index is unmanaged and Index returns do not reflect\nfees and expenses of any kind, which would have a negative impact on returns. Fees, expenses, cash drag, tax\nwithholdings, and sampling\ncontributed to the difference between the Fund\u2019s performance and that of the index.\nGlobal concerns around heightened inflation, changes in                                                     \ncentral bank policies, and March\u2019s banking crisis were primary drivers of Fund performance during the       \nReporting Period. The Fund performed in line with expectations.                                             \nGlobal markets experienced heightened volatility in March\nafter a number of U.S. regional banks as well as Credit Suisse were downgraded by ratings agencies and\nultimately either failed or were bought by other large banks. The incident sent shockwaves through global\nmarkets as investors feared contagion\ninto other sectors of the global economy. Ultimately, the contagion story did not play out, and market\nvolatility was calmed as early as April.\n\nIn order to reign in persistent inflation and overheated\neconomies across the globe, countries\u2019 central banks began an about-face on previous easy monetary policy in\n2022, with many embarking on aggressive rate hiking cycles. The European Central bank and Bank of England\nraised interest rates by a\ntotal of 4.50% and 5.00% respectively over the past two years. The hawkish pivot of global central banks\nroiled sovereign markets and sent yields soaring, leading to negative returns within the sector during the\nfirst half of 2023. By the second\nhalf of the year, and especially in the fourth quarter, global tightening seemed to finally take effect on\ncooling inflation, and major central banks paused their rate hiking.

The Fund\u2019s benchmark is the Bloomberg Global\nAggregate ex-USD >$1B: Corporate Bond Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31, 2023 (the\n\u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total return for the Fund was 11.13%, and the Index was 11.75%. The Fund and Index\nreturns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income. The Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing\nthe Fund, including brokerage and advisory expenses. The Index is unmanaged and Index returns do not reflect\nfees and expenses of any kind, which would have a negative impact on returns. Fees and expenses, cash drag,\nthe cumulative effect of\nsecurity misweights, and tax withholdings contributed to the difference between the Fund\u2019s performance and\nthat of the Index.\nGlobal concerns around heightened inflation, changes in                                                     \ncentral bank policies, and the March banking crisis were primary drivers of Fund performance during the     \nReporting Period. The Fund performed in line with expectations.                                             \nGlobal markets experienced heightened volatility in March\nafter a number of U.S. regional banks as well as Credit Suisse were downgraded by ratings agencies and\nultimately either failed or were bought by other large banks. The incident sent shockwaves through global\nmarkets as investors feared contagion\ninto other sectors of the global economy and corporate bond performance suffered as investors fled to safe-\nhaven assets. Ultimately, the contagion story did not play out, and market volatility was calmed as early as\nApril.\n\nIn order to reign in persistent inflation and overheated\neconomies across the globe, countries\u2019 central banks began an about-face on previous easy monetary policy in\n2022, with many embarking on aggressive rate hiking cycles. The European Central bank and Bank of England\nraised interest rates by a\ntotal of 4.50% and 5.00% respectively over the past two years. The hawkish pivot of global central banks\nroiled sovereign markets and sent yields soaring, leading to negative returns within the sector during the\nfirst half of 2023. By the second\nhalf of the year, and especially in the fourth quarter, global tightening seemed to finally take effect on\ncooling inflation, and major central banks paused their rate hiking.

The European Central bank and Bank of England\nraised interest rates by a\ntotal of 4.50% and 5.00% respectively over the past two years. The hawkish pivot of global central banks\nroiled sovereign markets and sent yields soaring, leading to negative returns within the sector during the\nfirst half of 2023. By the second\nhalf of the year, and especially in the fourth quarter, global tightening seemed to finally take effect on\ncooling inflation, and major central banks paused their rate hiking. With the end of heightened inflation in\nsight for many economies, markets\nare now pricing in hikes for 2024.

The Fund\u2019s benchmark is the FTSE International Inflation-Linked Securities Select Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d).\n\nFor the 12-month period ended December 31, 2023 (the\n\u201cReporting Period\u201d), the total return for the Fund was 8.74%, and the Index was 9.51%. The Fund and Index\nreturns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income. The Fund\u2019s performance reflects the expenses\nof managing the\nFund, including brokerage and advisory expenses. The Index is unmanaged and Index returns do not reflect\nfees and expenses of any kind, which would have a negative impact on returns. Fees, expenses, cash drag, tax\nwithholdings, and sampling\ncontributed to the difference between the Fund\u2019s performance and that of the index.\nGlobal concerns around heightened inflation, changes in                                                     \ncentral bank policies, and the March banking crisis were primary drivers of Fund performance during the     \nReporting Period. The Fund performed in line with expectations.                                             \nGlobal markets experienced heightened volatility in March\nafter a number of U.S. regional banks as well as Credit Suisse were downgraded by ratings agencies and\nultimately either failed or were bought by other large banks. The incident sent shockwaves through global\nmarkets as investors feared contagion\ninto other sectors of the global economy. Ultimately, the contagion story did not play out, and market\nvolatility was calmed as early as April.\n\nIn order to reign in persistent inflation and overheated\neconomies across the globe, countries\u2019 central banks began an about-face on previous easy monetary policy in\n2022, with many embarking on aggressive rate hiking cycles. The European Central bank and Bank of England\nraised interest rates by a\ntotal of 4.50% and 5.00% respectively over the past two years. The hawkish pivot of global central banks\nroiled sovereign markets and sent yields soaring, leading to negative returns within the sector during the\nfirst half of 2023. By the second\nhalf of the year, and especially in the fourth quarter, global tightening seemed to finally take effect on\ncooling inflation, and major central banks paused their rate hiking.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The\nfollowing is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust in the preparation of its\nfinancial statements: The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. Each Fund is an investment company under U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting\nguidance applicable to investment companies. Security Valuation Each Fund's investments are valued at fair\nvalue each day that the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) is open and, for financial reporting purposes, as\nof the report date should the reporting period end on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair value is\ngenerally defined as the price a fund would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. By its nature, a fair value price\nis a good faith estimate of the valuation in a current sale and may not reflect an actual market price. The\ninvestments of each Fund are valued pursuant to the policy and procedures developed by the Oversight\nCommittee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) and approved by the Board. The Committee provides oversight of the valuation of\ninvestments for the Funds. The Board has responsibility for overseeing the determination of the fair value\nof investments. Valuation techniques used to value each Fund\u2019s investments by major category are as follows:\n\u2022 Investments in registered investment companies (including money market funds) or other unitized pooled\ninvestment vehicles that are not traded on an exchange are valued at that day\u2019s published net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d) per share or unit. \u2022 Government and municipal fixed income securities are generally valued using\nquotations from independent pricing services or brokers. Certain government inflation-indexed securities may\nrequire a calculated fair valuation as the cumulative inflation is contained within the price provided by\nthe pricing service or broker.

Derivative Financial Instruments Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts Certain Funds may\nengage in forward foreign currency contracts to acquire exposure to foreign currencies or to hedge the\nFund\u2019s investments against currency fluctuations. A forward foreign currency exchange contract is a\ncommitment to purchase or sell a foreign currency at the settlement date at a negotiated rate. Non-\ndeliverable forward foreign currency exchange contracts are settled with the counterparty in cash without\nthe delivery of foreign currency. The contract is marked-to-market daily and the change in market value is\nrecorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or loss. When the contract is closed, a Fund recognizes a\nrealized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened\nand the value at the time it was closed. Certain risks may arise upon entering into forward foreign currency\nexchange contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and\nare generally limited to the amount of unrealized gains on appreciated contracts, if any. Additionally, when\nutilizing forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge, the Funds give up the opportunity to profit\nfrom favorable exchange rate movements during the term of the contract. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF entered into forward foreign currency exchange\ncontracts to manage currency exposure.

Except when aggregated\nin Creation Units, shares of each Fund are not redeemable. Transactions in capital shares for each Fund are\ndisclosed in detail in the Statements of Changes in Net Assets. The consideration for the purchase of\nCreation Units of a Fund may consist of the in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio of securities and a\nspecified amount of cash. Investors purchasing and redeeming Creation Units may pay a purchase transaction\nfee and a redemption transaction fee directly to the Trust and/or custodian, to offset transfer and other\ntransaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units, including Creation Units\nfor cash. An additional variable fee may be charged for certain transactions. Such variable charges, if any,\nare included in \u201cOther Capital\u201d on the Statements of Changes in Net Assets.\n\n97\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) December 31, 2023\n\n8. Income Tax Information The Funds have qualified and intend to continue to qualify as regulated investment\ncompanies under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. Each Fund will not be subject to federal income\ntaxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net realized capital gains, for each\nfiscal year. Therefore, no provision for federal income tax is required. The Funds file federal and various\nstate and local tax returns as required. No income tax returns are currently under examination. Generally,\nthe federal returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years\nfrom date of filing, while the state returns may remain open for an additional year depending upon\njurisdiction. SSGA FM has analyzed each Fund's tax positions taken on tax returns for all open years and\ndoes not believe there are any uncertain tax positions that would require recognition of a tax liability.\nCertain capital accounts in the financial statements have been adjusted for permanent book-tax differences.\nThese adjustments have no impact on NAV or results of operations. Temporary book-tax differences will\nreverse in the future. These book-tax differences are primarily due to differing treatments for character of\ndistributions, in-kind transactions, foreign currencies, premium amortization, net operating losses, wash\nsale loss deferrals, TIPS adjustments, forward contracts and distributions in excess of current earnings.\nDistributions to shareholders are recorded on ex-dividend date. Income dividends and gain distributions are\ndetermined in accordance with income tax rules and regulations, which may differ from generally accepted\naccounting principles.

          \n9. Securities Lending Each Fund may lend securities to qualified broker-dealers or institutional investors.\nThe loans are secured at all times by cash, cash equivalents or U.S. government securities in an amount at\nleast equal to the market value of the securities loaned, plus accrued interest and dividends, determined on\na daily basis and adjusted accordingly. The value of the collateral with respect to a loaned security may be\ntemporarily more or less than the value of a security due to market fluctuations of securities values. With\nrespect to each loan, if on any U.S. business day the aggregate market value of securities collateral plus\ncash collateral is less than the aggregate market value of the securities which are subject to the loan, the\nborrower will be notified to provide additional collateral on the next business day. The Funds will regain\nrecord ownership of loaned securities to exercise certain beneficial rights; however, the Funds may bear the\nrisk of delay in recovery of, or even loss of rights in the securities loaned should the borrower fail\nfinancially. In addition, a Fund will bear the risk of loss of any cash collateral that it may invest. Each\nFund receives compensation for lending its securities from interest or dividends earned on the cash, cash\nequivalents or U.S. government securities held as collateral, net of fee rebates paid to the borrower and\nnet of fees paid to State Street as the lending agent. Additionally, a Fund will receive a fee from the\nborrower for non-cash collateral equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. The\nmarket value of securities on loan as of December 31, 2023, and the value of the invested cash collateral\nare disclosed in the Funds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Non-cash collateral is not disclosed in\nthe Funds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities as it is held by the lending agent on behalf of the Funds\nand the Funds do not have the ability to re-hypothecate those securities. Securities lending income, as\ndisclosed in the Funds' Statements of Operations, represents the income earned from the non-cash collateral\nand the investment of cash collateral, net of fee rebates paid to the borrower and net of fees paid to State\nStreet as lending agent. The following is a summary of each Fund's securities lending agreements and related\ncash and non-cash collateral received as of December 31, 2023:\n

Line of Credit The Funds and other affiliated funds (each, a \u201cParticipant\u201d and collectively, the\n\u201cParticipants\u201d) have access to $180 million of a $960 million ($200 million of $1.275 billion prior to\nOctober 5, 2023) revolving credit facility, provided by a syndication of banks under which the Participants\nmay borrow to fund shareholder redemptions. This agreement expires in October 2024 unless extended or\nrenewed. The Participants are charged an annual commitment fee which is calculated based on the unused\nportion of the shared credit line. Commitment fees are allocated among each of the Participants based on\nrelative net assets. Commitment fees are ordinary fund operating expenses paid by the Adviser. A Participant\nincurs and pays the interest expense related to its borrowing. Interest is calculated at a rate per annum\nequal to the sum of 1.00% plus the greater of the New York Fed Bank Rate. The Fund had no outstanding loans\nas of December 31, 2023. 11. Risks Concentration Risk As a result of the Funds\u2019 ability to invest a large\npercentage of their assets in obligations of issuers within the same country, state, region, currency or\neconomic sector, an adverse economic, business or political development may affect the value of the Funds\u2019\ninvestments more than if the Funds were more broadly diversified. Foreign and Emerging Markets Risk\nInvesting in foreign markets involves risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in\nthe U.S. Foreign securities may be subject to risk of loss because of government regulation, economic,\npolitical and social instability in the countries in which the Funds' invest. Foreign markets may be less\nliquid than investments in the U.S. and may be subject to the risks of currency fluctuations. To the extent\nthat a Fund invests in securities of issuers located in emerging markets, these risks may be even more\npronounced. Credit Risk A Fund may be exposed to credit risk in the event that an issuer or guarantor fails\nto perform or that an institution or entity with which the Fund has unsettled or open transactions defaults.\nMarket Risk Each Fund\u2019s investments are subject to changes in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change substantially due to various factors including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness\nof issuers, and general market liquidity. The Funds are subject to the risk that geopolitical events will\ndisrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies and markets. Local, regional, or global\nevents such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness, such as COVID-19, or other public\nhealth issues, or other events could have a significant impact on a Fund and its investments.\n\n100\nTable of Contents                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n  SPDR SERIES                                                                                               \n  TRUST                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(continued)                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  December 31, 2023                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  Russian\u00a0Sanctions\u00a0Risk                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nSanctions threatened or imposed by a number of jurisdictions,                                               \nincluding the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, and other intergovernmental actions \nthat have been or may be undertaken in the future, against Russia, Russian entities or Russian individuals, \nmay result in the devaluation of                                                                            \nRussian currency, a downgrade in the country\u2019s credit rating, an immediate freeze of Russian assets, a      \ndecline in the value and liquidity of Russian securities, property or interests, and/or other adverse       \nconsequences to the Russian economy or                                                                      \na Fund. The scope and scale of sanctions in place at a particular time may be expanded or otherwise modified\nin a way that have negative effects on a Fund.

This example is intended to help you\nunderstand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the\nongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds. It is based on an investment of $1,000 made at the\nbeginning of the period shown and held for the entire period from July 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. The\ntable below illustrates your Fund\u2019s cost in two ways: Based on actual fund return \u2014\u2014This section helps you\nto estimate the actual expenses that you paid over the period. The \u201cEnding Account Value\u201d shown is derived\nfrom each Fund's actual return, and the third column shows the dollar amount that would have been paid by an\ninvestor who started with $1,000 in each Fund. You may use the information here, together with the amount\nyou invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. To do so, simply divide your account\nvalue by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by\nthe number given for the Fund under the heading \u201cExpenses Paid During Period\u201d. Based on hypothetical 5%\nreturn \u2014\u2014This section is intended to help you compare your Fund\u2019s costs with those of other mutual funds. It\nassumes that the Fund had a yearly return of 5% before expenses, but that the expense ratio is unchanged. In\nthis case, because the return used is not the Fund\u2019s actual return, the results do not apply to your\ninvestment. The example is useful in making comparisons because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(the \u201cSEC\u201d) requires all mutual funds to calculate expenses based on a 5% return. You can assess your Fund\u2019s\ncosts by comparing this hypothetical example with the hypothetical examples that appear in shareholder\nreports of other funds. Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing\ncosts only and do not reflect any transaction costs, such as sales load charges (loads). Therefore, the\nhypothetical 5% return section of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you\ndetermine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if these transaction costs were\nincluded, your costs would have been higher.\n

State Street Global\nAdvisors\nOne Iron Street\nBoston, MA 02210 ETFs trade like stocks, are subject\nto investment risk, fluctuate in market value and may\ntrade at prices above or below the ETFs net asset\nvalue. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will\nreduce returns. Bonds generally present less short-\nterm risk and volatility than stocks, but contain\ninterest rate risk (as interest rates rise bond\nprices usually fall); issuer default risk; issuer\ncredit risk; liquidity risk; and inflation risk.\nThese effects are usually pronounced for longer-term\nsecurities.
