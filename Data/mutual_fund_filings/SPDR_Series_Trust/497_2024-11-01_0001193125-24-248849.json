You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.25%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.25%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $26        $80    $141     $318  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 4 % of the average value\nof its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\nIn seeking to track the performance of the Dow Jones U.S.\nSelect REIT Capped Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index,\n\n1\n\nthe Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\nThe Index is designed to provide a measure of real estate\nsecurities that serve as proxies for direct real estate\ninvesting, in part by excluding securities whose value is\nnot always closely tied to the value of the underlying real\nestate. The reason for the exclusions is that performance\nof such securities may be driven by factors other than the\nvalue of real estate. The Index is a market capitalization\nweighted index of publicly traded real estate investment\ntrusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) and is comprised of companies whose\ncharters are the equity ownership and operation of\ncommercial and/or residential real estate and which operate\nunder the REIT Act of 1960. To be included in the Index, a\ncompany must be both an equity owner and operator of\ncommercial and/or residential real estate. Businesses\nexcluded from the Index include: those classified under the\nDow Jones REIT/RESI Industry Classification Hierarchy\nand/or Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) as\n\u201cSpecialty\u201d ( i.e. , REIT types that cannot be easily\nclassified within the Hierarchy, including timber REITs,\nrailroad REITs and tower REITs), hybrid REITS, mortgage\nREITs, real estate finance companies, mortgage brokers and\nbankers, commercial and residential real estate brokers and\nestate agents, home builders, large landowners and\nsubdividers of unimproved land, as well as companies that\nhave more than 25% of their assets in direct mortgage\ninvestments. A company must have a minimum float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization of at least $200 million at the time\nof its inclusion, and at least 75% of the company's total\nrevenue must be derived from the ownership and operation of\nreal estate assets. A stock must have a median daily value\ntraded of at least $5 million for the three-months prior to\nthe rebalancing reference date. The Index is generally\nrebalanced quarterly, and returns are calculated on a buy\nand hold basis except as necessary to reflect the\noccasional occurrence of Index changes in the middle of the\nmonth. Each REIT in the Index is weighted by its float-\nadjusted market capitalization (i.e., each security is\nweighted to reflect the attainable market capitalization of\nthe security which reflects that portion of securities\nshares that are accessible to investors), subject to the\nfollowing constraints applied at each rebalancing: (i) no\nsingle company's weight can exceed 10%, and (ii) the\naggregate weight of all companies weighing above 4.5%\ncannot exceed 22.5%. In addition, each company's weight in\nthe Index is reviewed daily and when the sum of companies\nwith a weight greater than 5% exceeds 25%, additional\ncapping is performed, effective after the close of business\non the next trading day. The Index is priced daily and is a\ntotal return (price and income) benchmark. As of July 31,\n2024, the Index comprised 102 REITs. The Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which\nis not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index\nProvider determines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time. Real\nEstate Sector Risk: An investment in a real property\ncompany may be subject to risks similar to those associated\nwith direct ownership of real estate, including, by way of\nexample, the possibility of declines in the value of real\nestate, losses from casualty or condemnation, and changes\nin local and general economic conditions, supply and\ndemand, interest rates, environmental liability, zoning\nlaws, regulatory limitations on rents, property taxes, and\noperating expenses. Some real property companies have\nlimited diversification because they invest in a limited\nnumber of properties, a narrow geographic area, or a single\ntype of property.\n\n2\n\nREIT Risk: Real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) are\nsubject to the risks associated with investing in the\nsecurities of real property companies. In particular, REITs\nmay be affected by changes in the values of the underlying\nproperties that they own or operate. Further, REITs are\ndependent upon specialized management skills, and their\ninvestments may be concentrated in relatively few\nproperties, or in a small geographic area or a single\nproperty type. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow\ndependency and, as a result, are particularly reliant on\nthe proper functioning of capital markets. A variety of\neconomic and other factors may adversely affect a lessee's\nability to meet its obligations to a REIT. In the event of\na default by a lessee, the REIT may experience delays in\nenforcing its rights as a lessor and may incur substantial\ncosts associated in protecting its investments. In\naddition, a REIT could fail to qualify for favorable\nregulatory treatment. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nin the secondary market may differ from the Fund's daily\nnet asset value per share and there may be times when the\nmarket price of the shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset value per\nshare (discount). This risk is heightened in times of\nmarket volatility or periods of steep market declines.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective September 20, 2024 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Index (the \u201cPrevious\nBenchmark Index\u201d) to the Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Capped Index, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the performance of the current index. Performance of the Fund prior\nto the Benchmark Index Change Date is therefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index and may have been different had the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                                                                 \n                                                   OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                              13.84%   5.85%      6.74%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions              12.15%   4.46%      5.23%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of  8.26%    4.01%      4.68%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                    \n  Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Index (reflects no    13.96%   6.12%      7.00%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                         \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,   26.29%   15.69%     12.03%    \n  expenses or taxes)                                                             \n                                                                                 \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Lisa Hobart. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Lisa Hobart is a Vice President\nof the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in\n2006. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as\n\u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a\ndesignated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\n\n4\n\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund\nShares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to\naccept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Certain capital gain dividends attributable to dividends the Fund receives from U.S.\nREITs may be taxable to noncorporate shareholders at a rate other than the generally applicable reduced\nrates. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Some distributions\nmay be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n5\n\nSPDR \u00ae FactSet Innovative Technology ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF (the    \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the total return performance of the FactSet        \n  InnovativeTechnology Index.                        \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.45%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 34 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the FactSet\nInnovative Technology Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs\na sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex (including common stock, preferred stock, depositary\nreceipts and shares of other investment companies). The\nFund may also invest in cash and cash equivalents or money\nmarket instruments (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in\nan industry or group of industries, but only to the extent\nthat the Index concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. Futures contracts (a type of\nderivative instrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to its Index.\n\n6\n\nThe Index is designed to represent the performance of\nU.S.-listed stock and American Depository Receipts (\u201cADRs\u201d)\nof Technology companies and Technology-related companies\n(including Electronic Media companies) within the most\ninnovative segments of the Technology sector and Electronic\nMedia sub-sector of the Media sector, as defined by FactSet\nResearch Systems, Inc. (\u201cFactSet\u201d or the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d).\nThe Index Provider considers the most innovative segments\nof the Technology sector and Electronic Media sub-sector to\nbe those with the highest revenue growth and believes that\nthese companies are often involved in cutting edge\nresearch, innovative product and service development,\ndisruptive business models, or a combination of these\nactivities. In addition to traditional Technology\ncompanies, Electronic Media companies are included in the\nIndex because of their core focus on technology and the\nintegral role technology plays in determining how such\ncompanies operate, innovate and compete within their\nindustry. FactSet defines the Technology sector to include\nInformation Technology Services providers, Hardware\nmanufacturers, Software manufacturers, Electronic\nComponents manufacturers, and Manufacturing Equipment and\nServices providers. FactSet defines the Electronic Media\nsub-sector to include companies that produce media content\nin digital format and deliver, distribute and monetize\ntheir content via an electronic medium such as the\nInternet. FactSet sector determinations are based on a\ncomprehensive, structured taxonomy designed to seek to\noffer precise industry classification of global companies\naccording to the products and services sold by such\ncompanies (the \u201cFactSet Revere Hierarchy\u201d). The FactSet\nRevere Hierarchy reflects a variable depth structure that,\nwith respect to the Index, consists of twelve levels of\nincreasingly specialized Technology or Electronic Media\nsub-sectors. Technology and electronic media companies are\nclassified or mapped to the sub-sectors from which they\neach derive 50% or more of their respective revenues. A\ncompany will be eligible for inclusion in the Index if it\nsatisfies the following criteria: (i) is mapped to a\nTechnology or Electronic Media sub-sector at the fourth\nlevel or lower (levels four through twelve) in the FactSet\nRevere Hierarchy; (ii) is mapped to a sub-sector in the top\nquartile of FactSet's composite revenue growth scoring\nsystem for the Technology sector or Electronic Media sub-\nsector (the \u201crevenue growth scoring system\u201d); (iii) has a\nmarket capitalization of shares publicly available to\ninvestors (i.e., a \u201cfloat-adjusted\u201d market capitalization)\nabove $500 million with a float-adjusted liquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar value traded over the previous 12 months\ndivided by the float-adjusted market capitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing reference date) above 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization above $400 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as defined above)\nabove 150%; (iv) is a U.S.-listed stock or ADR; and (v) has\nnot had an initial public offering of shares within three\nmonths of the Review Selection Day (defined below). The\nIndex is equal-weighted to ensure that each of its\ncomponent securities is represented in approximate equal\ndollar value at each reconstitution. The Index is capped at\na maximum of 100 constituent securities. If there are fewer\nthan 50 stocks suitable for inclusion based on the\neligibility criteria, stocks mapped to the next highest-\nranked quartile of sub-sectors would be added until the\nminimum number of Index constituents is met. To ensure that\neach component stock continues to represent approximate\nequal market value in the Index, adjustments, if necessary,\nare made annually after the close of trading on the third\nFriday of December (the \u201cReconstitution Day\u201d) based on\ninformation as of the last business day two weeks before\nthe Reconstitution Day (the \u201cReview Selection Day\u201d). As of\nJuly 31, 2024, the Index was comprised of 100 stocks. The\nIndex is sponsored by FactSet (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which\nis not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index\nProvider determines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments.\n\n7\n\nEquity Investing Risk: The market prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes\nrapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security may\ndecline for a number of reasons that may directly relate to\nthe issuer and also may decline due to general industry or\nmarket conditions that are not specifically related to a\nparticular company. In addition, equity markets tend to\nmove in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over\nshort or extended periods of time. Technology Sector Risk:\nMarket or economic factors impacting technology companies\nand companies that rely heavily on technological advances\ncould have a major effect on the value of the Fund's\ninvestments. The value of stocks of technology companies\nand companies that rely heavily on technology is\nparticularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid product obsolescence, government\nregulation and competition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Technology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nElectronic Media Companies Risk: Electronic media companies\ncreate, own, and distribute various forms of technology-\nbased visual, audio, and interactive content, as well as\ninformation databases that they sell or lease to others.\nElectronic media companies can be adversely affected by,\namong other things, changes in government regulation,\nintense competition, dependency on patent protection, and\nrapid obsolescence of products and services due to product\ncompatibility or changing consumer preferences. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought\nand sold in the secondary market at market prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of the shares is\nmore than the net asset value per share (premium) or less\nthan the net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments in a particular industry or sector,\nfinancial, economic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic\nsector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it\nhad not done so. Depositary Receipts Risk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying securities in their primary trading\nmarket. If a depositary receipt is denominated in a\ndifferent currency than its underlying securities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the currency risk of both the investment\nin the depositary receipt and the underlying security.\nHolders of depositary receipts may have limited or no\nrights to take action with respect to the underlying\nsecurities or to compel the issuer of the receipts to take\naction. The prices of depositary receipts may differ from\nthe prices of securities upon which they are based. To the\nextent the Fund invests in depositary receipts based on\nsecurities included in the Index, such differences in\nprices may increase index tracking risk. Investments in\ndepositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks\nas their underlying securities, including political,\nregulatory, and economic risks. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a non-U.S. entity that\nissues the underlying securities than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; liquidity risks;\ndiffering securities market structures; higher transaction\ncosts; and various administrative difficulties. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations.\n\n8\n\nGrowth Stock Risk: The prices of growth stocks may be based\nlargely on expectations of future earnings, and their\nprices can decline rapidly and significantly in reaction to\nnegative news. Growth stocks may underperform value stocks\nand stocks in other broad style categories (and the stock\nmarket as a whole) over any period of time and may shift in\nand out of favor with investors generally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on changes in market, economic, and\nother factors. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with an indexing investment strategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index\nof securities, regardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual securities\ncomprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed\nfund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active\ninvestment strategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Index and, consequently, the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to time and may\nnot be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact\non the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the Index\nmay include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period\nof time, securities of companies that do not align with the\nIndex's objective and/or criteria. When there are changes\nmade to the component securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's\nperformance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's\naverage annual returns for certain time periods compare\nwith the average annual returns of the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based securities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Michael Finocchi. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of\nthe Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Michael Finocchi is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a\ntax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made\nfrom such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n10\n\nSPDR \u00ae Global Dow ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Global Dow ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to      \n  provide investment results that, before fees and   \n  expenses,correspond generally to the total return  \n  performance of an index that tracks the            \n  performance of multinationalblue-chip issuers.     \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.50%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.50%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $51       $160    $280     $628  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 12 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of The Global\nDow (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy,\nwhich means that the Fund is not required to purchase all\nof the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a subset of the securities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nBased on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser\nto be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n11\n\nThe Index is made up of approximately 150 companies from\naround the world. The companies are selected not just based\non size and reputation, but also on their importance in the\nglobal economy. The Index has been designed to cover both\ndeveloped and emerging countries. The Index is equal\nweighted and will be reset to equal weights annually each\nSeptember. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised 151\nstocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a\nforeign currency, there are special risks such as changes\nin currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Investments in\ndepositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Currency\nRisk: The value of the Fund's assets may be affected\nfavorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates,\ncurrency exchange control regulations, and delays,\nrestrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of foreign\ncurrencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have\nsignificant volatility, and changes in the values of\nforeign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in\nsubstantial declines in the values of the Fund's assets\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\n12\n\nDepositary Receipts Risk: Investments in depositary\nreceipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the\nunderlying securities in their primary trading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is denominated in a different currency\nthan its underlying securities, the Fund will be subject to\nthe currency risk of both the investment in the depositary\nreceipt and the underlying security. Holders of depositary\nreceipts may have limited or no rights to take action with\nrespect to the underlying securities or to compel the\nissuer of the receipts to take action. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may differ from the prices of\nsecurities upon which they are based. To the extent the\nFund invests in depositary receipts based on securities\nincluded in the Index, such differences in prices may\nincrease index tracking risk. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks\nof investing in emerging markets include, among others,\ngreater political and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less developed\nsecurities markets, increased potential for market\nmanipulation, possible trade barriers, currency transfer\nrestrictions, a more limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue\nfrom particular commodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation, unavailability of\ncurrency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation, nationalization, embargo, and acts\nof war. The securities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial\nmarket corrections may limit very significantly the\nliquidity of securities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of all\ncompanies in the country or region. The Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its positions in such securities at any time,\nor at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n13\n\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market\nconditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or\nprice or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid investments and may\nbe subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the\nFund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling\nsuch investments, may be unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or sector.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from\nyear to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of\nthe Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Kathleen Morgan, CFA, is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined\nthe Adviser in 2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a\ntax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made\nfrom such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.45%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 21 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the ICE\nExchange-Listed Fixed & Adjustable Rate Preferred\nSecurities Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling\nstrategy, which means that the Fund is not required to\npurchase all of the securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the securities\nin the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities\nwith generally the same risk and return characteristics of\nthe Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be\nbased on a number of factors, including asset size of the\nFund. Based on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser\nto be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in securities that are not included in the Index.\nThe Fund may also invest in cash and cash equivalents or\nmoney market instruments (including money market funds\nadvised by the Adviser) for cash management purposes. In\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of industries, but\nonly to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n16\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of non-\nconvertible preferred stock and securities that are\nfunctionally equivalent to preferred stock, including, but\nnot limited to, senior and subordinated debt (collectively,\n\u201cPreferred Securities\u201d). Preferred Securities generally pay\nfixed rate distributions (but may pay distributions based\non adjustable rates) and typically have \u201cpreference\u201d over\ncommon stock in the payment of distributions and the\nliquidation of a company's assets \u2014 preference means that a\ncompany must pay distributions on its Preferred Securities\nbefore paying dividends on its common stock, and the claims\nof Preferred Securities holders are ahead of common\nstockholders' claims on assets in a corporate liquidation.\nThe Index includes Preferred Securities that meet the\nfollowing criteria: (i) are non-convertible; (ii) have a\npar amount of $25; (iii) are primarily listed on the NYSE\nor NASDAQ exchanges, (iv) have a minimum amount outstanding\nof $250 million; (v) are U.S. dollar denominated; (vi) are\nrated investment grade by one of Moody's Investors Service,\nInc. or S&P Global Ratings ratings services; (vii) are\npublicly registered or exempt from registration under the\nSecurities Act of 1933; (viii) have a fixed or floating\nrate coupon or dividend schedule; (ix) have a minimum\naverage monthly trading volume of at least 250,000 trading\nunits during the preceding six months; and (x) have at\nleast 18 months to final maturity at time of issuance and a\nminimum remaining term to final maturity of at least one\nday. The Index may include securities of companies\nheadquartered outside of the United States. The Index does\nnot include auction rate preferred securities, convertible\npreferred shares, securities with a sinking fund, shares in\nclosed-end funds, purchase units, purchase contracts,\ncorporate pay-in-kind securities and derivative\ninstruments. The Index is market capitalization weighted.\nThe aggregate weight of securities of an individual issuer\nis limited to 5%, and any weight exceeding this limit will\nbe redistributed on a pro-rata basis to securities of\nissuers that do not exceed the 5% limit. In the event the\nIndex includes securities of fewer than 20 issuers, the\naggregate weight of each issuer's securities will be\nequally weighted and the issuer's individual securities\nwill be weighted on a pro-rata basis. The Index is\nrebalanced on the last calendar day of each month based on\ninformation available up to and including the third\nbusiness day before the last business day of the month. As\nof August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in the financial sector, although this\nmay change from time to time. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 154 Preferred Securities. The Index is\nsponsored by ICE Data Indices, LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nPreferred Securities Risk: Generally, Preferred Security\nholders have no or limited voting rights with respect to\nthe issuing company. In addition, Preferred Securities are\ngenerally senior to common stock, but may be subordinated\nto bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital\nstructure and therefore may be subject to greater credit\nrisk than those debt instruments. In the event an issuer of\nPreferred Securities experiences economic difficulties, the\nissuer's Preferred Securities may lose substantial value\ndue to the increased likelihood of deferred interest or\ndividend payments and the fact that the Preferred Security\nmay be subordinated to other securities of the same issuer.\nFurther, because many Preferred Securities pay interest or\ndividends at a fixed rate, their market price can be\nsensitive to changes in interest rates in a manner similar\nto bonds \u2014 that is, as interest rates rise, the value of\nthe Preferred Securities held by the Fund are likely to\ndecline. In addition, to the extent Preferred Securities\nallow holders to convert the Preferred Securities into\ncommon stock of the issuer, their market\n\n17\n\nprice can be sensitive to changes in the value of the\nissuer's common stock and, therefore, declining common\nstock values may also cause the value of the Fund's\ninvestments to decline. Preferred securities often have\ncall features which allow the issuer to redeem the security\nat its discretion. The redemption of a Preferred Security\nhaving a higher than average yield may cause a decrease in\nthe Fund's yield. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nin the secondary market may differ from the Fund's daily\nnet asset value per share and there may be times when the\nmarket price of the shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset value per\nshare (discount). This risk is heightened in times of\nmarket volatility or periods of steep market declines. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The values of debt securities may increase\nor decrease as a result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or\nperceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors\nor liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or\ninterest payments, or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially slower\nthan originally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities to decrease, an adverse impact on the liquidity\nof the Fund's fixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. During periods when\ninterest rates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may\nlose money on an operating basis). To the extent that\ninterest rates fall, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially faster than originally anticipated.\nIf the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before\nexpected, the prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates.\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, the income\nreceived by the Fund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the values of debt\nsecurities of longer durations. Returns on investments in\ndebt securities could trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity securities.\nDepositary Receipts Risk: Investments in depositary\nreceipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the\nunderlying securities in their primary trading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is denominated in a different currency\nthan its underlying securities, the Fund will be subject to\nthe currency risk of both the investment in the depositary\nreceipt and the underlying security. Holders of depositary\nreceipts may have limited or no rights to take action with\nrespect to the underlying securities or to compel the\nissuer of the receipts to take action. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may differ from the prices of\nsecurities upon which they are based. To the extent the\nFund invests in depositary receipts based on securities\nincluded in the Index, such differences in prices may\nincrease index tracking risk. Financial Sector Risk:\nFinancial services companies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation, which may limit both the amounts\nand types of loans and other financial commitments they can\nmake, the interest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can charge and\nthe amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability is\nlargely dependent on the availability and cost of capital\nfunds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates\nchange or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an\nadverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money markets\ngenerally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets. Certain events in the financial\nsector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in\nthe financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause\ncertain financial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures\n\n18\n\ncontract and movements in the price of the underlying\nassets. The counterparty to a futures contract may be\nunable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments,\nreturn the Fund's margin, or otherwise honor its\nobligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with an indexing investment strategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index\nof securities, regardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual securities\ncomprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed\nfund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active\ninvestment strategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Index and, consequently, the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to time and may\nnot be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact\non the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the Index\nmay include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period\nof time, securities of companies that do not align with the\nIndex's objective and/or criteria. When there are changes\nmade to the component securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S.\nsecurities (including depositary receipts) are subject to\npolitical, regulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less information\npublicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial report standards\ncomparable to those in the United States. Further, such\nentities and/or their securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls; expropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater market volatility; differing\nsecurities market structures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as delays in\nclearing and settling portfolio transactions or in\nreceiving payment of dividends. To the extent underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that\nare closed when the exchange on which the Fund's shares\ntrade is open, there may be deviations between the current\nprice of an underlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed foreign market.\nThese deviations could result in the Fund experiencing\npremiums or discounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Securities traded on foreign\nmarkets may be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities\ntraded domestically. Foreign governments may impose\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Investments in\ndepositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the\nFund will perform in the future.

Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective May 1, 2021 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Wells Fargo Hybrid and Preferred Securities Aggregate\nIndex (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the ICE Exchange-Listed Fixed & Adjustable Rate Preferred\nSecurities Index, consistent with a change in the Fund's principal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index. Performance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date is\ntherefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the Previous Benchmark Index and may have been\ndifferent had the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                                                                   \n                                                     OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                9.06%    2.34%      4.02%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                6.93%    0.52%      2.12%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of    6.00%    1.36%      2.59%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                      \n  ICE Exchange-Listed Fixed & Adjustable Rate                                      \n  Preferred Securities Index/Wells Fargo Hybrid      9.35%    2.64%      4.35%     \n  andPreferred Securities Aggregate Index1(reflects                                \n  no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                        \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,     26.29%   15.69%     12.03%    \n  expenses or taxes)                                                               \n                                                                                   \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the Index for periods beginning on the Benchmark Index Change Date and the\nPrevious Benchmark Index for periods prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date. Portfolio Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio Managers The\nprofessionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl Schneider, Amy\nScofield and Michael Finocchi. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of\nthe Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Amy Scofield is a Principal\nof the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 2010.\nMichael Finocchi is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity\nBeta Group. He joined the Adviser in 2005.\n\n20\n\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n21\n\nSPDR \u00ae MSCI USA StrategicFactors SM ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactorsSMETF (the       \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the total return performance of an index based     \n  upon the U.S.equity market.                        \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.15%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 13 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the MSCI\nUSA Factor Mix A-Series Capped Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n22\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the equity market\nperformance of large-and mid-cap companies across the U.S.\nequity market. It aims to represent the performance of a\ncombination of three factors: value, quality, and low\nvolatility. The Index is an equal weighted combination of\nthe following three MSCI Factor Indices in a single\ncomposite index: the MSCI USA Value Weighted Index, the\nMSCI USA Quality Index, and the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility\nIndex (each, a \u201cComponent Index\u201d). If the MSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Index is not available due to the concentrated\nnature of its underlying parent index (for example, in the\nevent of a low number of stocks or where a relatively few\nnumber of constituents constitutes a large proportion of\nindex weight), the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index is\nreplaced with the MSCI USA Risk Weighted Index (if used to\nreplace the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index, also a\n\u201cComponent Index\u201d) and the Index is an equal weighted\ncombination of the MSCI USA Value Weighted Index, the MSCI\nUSA Quality Index and the MSCI USA Risk Weighted Index. The\nIndex Provider (defined below) determines if such\nreplacement is necessary and reviews the MSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Index for viability on a regular basis. The MSCI\nUSA Value Weighted Index includes publicly-traded companies\ndomiciled in the U.S., weighted to emphasize stocks with\nlower valuations, by giving higher index weight to stocks\nwith higher values of fundamental variables such as sales,\nearnings, cash earnings and book value. The MSCI USA\nQuality Index includes publicly-traded companies domiciled\nin the U.S., weighted to emphasize stocks with historically\nhigh return on equity, stable year-over-year earnings\ngrowth, and low financial leverage. The MSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Index aims to reflect the performance\ncharacteristics of a minimum variance strategy applied to\npublicly-traded companies domiciled in the U.S. and is\nweighted to provide the lowest absolute risk within a given\nset of constraints. The MSCI USA Risk Weighted Index\nincludes publicly-traded companies domiciled in the U.S.,\nand reweights the constituents so that stocks with lower\nvolatility, measured as the weekly return variance over the\nprior three years, are given higher index weight. Each\nComponent Index is attributed equal weight (1/3) at each\nrebalancing. All constituents of each Component Index are\nincluded in the Index. The weight of each security in the\nIndex is determined based on 1) the security's weight in\neach underlying Component Index; and 2) the weight of each\nunderlying Component Index in the Index. The Index is then\nsubject to the MSCI A-Series Index Methodology. The MSCI\nA-Series Index Methodology first seeks to ensure the Index\nincludes at least 25 constituents. In the event the Index\ndoes not contain at least 25 constituents, the Index is\nsupplemented by including constituents of the MSCI USA\nSmall Cap Index, selected in decreasing order based on full\nmarket capitalization, until the target of 25 constituents\nis reached. The MSCI A-Series Index Methodology then\napplies the MSCI 25/50 Index Methodology, which aims to\nreflect 5/25/50 weight constraints (i.e., no issuer has a\nweight above 25%, and the sum of weights of all issuers\nwith weights above 5% does not exceed 50%). The Index is\nrebalanced semi-annually, usually as of the close of the\nlast business day of May and November, coinciding with the\nsemi-annual index reviews of the MSCI Global Investable\nMarket Indices and of each Component Index. As of August\n31, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised\ncompanies in the technology, health care and financial\nsectors, although this may change from time to time. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, the Index comprised 601 securities. The\nIndex is sponsored by MSCI, Inc. (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\n\n23\n\nLarge-Capitalization Securities Risk: Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail\nthe returns on investments in securities of smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Larger companies may be unable to\nrespond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in business, product,\nfinancial, or other market conditions. Larger companies may\nnot be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies. Mid-Capitalization Securities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-capitalization companies may be more\nvolatile and may involve more risk than the securities of\nlarger companies. These companies may have limited product\nlines, markets or financial resources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of larger companies, and may depend on\na few key employees. In addition, these companies may have\nbeen recently organized and may have little or no track\nrecord of success. The securities of mid-sized companies\nmay trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Some securities of mid-sized\nissuers may be illiquid or may be restricted as to resale,\nand their values may be volatile. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Financial Sector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which may limit both the amounts and types of\nloans and other financial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of\nthe credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in\na broad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Health\nCare Sector Risk: Companies in the health care sector are\nsubject to extensive government regulation and their\nprofitability can be significantly affected by restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising\ncosts of medical products and services, pricing pressure\n(including price discounting), limited product lines and an\nincreased emphasis on the delivery of healthcare through\noutpatient services. Companies in the health care sector\nare heavily dependent on obtaining and defending patents,\nwhich may be time consuming and costly, and the expiration\nof patents may also adversely affect the profitability of\nthese companies. Health care companies are also subject to\nextensive litigation based on product liability and similar\nclaims. In addition, their products can become obsolete due\nto industry innovation, changes in technologies or other\nmarket developments. Many new products in the health care\nsector require significant research and development and may\nbe subject to regulatory approvals, all of which may be\ntime consuming and costly with no guarantee that any\nproduct will come to market.\n\n24\n\nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed\nwith an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track\nthe performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Low Volatility Risk: Although\nsubject to the risks of common stocks, low volatility\nstocks are seen as having a lower risk profile than the\noverall markets. However, a portfolio comprised of low\nvolatility stocks may not produce investment exposure that\nhas lower variability to changes in such stocks' price\nlevels. Low volatility stocks are likely to underperform\nthe broader market during periods of rapidly rising stock\nprices. Quality Risk: A \u201cquality\u201d style of investing\nemphasizes companies with high returns on equity, stable\nearnings per share growth, and low financial leverage. This\nstyle of investing is subject to the risk that the past\nperformance of these companies does not continue or that\nthe returns on \u201cquality\u201d equity securities are less than\nreturns on other styles of investing or the overall stock\nmarket. Technology Sector Risk: Market or economic factors\nimpacting technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances could have a major effect\non the value of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks\nof technology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both domestically\nand internationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Technology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time.\n\n25\n\nValue Stock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style of investing is subject\nto the risk that the returns on \u201cvalue\u201d equity securities\nare less than returns on other styles of investing or the\noverall stock market. Value stocks present the risk that\nthey may decline in price or never reach their expected\nfull market value because the market fails to recognize a\nstock's intrinsic worth. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's\nperformance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's\naverage annual returns for certain time periods compare\nwith the average annual returns of the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based securities index.

After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                                                                       \n                                                   OneYear  FiveYears  SinceInception  \n  4/15/2015                                                                            \n  Return Before Taxes                              21.81%   14.52%     11.52%          \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions              21.34%   14.04%     10.99%          \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of  13.22%   11.59%     9.32%           \n  Fund Shares                                                                          \n  MSCI USA Factor Mix A-Series Capped Index                                            \n  (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or     21.85%   14.70%     11.70%          \n  taxes)                                                                               \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,   26.29%   15.69%     11.90%          \n  expenses or taxes)                                                                   \n                                                                                       \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and John Law. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. John Law, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2016. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\n\n26\n\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund\nShares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to\naccept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n27\n\nSPDR \u00ae NYSE Technology ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR NYSE Technology ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to  \n  provide investment results that, before fees        \n  andexpenses, correspond generally to the total      \n  return performance of an index that tracks the      \n  performance ofpublicly traded technology            \n  companies.                                          \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 8 % of the average value\nof its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\nIn seeking to track the performance of the NYSE Technology\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy,\nwhich means that the Fund is not required to purchase all\nof the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a subset of the securities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nBased on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser\nto be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n28\n\nThe Index is composed of 35 leading U.S.-listed technology-\nrelated companies. The investible universe of the Index\ncomprises all stocks in the Technology sector and\ntechnology-related stocks in the Consumer Discretionary\nsector, as defined by the Index Provider (as defined below)\nthat are listed on major U.S. stock exchanges and meet the\nfollowing criteria as of the index rebalance reference\ndate: (i) issued by a company with a minimum market\ncapitalization of $2 billion and (ii) have a trailing\n3-month average daily traded value of $10 million. Stocks\nmust also meet at least one of the following three revenue-\nand sales-based criteria: (i) sales from the latest quarter\nincreased compared to sales from the same quarter of the\nprevious year, (ii) have only one consecutive quarter of\nnegative sales growth over the last two years, or (iii)\nhave revenue totals from the last four quarters that\nclassify it within the top 75 companies within the specific\nindustry classification designated to it by the Index\nProvider. Eligible stocks are then ranked based on market\ncapitalization and liquidity, and the top 35 stocks are\nselected for inclusion in the Index. At least 75% of the\ncompanies included in the Index must be headquartered in\nthe United States. The Index is equal-weighted and\nrebalanced annually after the close of trading on the third\nFriday of December. As of July 31, 2024 the Index comprised\n35 stocks. The Index is sponsored by ICE Data Indices, LLC\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Technology Sector Risk: Market or economic factors\nimpacting technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances could have a major effect\non the value of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks\nof technology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both domestically\nand internationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Technology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so.\n\n29\n\nConsumer Discretionary Sector Risk: The success of consumer\nproduct manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the\nperformance of the overall global economy, interest rates,\ncompetition and consumer confidence. Success depends\nheavily on disposable household income and consumer\nspending. Also, companies in the consumer discretionary\nsector may be subject to severe competition, which may have\nan adverse impact on their respective profitability.\nChanges in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect\nthe demand for, and success of, consumer products and\nservices in the marketplace. Futures Contract Risk: A\nfutures contract is a standardized agreement that calls for\nthe purchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific\nprice at a specific future time, or cash settlement of the\nterms of the contract. Transactions in futures contracts\ncan create investment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures contract\ntransaction will result in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable time or\nprice. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market\non an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n30\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Kathleen Morgan. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of\nthe Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Kathleen Morgan, CFA, is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined\nthe Adviser in 2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n31\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n32\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio S&P 1500 Composite Stock Market ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P 1500 Composite Stock Market  \n  ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide                   \n  investmentresults that, before fees and expenses,   \n  correspond generally to the total return            \n  performance of an index thattracks a broad          \n  universe of exchange traded U.S. equity             \n  securities.                                         \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.03%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 3 % of the average value\nof its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\nIn seeking to track the performance of the S&P Composite\n1500 Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling\nstrategy, which means that the Fund is not required to\npurchase all of the securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the securities\nin the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities\nwith generally the same risk and return characteristics of\nthe Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be\nbased on a number of factors, including asset size of the\nFund. Based on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser\nto be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex (including common stock, preferred stock, depositary\nreceipts and shares of other investment companies). The\nFund may also invest in cash and cash equivalents or money\nmarket instruments (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in\nan industry or group of industries, but only to the extent\nthat the Index concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. Futures contracts (a type of\nderivative instrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to the Index and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n33\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of the\nbroad exchange-traded U.S. equity securities universe. The\nIndex consists of those stocks included in the S&P 500\nIndex, the S&P MidCap 400 Index, and the S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex. Each underlying index includes U.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX that meet\nspecific market capitalization requirements. To be included\nin an underlying index, a security (or issuer of a\nsecurity, as applicable) should (i) have an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-adjusted market capitalization ratio\nof 0.75 or greater at the time of addition to the Index;\n(ii) trade a minimum of 250,000 shares in each of the six\nmonths leading up to the evaluation date; (iii) have a\npublic float of at least 10%; and (iv) have positive\naggregate earnings over the four most recent quarters and\nfor the most recent quarter. The Index is float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization weighted. Index constituents are\nadded and removed on an as-needed basis. The Index is\nrebalanced on a quarterly basis in March, June, September\nand December. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion\nof the Fund comprised companies in the technology sector,\nalthough this may change from time to time. As of July 31,\n2024, the Index comprised 1,506 stocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than\n\n34\n\nthat of a portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the Index will\naffect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index\nand, consequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Technology Sector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological advances could\nhave a major effect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable\nto rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and internationally,\nincluding competition from foreign competitors with lower\nproduction costs. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology, especially those\nof smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more\nvolatile than the overall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual property\nrights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely\naffect profitability. Additionally, companies in the\ntechnology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for the services of\nqualified personnel. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets within one\nor more economic sectors or industries, which may change\nfrom time to time. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential for\nvolatility and the risk that events negatively affecting\nsuch sectors or industries could reduce returns,\npotentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly.\n\n35\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Effective November 16, 2017,\nthe Fund's benchmark index changed from the Russell 3000 Index to the SSGA Total Stock Market Index.\nEffective January 24, 2020, the Fund's benchmark index changed from the SSGA Total Stock Market Index to the\nS&P Composite 1500 Index. Each benchmark index change was consistent with a change in the Fund's principal\ninvestment strategy to track the performance of a new index. Performance of the Fund prior to January 24,\n2020 is therefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the applicable prior indexes and may have\nbeen different had the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                                                                    \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                 25.48%   15.50%     11.64%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 24.99%   15.03%     11.14%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     15.34%   12.41%     9.52%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                       \n  S&P Composite 1500 Index/SSGA Total Stock Market                                  \n  Index/Russell 3000 Index/Dow Jones U.S.Total Stock  25.47%   15.53%     11.66%    \n  Market Index1(reflects no deduction for fees,                                     \n  expenses or taxes)                                                                \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,      26.29%   15.69%     12.03%    \n  expenses or taxes)                                                                \n                                                                                    \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the S&P Composite 1500 Index for the period from January 24, 2020 to\nDecember 31, 2022, the SSGA Total Stock Market Index for the period from November 16, 2017 to January 23,\n2020, the Russell 3000 Index for the period from July 9, 2013 to November 15, 2017, and the Dow Jones U.S.\nTotal Stock Market Index for periods prior to July 9, 2013. Portfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM\nserves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio Managers The professionals primarily responsible for\nthe day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl Schneider and Kathleen Morgan. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a\nManaging Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined\nthe Adviser in 1997. Kathleen Morgan, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager\nin the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 2017.\n\n36\n\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n37\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio S&P 400 Mid Cap ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P 400 Mid Cap ETF (the        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  before feesand expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the total return performance of an index that      \n  tracks the performanceof mid-capitalization        \n  exchange traded U.S. equity securities.            \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.03%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 20 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nMidCap 400 Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling\nstrategy, which means that the Fund is not required to\npurchase all of the securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the securities\nin the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities\nwith generally the same risk and return characteristics of\nthe Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be\nbased on a number of factors, including asset size of the\nFund. Based on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser\nto be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n38\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of the\nmid-capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. The\nselection universe for the Index includes all U.S. common\nequities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American,\nNASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ\nCapital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX\nwith unadjusted market capitalizations between $6.7 billion\nand $18 billion and float-adjusted market capitalizations\nof at least $3.35 billion at the time of inclusion. These\ncapitalization ranges may be revised by the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at any time. To be included in the\nIndex, a security (or issuer of a security, as applicable)\nshould (i) have an annual dollar value traded to float-\nadjusted market capitalization ratio of 0.75 or greater at\nthe time of addition to the S&P Composite 1500 Index (the\nIndex's parent index); (ii) trade a minimum of 250,000\nshares in each of the six months leading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii) have a public float of at least 10%;\nand (iv) have positive aggregate earnings over the four\nmost recent quarters and for the most recent quarter. In\nselecting securities for inclusion in the Index, the Index\nProvider also considers sector balance by comparing the\nweight of each GICS (Global Industry Classification\nStandard) sector in the Index to its weight in the relevant\nmarket capitalization range of the S&P Total Market Index.\nThe Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted.\nIndex constituents are added and removed on an as-needed\nbasis. The Index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September and December. As of August 31, 2024,\na significant portion of the Fund comprised companies in\nthe industrial and financial sectors, although this may\nchange from time to time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index\ncomprised 401 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time. Mid-\nCapitalization Securities Risk: The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation, which may limit both the\namounts and types of loans and other financial commitments\nthey can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge,\nthe scope of their activities, the prices they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds and can fluctuate\n\n39\n\nsignificantly when interest rates change or due to\nincreased competition. In addition, deterioration of the\ncredit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs.\n\n40\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from\nyear to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the\nFund will perform in the future. Updated performance\ninformation is available by calling 1-866-787-2257 or\nvisiting our website at https://www.ssga.com .\n\nAnnual Total Returns (years ended 12/31)\n                                                   \n                            Returns  Quarter/Year  \n  Highest Quarterly Return  24.31%   Q4 2020       \n  Lowest Quarterly Return   -29.75%  Q1 2020       \n  Year-to-Date              13.47%   9/30/2024     \n                                                   \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods ended 12/31/23) The after-tax returns presented in the table below\nare calculated using highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the\nimpact of state and local taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective July 9, 2013, the Fund's benchmark index\nchanged from the Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index to the Russell Small Cap Completeness\nIndex. Effective August 31, 2016, the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Russell Small Cap Completeness\nIndex to the S&P 1000 Index. Effective January 24, 2020, the Fund's benchmark index changed from the S&P\n1000 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index. Each benchmark index change was consistent with a change in the\nFund's principal investment strategy to track the performance of a new index. Performance of the Fund prior\nto January 24, 2020 is therefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the applicable prior\nindexes and may have been different had the Fund tracked the current index. 41\n                                                                                    \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                 16.42%   12.36%     8.53%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 15.89%   11.87%     7.73%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     9.90%    9.74%      6.60%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                       \n  S&P MidCap 400 Index/S&P 1000 Index/Russell Small                                 \n  Cap Completeness Index/Dow Jones U.S.Mid-Cap Total  16.44%   12.42%     8.58%     \n  Stock Market Index1(reflects no deduction for                                     \n  fees, expenses or taxes)                                                          \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,      26.29%   15.69%     12.03%    \n  expenses or taxes)                                                                \n                                                                                    \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the S&P MidCap 400 Index for the period January 24, 2020 to December 31,\n2022, the S&P 1000 Index for the period from August 31, 2016 to January 23, 2020, the Russell Small Cap\nCompleteness Index for the period from July 9, 2013 to August 30, 2016, and the Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total\nStock Market Index for periods prior to July 9, 2013.

Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the\nAdviser in 1997. Mark Krivitsky is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group and the Tax-Efficient Market Capture Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996.\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n42\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio S&P 500 \u00ae ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks   \n  to provide investment results that, before fees     \n  andexpenses, correspond generally to the total      \n  return performance of an index that tracks the      \n  performance oflarge capitalization exchange traded  \n  U.S. equity securities.                             \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.02%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.02%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $2          $6     $11      $26  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 3 % of the average value\nof its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\nIn seeking to track the performance of the S&P 500 Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which\nmeans that the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the\nIndex in approximately the same proportions as the Index,\nas determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index (including common stock,\npreferred stock, depositary receipts and shares of other\ninvestment companies). The Fund may also invest in cash and\ncash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n43\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of the\nlarge-capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. The\nselection universe for the Index includes all U.S. common\nequities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American,\nNASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ\nCapital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX\nwith unadjusted market capitalizations of at least $18\nbillion and float-adjusted market capitalizations of at\nleast $9 billion at the time of inclusion. These\ncapitalization ranges may be revised by the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at any time. To be included in the\nIndex, a security (or issuer of a security, as applicable)\nshould (i) have an annual dollar value traded to float-\nadjusted market capitalization ratio of 0.75 or greater at\nthe time of addition to the S&P Composite 1500 Index (the\nIndex's parent index); (ii) trade a minimum of 250,000\nshares in each of the six months leading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii) have a public float of at least 10%;\nand (iv) have positive aggregate earnings over the four\nmost recent quarters and for the most recent quarter. In\nselecting securities for inclusion in the Index, the Index\nProvider also considers sector balance by comparing the\nweight of each GICS (Global Industry Classification\nStandard) sector in the Index to its weight in the relevant\nmarket capitalization range of the S&P Total Market Index.\nThe Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted.\nIndex constituents are added and removed on an as-needed\nbasis. The Index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September and December. As of August 31, 2024,\na significant portion of the Fund comprised companies in\nthe technology sector, although this may change from time\nto time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised 503\nstocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Large-Capitalization Securities Risk: Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail\nthe returns on investments in securities of smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Larger companies may be unable to\nrespond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in business, product,\nfinancial, or other market conditions. Larger companies may\nnot be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market\n\n44\n\nexists, it might not be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and the Fund will be unable to terminate its\nexposure to the futures contract. There is also a risk of\nimperfect correlation between movements in the prices of\nthe futures contract and movements in the price of the\nunderlying assets. The counterparty to a futures contract\nmay be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement\npayments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise honor its\nobligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with an indexing investment strategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index\nof securities, regardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual securities\ncomprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed\nfund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active\ninvestment strategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Index and, consequently, the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to time and may\nnot be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact\non the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the Index\nmay include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period\nof time, securities of companies that do not align with the\nIndex's objective and/or criteria. When there are changes\nmade to the component securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Technology Sector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological advances could\nhave a major effect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable\nto rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and internationally,\nincluding competition from foreign competitors with lower\nproduction costs. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology, especially those\nof smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more\nvolatile than the overall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual property\nrights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely\naffect profitability. Additionally, companies in the\ntechnology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for the services of\nqualified personnel. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets within one\nor more economic sectors or industries, which may change\nfrom time to time. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential for\nvolatility and the risk that events negatively affecting\nsuch sectors or industries could reduce returns,\npotentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly.\n\n45\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the\nFund will perform in the future.

Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective July 9, 2013, the Fund's benchmark index\nchanged from the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index to the Russell 1000 Index. Effective\nNovember 16, 2017, the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Russell 1000 Index to the SSGA Large Cap\nIndex. Effective January 24, 2020, the Fund's benchmark index changed from the SSGA Large Cap Index to the\nS&P 500 Index. Each benchmark index change was consistent with a change in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of a new index. Performance of the Fund prior to January 24, 2020 is\ntherefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the applicable prior indexes and may have been\ndifferent had the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                                                                    \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                 26.26%   15.79%     11.92%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 25.77%   15.30%     11.37%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     15.81%   12.64%     9.72%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                       \n  S&P 500 Index/SSGA Large Cap Index/Russell 1000                                   \n  Index/Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total StockMarket    26.29%   15.84%     11.97%    \n  Index1(reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or                                \n  taxes)                                                                            \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,      26.29%   15.69%     12.03%    \n  expenses or taxes)                                                                \n                                                                                    \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the S&P 500 Index for the period January 24, 2020 to December 31, 2022,\nthe SSGA Large Cap Index for the period from November 16, 2017 to January 23, 2020, the Russell 1000 Index\nfor the period from July 9, 2013 to November 15, 2017, and the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market\nIndex for periods prior to July 9, 2013.

Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).

The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be\nbased on a number of factors, including asset size of the\nFund. Based on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser\nto be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n48\n\nThe Index measures the performance of the large-\ncapitalization growth segment of the U.S. equity market.\nThe Index consists of those stocks in the S&P 500 Index\nexhibiting the strongest growth characteristics based on:\n(i) sales growth; (ii) changes in earnings over price; and\n(iii) momentum. The S&P 500 Index focuses on the large\ncapitalization U.S. equity market, including common stock\nand real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d). The selection\nuniverse for the S&P 500 Index includes all U.S. common\nequities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American,\nNASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ\nCapital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX\nwith unadjusted market capitalizations of at least $18\nbillion and float-adjusted market capitalizations of at\nleast $9 billion at the time of inclusion. The minimum\nrequired capitalization may be revised by the Index\nProvider (as defined below) at any time. To be included in\nthe Index, a security (or issuer of a security, as\napplicable) should (i) have an annual dollar value traded\nto float-adjusted market capitalization ratio of 0.75 or\ngreater at the time of addition to the S&P Composite 1500\nIndex (the Index's parent index); (ii) trade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii) have a public float of at least 10%;\nand (iv) have positive as-reported earnings over the most\nrecent four consecutive quarters (measured using the sum of\nearnings over those quarters) and for the most recent\nquarter. Meeting these criteria does not guarantee\nautomatic inclusion into the Index. Given the limited\nnumber of companies that the Index can have and that it\nmust reflect sector representation, some eligible companies\nmay not be added to the Index at a particular time. S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC's Index Committee makes the final\ndetermination and approval of all Index constituents. The\nIndex is market capitalization weighted, subject to capping\nrequirements to comply with the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The Index is reconstituted\nannually after the close of business on the third Friday of\nDecember and rebalances quarterly after the close of\nbusiness on the third Friday of March, June, September and\nDecember. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of\nthe Fund comprised companies in the technology sector,\nalthough this may change from time to time. As of July 31,\n2024, the Index comprised 231 stocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Growth Stock Risk: The prices of growth stocks may be\nbased largely on expectations of future earnings, and their\nprices can decline rapidly and significantly in reaction to\nnegative news. Growth stocks may underperform value stocks\nand stocks in other broad style categories (and the stock\nmarket as a whole) over any period of time and may shift in\nand out of favor with investors generally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on changes in market, economic, and\nother factors. Large-Capitalization Securities Risk:\nReturns on investments in securities of large companies\ncould trail the returns on investments in securities of\nsmaller and mid-sized companies. Larger companies may be\nunable to respond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies to competitive challenges or to changes in\nbusiness, product, financial, or other market conditions.\nLarger companies may not be able to maintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be achieved by well-managed smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\n\n49\n\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of\nportfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent\nthe Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular security held\nby the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested\nin a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may\nbe more volatile than the values of shares of more\ndiversified funds. The Fund may become diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of tracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Technology Sector Risk: Market or economic\nfactors impacting technology companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technological advances could have a major\neffect on the value of the Fund's investments. The value of\nstocks of technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, including competition\nfrom foreign competitors with lower production costs.\nStocks of technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are heavily dependent\non patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\n\n50\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from\nyear to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Mark Krivitsky. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Mark Krivitsky is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group and the Tax-\nEfficient Market Capture Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash.\n\n51\n\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund\nShares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to\naccept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n52\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio S&P 500 \u00ae High Dividend ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (the  \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results        \n  that,before fees and expenses, correspond          \n  generally to the total return performance of an    \n  index that tracks theperformance of publicly       \n  traded issuers that have high dividend yields.     \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.07%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.07%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $7         $23     $40      $90  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 43 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P 500\nHigh Dividend Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n53\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of 80 high\ndividend-yielding companies within the S&P 500 \u00ae Index. The\nS&P 500 Index focuses on the large capitalization U.S.\nequity market, including common stock and real estate\ninvestment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d). The selection universe for the\nS&P 500 Index includes all U.S. common equities listed on\nthe NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe\nBZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX with unadjusted\nmarket capitalizations of at least $18 billion and float-\nadjusted market capitalizations of at least $9 billion at\nthe time of inclusion. The minimum required capitalization\nmay be revised by the Index Provider (as defined below) at\nany time. To determine dividend yield: (i) an indicated\ndividend is measured by taking the latest dividend paid\n(excluding special payments) multiplied by the annual\nfrequency of the payment; and (ii) the indicated dividend\nis then divided by the company's share price as of the\nrebalancing reference date. Index constituents are equally\nweighted and the Index is rebalanced semi-annually, in\nJanuary and July. As of August 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Fund comprised companies in the financial\nand real estate sectors, although this may change from time\nto time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised 75\nstocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Dividend Paying Securities Risk: Securities that pay\ndividends, as a group, can fall out of favor with the\nmarket, causing such companies to underperform companies\nthat do not pay dividends. In addition, changes in the\ndividend policies of the companies held by the Fund or the\ncapital resources available for such company's dividend\npayments may adversely affect the Fund. Large-\nCapitalization Securities Risk: Returns on investments in\nsecurities of large companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger companies may be unable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to competitive\nchallenges or to changes in business, product, financial,\nor other market conditions. Larger companies may not be\nable to maintain growth at the high rates that may be\nachieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation, which may limit both the\namounts and types of loans and other financial commitments\nthey can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge,\nthe scope of their activities, the prices they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an\nadverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money markets\ngenerally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets.\n\n54\n\nCertain events in the financial sector may cause an\nunusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Real Estate Sector Risk: An\ninvestment in a real property company may be subject to\nrisks similar to those associated with direct ownership of\nreal estate, including, by way of example, the possibility\nof declines in the value of real estate, losses from\ncasualty or condemnation, and changes in local and general\neconomic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates,\nenvironmental liability, zoning laws, regulatory\nlimitations on rents, property taxes, and operating\nexpenses. Some real property companies have limited\ndiversification because they invest in a limited number of\nproperties, a narrow geographic area, or a single type of\nproperty. REIT Risk: Real estate investment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d) are subject to the risks associated with\ninvesting in the securities of real property companies. In\nparticular, REITs may be affected by changes in the values\nof the underlying properties that they own or operate.\nFurther, REITs are dependent upon specialized management\nskills, and their investments may be concentrated in\nrelatively few properties, or in a small geographic area or\na single property type. REITs are also subject to heavy\ncash flow dependency and, as a result, are particularly\nreliant on the proper functioning of capital markets. A\nvariety of economic and other factors may adversely affect\na lessee's ability to meet its obligations to a REIT. In\nthe event of a default by a lessee, the REIT may experience\ndelays in\n\n55\n\nenforcing its rights as a lessor and may incur substantial\ncosts associated in protecting its investments. In\naddition, a REIT could fail to qualify for favorable\nregulatory treatment. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets within one\nor more economic sectors or industries, which may change\nfrom time to time. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential for\nvolatility and the risk that events negatively affecting\nsuch sectors or industries could reduce returns,\npotentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly. Fund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and table provide an indication of the\nrisks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the\nFund's performance from year to year and by showing how the\nFund's average annual returns for certain time periods\ncompare with the average annual returns of the Index and of\na relevant broad-based securities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and John Law. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. John Law, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2016.\n\n56\n\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n57\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio S&P 500 \u00ae Value ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)  \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before   \n  feesand expenses, correspond generally to the      \n  total return performance of an index that tracks   \n  the performanceof large capitalization exchange    \n  traded U.S. equity securities exhibiting\u201cvalue\u201d    \n  characteristics.                                   \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.04%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.04%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $4         $13     $23      $51  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 33 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P 500\nValue Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling\nstrategy, which means that the Fund is not required to\npurchase all of the securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the securities\nin the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities\nwith generally the same risk and return characteristics of\nthe Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be\nbased on a number of factors, including asset size of the\nFund. Based on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser\nto be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n58\n\nThe Index measures the performance of the large-\ncapitalization value segment of the U.S. equity market. The\nIndex consists of those stocks in the S&P 500 Index\nexhibiting the strongest value characteristics based on:\n(i) book value to price ratio; (ii) earnings to price\nratio; and (iii) sales to price ratio. The S&P 500 Index\nfocuses on the large capitalization U.S. equity market,\nincluding common stock and real estate investment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d). The selection universe for the S&P 500 Index\nincludes all U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX with unadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at least $18 billion and float-adjusted\nmarket capitalizations of at least $9 billion at the time\nof inclusion. The minimum required capitalization may be\nrevised by the Index Provider (as defined below) at any\ntime. To be included in the Index, a security (or issuer of\na security, as applicable) should (i) have an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-adjusted market capitalization ratio\nof 0.75 or greater at the time of addition to the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index (the Index's parent index); (ii) trade\na minimum of 250,000 shares in each of the six months\nleading up to the evaluation date; (iii) have a public\nfloat of at least 10%; and (iv) have positive as-reported\nearnings over the most recent four consecutive quarters\n(measured using the sum of earnings over those quarters)\nand for the most recent quarter. Meeting these criteria\ndoes not guarantee automatic inclusion into the Index.\nGiven the limited number of companies that the Index can\nhave and that it must reflect sector representation, some\neligible companies may not be added to the Index at a\nparticular time. S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC's Index\nCommittee makes the final determination and approval of all\nIndex constituents. The Index is market capitalization\nweighted, subject to capping requirements to comply with\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nThe Index is reconstituted annually after the close of\nbusiness on the third Friday of December and rebalances\nquarterly after the close of business on the third Friday\nof March, June, September and December. As of August 31,\n2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies\nin the health care and financial sectors, although this may\nchange from time to time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index\ncomprised 438 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nValue Stock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style of investing is subject\nto the risk that the returns on \u201cvalue\u201d equity securities\nare less than returns on other styles of investing or the\noverall stock market. Value stocks present the risk that\nthey may decline in price or never reach their expected\nfull market value because the market fails to recognize a\nstock's intrinsic worth. Large-Capitalization Securities\nRisk: Returns on investments in securities of large\ncompanies could trail the returns on investments in\nsecurities of smaller and mid-sized companies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable to respond as quickly as smaller\nand mid-sized companies to competitive challenges or to\nchanges in business, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high rates that may be achieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and mid-sized companies. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times\n\n59\n\nwhen the market price of the shares is more than the net\nasset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is heightened in\ntimes of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Financial Sector Risk: Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive governmental regulation,\nwhich may limit both the amounts and types of loans and\nother financial commitments they can make, the interest\nrates and fees they can charge, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of\nthe credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in\na broad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Health\nCare Sector Risk: Companies in the health care sector are\nsubject to extensive government regulation and their\nprofitability can be significantly affected by restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising\ncosts of medical products and services, pricing pressure\n(including price discounting), limited product lines and an\nincreased emphasis on the delivery of healthcare through\noutpatient services. Companies in the health care sector\nare heavily dependent on obtaining and defending patents,\nwhich may be time consuming and costly, and the expiration\nof patents may also adversely affect the profitability of\nthese companies. Health care companies are also subject to\nextensive litigation based on product liability and similar\nclaims. In addition, their products can become obsolete due\nto industry innovation, changes in technologies or other\nmarket developments. Many new products in the health care\nsector require significant research and development and may\nbe subject to regulatory approvals, all of which may be\ntime consuming and costly with no guarantee that any\nproduct will come to market. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the performance of\nan unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current\nor projected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\n\n60\n\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets within one\nor more economic sectors or industries, which may change\nfrom time to time. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential for\nvolatility and the risk that events negatively affecting\nsuch sectors or industries could reduce returns,\npotentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Mark Krivitsky. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997.\n\n61\n\nMark Krivitsky is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity\nBeta Group and the Tax-Efficient Market Capture Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through\nyour broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k)\nplan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be\ntaxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services\nrelated to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another\ninvestment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n62\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap ETF (the      \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the total return performance of an index that      \n  tracks theperformance of small capitalization      \n  exchange traded U.S. equity securities.            \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.03%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 24 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n63\n\nThe Index measures the performance of the small-\ncapitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. The\nselection universe for the Index includes all U.S. common\nequities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American,\nNASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ\nCapital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX\nwith unadjusted market capitalizations between $1 billion\nand $6.7 billion and float-adjusted market capitalizations\nof at least $500 million at the time of inclusion. These\ncapitalization ranges may be revised by the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at any time. To be included in the\nIndex, a security (or issuer of a security, as applicable)\nshould (i) have an annual dollar value traded to float-\nadjusted market capitalization ratio of 0.75 or greater at\nthe time of addition to the S&P Composite 1500 Index (the\nIndex's parent index); (ii) trade a minimum of 250,000\nshares in each of the six months leading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii) have a public float of at least 10%;\nand (iv) have positive aggregate earnings over the four\nmost recent quarters and for the most recent quarter. In\nselecting securities for inclusion in the Index, the Index\nProvider also considers sector balance by comparing the\nweight of each GICS (Global Industry Classification\nStandard) sector in the Index to its weight in the relevant\nmarket capitalization range of the S&P Total Market Index.\nThe Index is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted.\nIndex constituents are added and removed on an as-needed\nbasis. The Index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September and December. As of August 31, 2024,\na significant portion of the Fund comprised companies in\nthe financial and industrial sectors, although this may\nchange from time to time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index\ncomprised 602 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of smaller companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may have\nsignificant volatility. The Fund may be unable to liquidate\nits positions in such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations.\nReturns on investments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger companies. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought\nand sold in the secondary market at market prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of the shares is\nmore than the net asset value per share (premium) or less\nthan the net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines.\n\n64\n\nFinancial Sector Risk: Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation, which may\nlimit both the amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the interest rates and\nfees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the\nprices they can charge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the\navailability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change or due to\nincreased competition. In addition, deterioration of the\ncredit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies\n\n65\n\nare heavily influenced by governmental defense spending\npolicies which are typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol the U.S. (and other) government budgets.\nTransportation securities, another component of the\nindustrial sector, are cyclical and have occasional sharp\nprice movements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and insurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market\nconditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or\nprice or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid investments and may\nbe subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the\nFund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling\nsuch investments, may be unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or sector.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from\nyear to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective November 16, 2017, the Fund's benchmark index\nchanged from the Russell 2000 Index to the SSGA Small Cap Index. Effective January 24, 2020, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the SSGA Small Cap Index to the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. Each benchmark index\nchange was 66\n\nconsistent with a change in the Fund's principal investment strategy to track the performance of a new\nindex. Performance of the Fund prior to January 24, 2020 is therefore based on the Fund's investment\nstrategy to track the applicable prior indexes and may have been different had the Fund tracked the current\nindex.\n                                                                                 \n                                                   OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                              16.02%   11.54%     8.01%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions              15.43%   11.06%     7.44%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of  9.66%    9.07%      6.27%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                    \n  S&P SmallCap 600 Index/SSGA Small Cap                                          \n  Index/Russell 2000 Index1(reflects no deduction  16.05%   11.61%     8.01%     \n  forfees, expenses or taxes)                                                    \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,   26.29%   15.69%     12.03%    \n  expenses or taxes)                                                             \n                                                                                 \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index for the period January 24, 2020 to December 31,\n2022, the SSGA Small Cap Index for the period from November 16, 2017 to January 23, 2020, and the Russell\n2000 Index for periods prior to November 16, 2017. Portfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as\nthe investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio Managers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-\nto-day management of the Fund are Karl Schneider and Teddy Wong. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the\nAdviser in 1997. Teddy Wong is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the Adviser in 2001. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national\nsecurities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k)\nplan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be\ntaxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services\nrelated to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another\ninvestment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n67\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio S&P Sector Neutral Dividend ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P Sector Neutral Dividend ETF  \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results    \n  that,before fees and expenses, correspond           \n  generally to the total return performance of an     \n  index that tracks theperformance of publicly        \n  traded issuers that have historically followed a    \n  policy of increasing or maintainingdividend         \n  payments and mirrors the sector weights of the      \n  broad exchange-traded U.S. equity                   \n  securitiesuniverse.                                 \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.05%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.05%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $5         $16     $28      $64  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities\n(or \u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not\nreflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. From the\nFund's commencement of operations on September 12, 2023 to the most recent fiscal year end, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate was 23 % of the average value of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P Sector-Neutral High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not required to purchase\nall of the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the securities in\nthe Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset\nof securities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser to\nbe in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the\nIndex. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are not\nincluded in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments\n(including money market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track the\nIndex,\n\n68\n\nthe Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the Index and in managing\ncash flows. The Index is designed to measure the performance of companies in the S&P Composite 1500 \u00ae Index\n(the \u201cParent Index\u201d) that have followed a policy of increasing or maintaining dividends every year for at\nleast seven consecutive years while maintaining sector weights that correspond to the Parent Index. The\nParent Index is designed to measure the performance of the broad exchange-traded U.S. equity securities\nuniverse. To be eligible for inclusion in the Index, a company must also have (i) a float-adjusted market\ncapitalization of at least $2 billion ($1.5 billion for current Index constituents) and (ii) a three-month\nmedian daily value traded of at least $5 million ($4 million for current Index constituents). After\ndetermining the eligible companies, the Index Provider (defined below) calculates the median annual dividend\nyield of the eligible companies within each Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sector to obtain\na sector median dividend yield. Eligible companies with dividend yields above their corresponding sector\nmedian dividend yield will be selected for inclusion in the Index. At each rebalance, companies within the\nIndex are weighted by float-adjusted market capitalization within their corresponding sector. Each sector is\nthen weighted to mirror the corresponding sector weight within the Parent Index. The Index is reconstituted\nannually after the closing of the last business day of January and rebalanced quarterly after the closing of\nthe last business day of January, April, July and October. If between annual reviews the Index Provider\ndetermines, based on publicly available information, that an Index constituent has omitted a scheduled\ndividend payment, announced it will cease paying dividends for an undetermined period, or announced a\nreduced dividend amount and will no longer qualify for the Index at the subsequent reconstitution, the Index\nconstituent will be removed from the Index effective prior to the open of the first business day of the\nfollowing month. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the Index comprised companies in the\ntechnology sector, although this may change from time to time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised 272\nstocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all investments, there are certain risks of investing in\nthe Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment\nin the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes\nin the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject to\nthe risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies and\nmarkets. Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural\ndisasters, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company. In\naddition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended\nperiods of time. Dividend Paying Securities Risk: Securities that pay dividends, as a group, can fall out of\nfavor with the market, causing such companies to underperform companies that do not pay dividends. In\naddition, changes in the dividend policies of the companies held by the Fund or the capital resources\navailable for such company's dividend payments may adversely affect the Fund. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and\nsold in the secondary market at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there may be times when the market price of the\nshares is more than the net asset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market volatility or periods of steep market declines.\n\n69\n\nFutures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that calls for the purchase or sale of\na specific asset at a specific price at a specific future time, or cash settlement of the terms of the\ncontract. Transactions in futures contracts can create investment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures contract transaction will result in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may not be able to close out the futures contract at a favorable\ntime or price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange will exist for any\nparticular futures contract. In the event no such market exists, it might not be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and the Fund will be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is also a\nrisk of imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a futures contract may be unable or unwilling to make\ntimely settlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track\nthe performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of\nthe Index or of the actual securities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The structure and\ncomposition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently,\nthe performance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to the component securities of\nthe Index and the Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect\nchanges in the securities included in the Index. The Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. In addition, the Fund may not be fully invested at\ntimes, generally as a result of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to\nmeet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities not included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that of the Index. Limited Track Record Risk: The Fund has a\nlimited track record and there is no assurance that the Fund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading volume, which could lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing\nexchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause elevated transaction costs for the Fund and\nnegative tax consequences for its shareholders. Non-Diversification Risk: To the extent the Fund becomes\n\u201cnon-diversified,\u201d the Fund may hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many other funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested in a larger number of\nissuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of shares of more diversified funds.\nThe Fund may become non-diversified for periods of time solely as a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component securities). Technology Sector Risk: Market or economic\nfactors impacting technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technological advances could have\na major effect on the value of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product\ncycles, rapid product obsolescence, government regulation and competition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from foreign competitors with lower production costs. Stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Technology companies are heavily\ndependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely affect\nprofitability. Additionally, companies in the technology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel.\n\n70\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time to time. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential for volatility and the risk that events negatively affecting\nsuch sectors or industries could reduce returns, potentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly. Fund Performance The Fund has not yet completed a full calendar year of\noperations and therefore does not report its performance history. Once the Fund has completed a full\ncalendar year of operations, a bar chart and table will be included that will provide some indication of the\nrisks of investing in the Fund by showing the variability of the Fund's returns based on net assets and\ncomparing the Fund's performance to the Index.

Portfolio\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio Managers The\nprofessionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Emiliano Rabinovich, Juan\nAcevedo and Ted Janowsky. Emiliano Rabinovich, CFA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 2006. Juan Acevedo is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2000. Ted Janowsky, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the Adviser in 2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the \u201cExchange\u201d), other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through\nyour broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k)\nplan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be\ntaxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services\nrelated to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another\ninvestment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n71\n\nSPDR \u00ae Russell 1000 \u00ae Low Volatility Focus ETF\n                                                    \n  Investment Objective                              \n  The SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF    \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results  \n  that,before fees and expenses, correspond         \n  generally to the total return performance of the  \n  Russell 1000 LowVolatility Focused Factor Index.  \n                                                    \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.20%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.20%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 34 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the Russell\n1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index (including common stock,\npreferred stock, depositary receipts and shares of other\ninvestment companies). The Fund may also invest in cash and\ncash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n72\n\nThe Index is designed to reflect the performance of a\nsegment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities\ndemonstrating a combination of core factors (high value,\nhigh quality, and low size characteristics), with a focus\nfactor comprising low volatility characteristics (the\n\u201cFactor Characteristics\u201d). To construct the Index, Frank\nRussell Company (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d) utilizes a rules-\nbased multi-factor scoring process that seeks to increase\nexposure (or \u201ctilt\u201d) to companies in the Russell 1000 Index\ndemonstrating the Factor Characteristics. The Russell 1000\nIndex is a market-capitalization index that measures the\nperformance of the large-cap segment of the U.S. equity\nuniverse. Within the multi-factor scoring process, a\nspecific focus is applied towards a company's volatility\nfactor. Volatility is a statistical measurement of the\nmagnitude of movements in a stock's price over time. Each\nstock's factor scores are multiplied by the stock's free\nfloat market cap weight in the Russell 1000 Index to\ndetermine each constituent's weight in the multi-factor\nIndex. Companies in the Russell 1000 Index are excluded\nfrom the Index if they do not meet a minimum weight in the\nIndex. A company's volatility factor score is based on the\nstandard deviation of weekly total returns to a company's\nstock price over the trailing five years ending on the last\nbusiness day of the month prior to the Index rebalancing\nmonth. A company's value factor score is based on cash flow\nyield, earnings yield, and country relative sales to price\nratio, calculated based on the company's total market\ncapitalization and information reported in the company's\nmost recent annual financial statement as of the last\nbusiness day of the month prior to the Index rebalancing\nmonth. A company's quality factor score is based on return\non assets, change in asset turnover, accruals, and\nleverage, calculated based on information reported in the\ncompany's most recent annual financial statement as of the\nlast business day of the month prior to the Index\nrebalancing month. A company's size factor score is based\non total market capitalization as of the last business day\nof the month prior to the Index rebalancing month. The\nweight of each individual stock in the Index is capped at\n2000% of the stock's weight in the Russell 1000 Index, and\nany weight exceeding this limit will be redistributed to\nall stocks below the limit in proportion to their\ncombination of market capitalization and factor scoring.\nThe weight of each industry in the Index is capped at 120%\nof the industry's weight in the Russell 1000 Index plus an\nadditional 5%, and any weight exceeding this limit is\nredistributed to all other industries below the limit in\nproportion to their combination of market capitalization\nand factor scoring. The weight of each industry in the\nIndex must be at least 80% of the industry's weight in the\nRussell 1000 Index less 5%. The weights of any industries\nbelow this minimum will be increased to the minimum by\nredistributing the weights of industries above the minimum\nin proportion to their combination of market capitalization\nand factor scoring. The Index is rebalanced annually in\nJune. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nFund comprised companies in the industrial and consumer\ndiscretionary sectors, although this may change from time\nto time. As of July 31, 2024 there were approximately 429\nsecurities in the Index. The Index is sponsored by the\nIndex Provider, which is not affiliated with the Fund or\nthe Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition\nof the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Low Volatility Risk: Although subject to the risks of\ncommon stocks, low volatility stocks are seen as having a\nlower risk profile than the overall markets. However, a\nportfolio comprised of low volatility stocks may not\nproduce investment exposure that has lower variability to\nchanges in such stocks' price levels. Low volatility stocks\nare likely to underperform the broader market during\nperiods of rapidly rising stock prices.\n\n73\n\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector Risk: The success of consumer product\nmanufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the\nperformance of the overall global economy, interest rates,\ncompetition and consumer confidence. Success depends\nheavily on disposable household income and consumer\nspending. Also, companies in the consumer discretionary\nsector may be subject to severe competition, which may have\nan adverse impact on their respective profitability.\nChanges in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect\nthe demand for, and success of, consumer products and\nservices in the marketplace. Futures Contract Risk: A\nfutures contract is a standardized agreement that calls for\nthe purchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific\nprice at a specific future time, or cash settlement of the\nterms of the contract. Transactions in futures contracts\ncan create investment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures contract\ntransaction will result in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable time or\nprice. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market\non an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts\n\n74\n\nto control the U.S. (and other) government budgets.\nTransportation securities, another component of the\nindustrial sector, are cyclical and have occasional sharp\nprice movements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and insurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization Securities Risk: Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail\nthe returns on investments in securities of smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Larger companies may be unable to\nrespond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in business, product,\nfinancial, or other market conditions. Larger companies may\nnot be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies. Quality Risk: A \u201cquality\u201d style of investing\nemphasizes companies with high returns on equity, stable\nearnings per share growth, and low financial leverage. This\nstyle of investing is subject to the risk that the past\nperformance of these companies does not continue or that\nthe returns on \u201cquality\u201d equity securities are less than\nreturns on other styles of investing or the overall stock\nmarket. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Value Stock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style of\ninvesting is subject to the risk that the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity securities are less than returns on other\nstyles of investing or the overall stock market. Value\nstocks present the risk that they may decline in price or\nnever reach their expected full market value because the\nmarket fails to recognize a stock's intrinsic worth. Fund\nPerformance The following bar chart and table provide an\nindication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to year and by\nshowing how the Fund's average annual returns for certain\ntime periods compare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities index.

The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. 75\n                                                                                          \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  SinceInception  \n  12/2/2015                                                                               \n  Return Before Taxes                                 13.30%   13.30%     11.37%          \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 12.76%   12.75%     10.48%          \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     8.17%    10.55%     8.94%           \n  Fund Shares                                                                             \n  Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index    13.49%   13.53%     11.61%          \n  (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses ortaxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,      26.29%   15.69%     12.87%          \n  expenses or taxes)                                                                      \n                                                                                          \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Emiliano Rabinovich. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head\nof the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Emiliano Rabinovich,\nCFA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 2006. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of\nFund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit\nor delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a\ntax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made\nfrom such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n76\n\nSPDR \u00ae Russell 1000 \u00ae Momentum Focus ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Russell 1000 Momentum Focus ETF (the      \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the total return performance of the Russell 1000   \n  MomentumFocused Factor Index.                      \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.20%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.20%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 50 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the Russell\n1000 Momentum Focused Factor Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index (including common stock,\npreferred stock, depositary receipts and shares of other\ninvestment companies). The Fund may also invest in cash and\ncash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n77\n\nThe Index is designed to reflect the performance of a\nsegment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities\ndemonstrating a combination of core factors (high value,\nhigh quality, and low size characteristics), with a focus\nfactor comprising high momentum characteristics (the\n\u201cFactor Characteristics\u201d). To construct the Index, Frank\nRussell Company (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d) utilizes a rules-\nbased multi-factor scoring process that seeks to increase\nexposure (or \u201ctilt\u201d) to companies in the Russell 1000 Index\ndemonstrating the Factor Characteristics. The Russell 1000\nIndex is a market-capitalization index that measures the\nperformance of the large-cap segment of the U.S. equity\nuniverse. Within the multi-factor scoring process, a\nspecific focus is applied towards a company's momentum\nfactor. Companies with higher momentum are those whose\nsecurities have had higher recent price performance\ncompared to other securities. Each stock's factor scores\nare multiplied by the stock's free float market cap weight\nin the Russell 1000 Index to determine each constituent's\nweight in the multi-factor Index. Companies in the Russell\n1000 Index are excluded from the Index if they do not meet\na minimum weight in the Index. A company's momentum factor\nscore is based on historical total return over the 11\nmonths ending on the last business day of the month prior\nto the Index rebalancing month. A company's value factor\nscore is based on cash flow yield, earnings yield, and\ncountry relative sales to price ratio, calculated based on\nthe company's total market capitalization and information\nreported in the company's most recent annual financial\nstatement as of the last business day of the month prior to\nthe Index rebalancing month. A company's quality factor\nscore is based on return on assets, change in asset\nturnover, accruals, and leverage, calculated based on\ninformation reported in the company's most recent annual\nfinancial statement as of the last business day of the\nmonth prior to the Index rebalancing month. A company's\nsize factor score is based on total market capitalization\nas of the last business day of the month prior to the Index\nrebalancing month. The weight of each individual stock in\nthe Index is capped at 2000% of the stock's weight in the\nRussell 1000 Index, and any weight exceeding this limit\nwill be redistributed to all stocks below the limit in\nproportion to their combination of market capitalization\nand factor scoring. The weight of each industry in the\nIndex is capped at 120% of the industry's weight in the\nRussell 1000 Index plus an additional 5%, and any weight\nexceeding this limit is redistributed to all other\nindustries below the limit in proportion to their\ncombination of market capitalization and factor scoring.\nThe weight of each industry in the Index must be at least\n80% of the industry's weight in the Russell 1000 Index less\n5%. The weights of any industries below this minimum will\nbe increased to the minimum by redistributing the weights\nof industries above the minimum in proportion to their\ncombination of market capitalization and factor scoring.\nThe Index is rebalanced semi-annually in June and December.\nAs of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in the financial sector, although this\nmay change from time to time. As of July 31, 2024 there\nwere approximately 908 securities in the Index. The Index\nis sponsored by the Index Provider, which is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Momentum Risk: The Fund employs a \u201cmomentum\u201d style of\ninvesting that emphasizes investing in securities that have\nhad higher recent price performance compared to other\nsecurities. This style of investing is subject to the risk\nthat these securities may be more volatile than a broad\ncross-section of securities or that the returns on\nsecurities that have previously exhibited price momentum\nare less than returns on other styles of investing or the\noverall stock market. Momentum can turn quickly and cause\nsignificant variation from other types of investments.\n\n78\n\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation, which may limit both the\namounts and types of loans and other financial commitments\nthey can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge,\nthe scope of their activities, the prices they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an\nadverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money markets\ngenerally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets. Certain events in the financial\nsector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in\nthe financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause\ncertain financial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n79\n\nLarge-Capitalization Securities Risk: Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail\nthe returns on investments in securities of smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Larger companies may be unable to\nrespond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in business, product,\nfinancial, or other market conditions. Larger companies may\nnot be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies. Quality Risk: A \u201cquality\u201d style of investing\nemphasizes companies with high returns on equity, stable\nearnings per share growth, and low financial leverage. This\nstyle of investing is subject to the risk that the past\nperformance of these companies does not continue or that\nthe returns on \u201cquality\u201d equity securities are less than\nreturns on other styles of investing or the overall stock\nmarket. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Value Stock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style of\ninvesting is subject to the risk that the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity securities are less than returns on other\nstyles of investing or the overall stock market. Value\nstocks present the risk that they may decline in price or\nnever reach their expected full market value because the\nmarket fails to recognize a stock's intrinsic worth. Fund\nPerformance The following bar chart and table provide an\nindication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to year and by\nshowing how the Fund's average annual returns for certain\ntime periods compare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Emiliano Rabinovich. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head\nof the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Emiliano Rabinovich,\nCFA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 2006. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of\nFund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit\nor delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a\ntax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made\nfrom such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n81\n\nSPDR \u00ae Russell 1000 \u00ae Yield Focus ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Russell 1000 Yield Focus ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)  \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before    \n  feesand expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  total return performance of the Russell 1000 Yield  \n  FocusedFactor Index.                                \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.20%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.20%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 35 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the Russell\n1000 Yield Focused Factor Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index (including common stock,\npreferred stock, depositary receipts and shares of other\ninvestment companies). The Fund may also invest in cash and\ncash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n82\n\nThe Index is designed to reflect the performance of a\nsegment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities\ndemonstrating a combination of core factors (high value,\nhigh quality, and low size characteristics), with a focus\nfactor comprising high yield characteristics (the \u201cFactor\nCharacteristics\u201d). To construct the Index, Frank Russell\nCompany (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d) utilizes a rules-based\nmulti-factor scoring process that seeks to increase\nexposure (or \u201ctilt\u201d) to companies in the Russell 1000 Index\ndemonstrating the Factor Characteristics. The Russell 1000\nIndex is a market-capitalization index that measures the\nperformance of the large-cap segment of the U.S. equity\nuniverse. Within the multi-factor scoring process, a\nspecific focus is applied towards a company's yield factor.\nCompanies with higher yield are those whose securities have\npaid higher dividends compared to other securities. Each\nstock's factor scores are multiplied by the stock's free\nfloat market cap weight in the Russell 1000 Index to\ndetermine each constituent's weight in the multi-factor\nIndex. Companies in the Russell 1000 Index are excluded\nfrom the Index if they do not meet a minimum weight in the\nIndex. A company's yield factor score is based on 12-month\ntrailing dividend yield as of the last business day of the\nmonth prior to the Index rebalancing month. A company's\nvalue factor score is based on cash flow yield, earnings\nyield, and country relative sales to price ratio,\ncalculated based on the company's total market\ncapitalization and information reported in the company's\nmost recent annual financial statement as of the last\nbusiness day of the month prior to the Index rebalancing\nmonth. A company's quality factor score is based on return\non assets, change in asset turnover, accruals, and\nleverage, calculated based on information reported in the\ncompany's most recent annual financial statement as of the\nlast business day of the month prior to the Index\nrebalancing month. A company's size factor score is based\non the total market capitalization as of the last business\nday of the month prior to the Index rebalancing month. The\nweight of each individual stock in the Index is capped at\n2000% of the stock's weight in the Russell 1000 Index, and\nany weight exceeding this limit will be redistributed to\nall stocks below the limit in proportion to their\ncombination of market capitalization and factor scoring.\nThe weight of each industry in the Index is capped at 120%\nof the industry's weight in the Russell 1000 Index plus an\nadditional 5%, and any weight exceeding this limit is\nredistributed to all other industries below the limit in\nproportion to their combination of market capitalization\nand factor scoring. The weight of each industry in the\nIndex must be at least 80% of the industry's weight in the\nRussell 1000 Index less 5%. The weights of any industries\nbelow this minimum will be increased to the minimum by\nredistributing the weights of industries above the minimum\nin proportion to their combination of market capitalization\nand factor scoring. The Index is rebalanced annually in\nJune. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nFund comprised companies in the consumer discretionary\nsector, although this may change from time to time. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, there were approximately 289 securities in\nthe Index. The Index is sponsored by the Index Provider,\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nDividend Paying Securities Risk: Securities that pay\ndividends, as a group, can fall out of favor with the\nmarket, causing such companies to underperform companies\nthat do not pay dividends. In addition, changes in the\ndividend policies of the companies held by the Fund or the\ncapital resources available for such company's dividend\npayments may adversely affect the Fund.\n\n83\n\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector Risk: The success of consumer product\nmanufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the\nperformance of the overall global economy, interest rates,\ncompetition and consumer confidence. Success depends\nheavily on disposable household income and consumer\nspending. Also, companies in the consumer discretionary\nsector may be subject to severe competition, which may have\nan adverse impact on their respective profitability.\nChanges in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect\nthe demand for, and success of, consumer products and\nservices in the marketplace. Futures Contract Risk: A\nfutures contract is a standardized agreement that calls for\nthe purchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific\nprice at a specific future time, or cash settlement of the\nterms of the contract. Transactions in futures contracts\ncan create investment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures contract\ntransaction will result in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable time or\nprice. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market\non an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Large-Capitalization Securities\nRisk: Returns on investments in securities of large\ncompanies could trail the returns on investments in\nsecurities of smaller and mid-sized companies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable to respond as quickly as smaller\nand mid-sized companies to competitive challenges or to\nchanges in business, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high rates that may be achieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and mid-sized companies. Quality Risk: A\n\u201cquality\u201d style of investing emphasizes companies with high\nreturns on equity, stable earnings per share growth, and\nlow financial leverage. This style of investing is subject\nto the risk that the past performance of these companies\ndoes not continue or that the returns on \u201cquality\u201d equity\nsecurities are less than returns on other styles of\ninvesting or the overall stock market.\n\n84\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Value Stock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style of\ninvesting is subject to the risk that the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity securities are less than returns on other\nstyles of investing or the overall stock market. Value\nstocks present the risk that they may decline in price or\nnever reach their expected full market value because the\nmarket fails to recognize a stock's intrinsic worth.

Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. John Law, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2016.\n\n85\n\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n86\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF\n                                                    \n  Investment Objective                              \n  The SPDR S&P 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)  \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before  \n  feesand expenses, correspond generally to the     \n  total return performance of an index that tracks  \n  the performanceof U.S. equity securities          \n  exhibiting price momentum.                        \n                                                    \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.12%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.12%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 56 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\n1500 Positive Momentum Tilt Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n87\n\nThe Index applies an alternative weighting methodology to\nthe S&P Composite 1500 Index so that stocks with relatively\nstrong momentum are overweight relative to the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index and stocks with relatively weak\nmomentum are underweight. The S&P Composite 1500 Index, one\nof the leading indices of the U.S. equity market, is a\ncapitalization-weighted combination of the large-cap S&P\n500 Index, the S&P MidCap 400 Index, and the S&P SmallCap\n600 Index. A \u201cmomentum\u201d style of investing emphasizes\ninvesting in securities that have had higher recent price\nperformance compared to other securities. In constructing\nthe Index, the Index Provider (as defined below) estimates\nthe momentum of each stock in the S&P Composite 1500 Index\nbased on its 11-month total return ending on the\nrebalancing reference date and ranks all 1,500 Index\nconstituents in order of momentum. S&P then forms 20 sub-\nportfolios of approximately equal market capitalization,\ngrouped by momentum. S&P determines each sub-portfolio\nallocation so that a sub-portfolio with relatively high\nmomentum will have a higher allocation than a sub-portfolio\nwith relatively low momentum. The weight of each stock in\nthe Index is proportional to its market capitalization and\nto its sub-portfolio allocation. The Index is rebalanced\nquarterly, effective after the close on the third Friday of\nJanuary, April, July, and October. As of August 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised companies in the\ntechnology sector, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, there were approximately 1,502\nsecurities in the Index. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nMomentum Risk: The Fund employs a \u201cmomentum\u201d style of\ninvesting that emphasizes investing in securities that have\nhad higher recent price performance compared to other\nsecurities. This style of investing is subject to the risk\nthat these securities may be more volatile than a broad\ncross-section of securities or that the returns on\nsecurities that have previously exhibited price momentum\nare less than returns on other styles of investing or the\noverall stock market. Momentum can turn quickly and cause\nsignificant variation from other types of investments.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures\n\n88\n\ncontract and movements in the price of the underlying\nassets. The counterparty to a futures contract may be\nunable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments,\nreturn the Fund's margin, or otherwise honor its\nobligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with an indexing investment strategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index\nof securities, regardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual securities\ncomprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed\nfund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active\ninvestment strategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Index and, consequently, the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur from time to time and may\nnot be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact\non the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent\ncircumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the Index\nmay include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period\nof time, securities of companies that do not align with the\nIndex's objective and/or criteria. When there are changes\nmade to the component securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of\nportfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent\nthe Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular security held\nby the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested\nin a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may\nbe more volatile than the values of shares of more\ndiversified funds. The Fund may become diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of tracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Technology Sector Risk: Market or economic\nfactors impacting technology companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technological advances could have a major\neffect on the value of the Fund's investments. The value of\nstocks of technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, including competition\nfrom foreign competitors with lower production costs.\nStocks of technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are heavily dependent\non patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.12%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.12%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 13 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\n1500 Low Valuation Tilt Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n92\n\nThe Index applies an alternative weighting methodology to\nthe S&P Composite 1500 Index so that stocks with relatively\nlow valuations ( i.e. , relatively \u201ccheap\u201d) are overweight\nrelative to the S&P Composite 1500 Index and stocks with\nrelatively high valuations ( i.e. , relatively \u201crich\u201d) are\nunderweight. The S&P Composite 1500 Index, one of the\nleading indices of the U.S. equity market, is a\ncapitalization-weighted combination of the large-cap S&P\n500 Index, the S&P MidCap 400 Index, and the S&P SmallCap\n600 Index. In constructing the Index, the Index Provider\n(as defined below) estimates the valuation of each stock in\nthe S&P Composite 1500 Index based on the ratio of its\nprice to its reported book value and last 12 months level\nof earnings, cash flow, sales, and dividends. S&P weights\nthis data from the last five calendar years to create a\ncomposite valuation measure, and ranks all 1,500 index\nconstituents in order of composite valuation. S&P then\nforms 20 sub-portfolios of approximately equal market\ncapitalization, grouped by composite valuations. S&P\nderives a sub-portfolio allocation factor using each sub-\nportfolio's composite valuation, so that a sub-portfolio\nwith relatively low valuation will have a higher allocation\nfactor than a sub-portfolio with relatively high valuation.\nThe weight of each stock in the Index is proportionate to\nits market capitalization and to its sub-portfolio\nallocation factor. The Index is rebalanced annually after\nthe close of business on the third Friday of April. As of\nAugust 31, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in the financial sector, although this\nmay change from time to time. As of July 31, 2024, there\nwere approximately 1,481 securities in the Index. The Index\nis sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Value Stock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style of investing is\nsubject to the risk that the returns on \u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less than returns on other styles of\ninvesting or the overall stock market. Value stocks present\nthe risk that they may decline in price or never reach\ntheir expected full market value because the market fails\nto recognize a stock's intrinsic worth. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Financial Sector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which may limit both the amounts and types of\nloans and other financial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of\nthe credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in\na broad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial\n\n93\n\nservices companies may experience a dramatic decline in\nvalue when such companies experience substantial declines\nin the valuations of their assets, take action to raise\ncapital (such as the issuance of debt or equity\nsecurities), or cease operations. Credit losses resulting\nfrom financial difficulties of borrowers and financial\nlosses associated with investment activities can negatively\nimpact the sector. Insurance companies may be subject to\nsevere price competition. Adverse economic, business or\npolitical developments could adversely affect financial\ninstitutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending\nor investing activities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate. Futures Contract Risk: A futures\ncontract is a standardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific price at\na specific future time, or cash settlement of the terms of\nthe contract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets within one\nor more economic sectors or industries, which may change\nfrom time to time. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential for\nvolatility and the risk that events negatively affecting\nsuch sectors or industries could reduce returns,\npotentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly.\n\n94\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The Index is market\ncapitalization weighted, subject to capping requirements to\ncomply with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(the \u201cCode\u201d). The Index is reconstituted annually after the\nclose of business on the third Friday of December and\nrebalances quarterly after the close of business on the\nthird Friday of March, June, September and December. As of\nAugust 31, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in the industrial and consumer\ndiscretionary sectors, although this may change from time\nto time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised 252\nstocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Mid-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities of\nmid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Growth Stock Risk: The prices of growth stocks\nmay be based largely on expectations of future earnings,\nand their prices can decline rapidly and significantly in\nreaction to negative news. Growth stocks may underperform\nvalue stocks and stocks in other broad style categories\n(and the stock market as a whole) over any period of time\nand may shift in and out of favor with investors generally,\nsometimes rapidly, depending on changes in market,\neconomic, and other factors. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times\n\n98\n\nwhen the market price of the shares is more than the net\nasset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is heightened in\ntimes of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk: The success\nof consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied\nclosely to the performance of the overall global economy,\ninterest rates, competition and consumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily on disposable household income and\nconsumer spending. Also, companies in the consumer\ndiscretionary sector may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on their respective\nprofitability. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes\ncan also affect the demand for, and success of, consumer\nproducts and services in the marketplace. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs.\n\n99\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from\nyear to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider, Juan Acevedo and Michael Finocchi.\n\n100\n\nKarl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group\nin the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Juan Acevedo is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the Adviser in 2000. Michael Finocchi is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a\ntax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made\nfrom such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n101\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF\n                                                    \n  Investment Objective                              \n  The SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)   \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before  \n  feesand expenses, correspond generally to the     \n  total return performance of an index that tracks  \n  the performanceof medium capitalization exchange  \n  traded U.S. equity securities exhibiting\u201cvalue\u201d   \n  characteristics.                                  \n                                                    \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.15%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 41 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nMidCap 400 Value Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n102\n\nThe Index measures the performance of the mid-\ncapitalization value segment of the U.S. equity market. The\nIndex consists of those stocks in the S&P MidCap 400 Index\nexhibiting the strongest value characteristics based on:\n(i) book value to price ratio; (ii) earnings to price\nratio; and (iii) sales to price ratio. The selection\nuniverse for the S&P MidCap 400 Index includes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe\nEDGA, or Cboe EDGX with market capitalizations between $6.7\nbillion and $18 billion at the time of inclusion. This\ncapitalization range may be revised by the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at any time. To be included in the\nIndex, a security (or issuer of a security, as applicable)\nshould (i) have an annual dollar value traded to float\nadjusted market capitalization ratio of 0.75 or greater at\nthe time of addition to the S&P Composite 1500 Index (the\nIndex's parent index); (ii) trade a minimum of 250,000\nshares in each of the six months leading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii) have a public float of at least 10%;\nand (iv) have positive as-reported earnings over the most\nrecent four consecutive quarters (measured using the sum of\nearnings over those quarters) and for the most recent\nquarter. The Index is market capitalization weighted,\nsubject to capping requirements to comply with the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The Index is\nreconstituted annually after the close of business on the\nthird Friday of December and rebalances quarterly after the\nclose of business on the third Friday of March, June,\nSeptember and December. As of August 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised companies in the\nfinancial sector, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised 292 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or\nthe Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition\nof the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Mid-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities of\nmid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Value Stock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style of investing is\nsubject to the risk that the returns on \u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less than returns on other styles of\ninvesting or the overall stock market. Value stocks present\nthe risk that they may decline in price or never reach\ntheir expected full market value because the market fails\nto recognize a stock's intrinsic worth. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines.\n\n103\n\nFinancial Sector Risk: Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation, which may\nlimit both the amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the interest rates and\nfees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the\nprices they can charge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the\navailability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change or due to\nincreased competition. In addition, deterioration of the\ncredit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets within one\nor more economic sectors or industries, which may change\nfrom time to time. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential for\nvolatility and the risk that events negatively affecting\nsuch sectors or industries could reduce returns,\npotentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly.\n\n104\n\nValuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to\nvalue a portfolio holding when market quotations are not\nreadily available. The value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from what would be\nproduced using a different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are\nvalued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the\nnext than if market quotations were used. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out\na portfolio position for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a\nloss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at\na discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider, Juan Acevedo and Raymond Donofrio. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser\nand Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Juan Acevedo\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He\njoined the Adviser in 2000.\n\n105\n\nRaymond Donofrio is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity\nBeta Group. He joined the Adviser in 2008. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange\nfor the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund\nShares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market\nprices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's\ndistributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n106\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P 500 \u00ae Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF\n                                                    \n  Investment Objective                              \n  The SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF    \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results  \n  that,before fees and expenses, correspond         \n  generally to the total return performance of the  \n  S&P 500 Fossil FuelReserves Free Index.           \n                                                    \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.20%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.20%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 2 % of the average value\nof its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\nIn seeking to track the performance of the S&P 500 Fossil\nFuel Reserves Free Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex (including common stock, preferred stock, depositary\nreceipts and shares of other investment companies). The\nFund may also invest in cash and cash equivalents or money\nmarket instruments (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in\nan industry or group of industries, but only to the extent\nthat the Index concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. Futures contracts (a type of\nderivative instrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to the Index and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n107\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of\ncompanies in the S&P 500 Index that are \u201cfossil fuel\nreserves free,\u201d as determined by S&P Trucost Limited\nthrough its review of publicly available information, such\nas annual reports and other company publications. For\npurposes of the composition of the Index, fossil fuel\nreserves are defined as proved and probable (i) thermal\ncoal reserves, (ii) other non-metallurgical coal reserves\n(e.g., coal for chemical biproducts, coal briquettes,\nresidential use, liquid fuel, cement production, paper\nmanufacturing, pharmaceutical, alumina refineries,\nferrochrome, anthracite) (iii) conventional or\nunconventional oil reserves (e.g., natural gas liquids, oil\nsands, condensates and liquid petroleum gas), (iv) natural\ngas reserves, (v) shale gas reserves, and (vi) oil and gas\nreserves that have not been disclosed transparently as\nspecific types of oil or gas, or are disclosed as one\naggregate quantity of oil and gas reserves combined. The\nIndex is a subset of the S&P 500 Index (the \u201cUnderlying\nIndex\u201d), which serves as the initial universe of eligible\nsecurities for the Index. The Underlying Index focuses on\nthe large capitalization U.S. equity market, including\ncommon stock and real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d).\nThe selection universe for the S&P 500 Index includes all\nU.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe\nEDGA, or Cboe EDGX with unadjusted market capitalizations\nof at least $18 billion and float-adjusted market\ncapitalizations of at least $9 billion at the time of\ninclusion. The minimum required capitalization may be\nrevised by the Index Provider (as defined below) at any\ntime. In constructing the Index, the initial universe is\nscreened in an effort to exclude companies with any\nownership of proved or probable fossil fuel reserves,\nincluding for third-party and in-house power generation.\nThe Index is weighted by float-adjusted market\ncapitalization. The Index is rebalanced quarterly after the\nclose of business on the third Friday of March, June,\nSeptember, and December. The rebalancing reference dates\nare after the close of the third Friday of February, May,\nAugust, and November, respectively. New additions to the\nUnderlying Index are reviewed for inclusion in the Index\neach quarter, provided they have been added to the\nUnderlying Index by the Index rebalancing reference dates.\nFossil fuel reserve ownership information is updated as\npart of each quarterly rebalancing. As of August 31, 2024,\na significant portion of the Fund comprised companies in\nthe technology sector, although this may change from time\nto time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised 488\nstocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Fossil Fuel Reserves Free Ownership Risk: The returns\non a portfolio of securities that seeks to exclude\ncompanies that own fossil fuel reserves may trail the\nreturns on a portfolio of securities that includes such\ncompanies. Investing in a portfolio of securities of\ncompanies that do not own fossil fuel reserves may affect\nthe Fund's exposure to certain types of investments and may\nimpact the Fund's relative investment performance depending\non whether such investments are in or out of favor in the\nmarket. Large-Capitalization Securities Risk: Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail\nthe returns on investments in securities of smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Larger companies may be unable to\nrespond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in business,\n\n108\n\nproduct, financial, or other market conditions. Larger\ncompanies may not be able to maintain growth at the high\nrates that may be achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-\nsized companies. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nin the secondary market may differ from the Fund's daily\nnet asset value per share and there may be times when the\nmarket price of the shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset value per\nshare (discount). This risk is heightened in times of\nmarket volatility or periods of steep market declines.\nFutures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Technology Sector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological advances could\nhave a major effect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable\nto rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and internationally,\nincluding competition from foreign competitors with lower\nproduction costs. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology, especially those\nof smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more\nvolatile than the overall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual property\nrights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely\naffect profitability. Additionally, companies in the\ntechnology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for the services of\nqualified personnel.\n\n109\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.

The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                                                                         \n                                                     OneYear  FiveYears  SinceInception  \n  11/30/2015                                                                             \n  Return Before Taxes                                27.35%   15.57%     12.83%          \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                26.95%   15.18%     12.39%          \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of    16.43%   12.50%     10.46%          \n  Fund Shares                                                                            \n  S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free Index (reflects  27.58%   15.83%     13.07%          \n  no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                              \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,     26.29%   15.69%     12.86%          \n  expenses or taxes)                                                                     \n                                                                                         \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and John Law. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. John Law, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2016. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\n\n110\n\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund\nShares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to\naccept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n111\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P 600 Small Cap Growth ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Growth ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)  \n  seeks to provide investment results that,           \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to    \n  the total return performance of an index that       \n  tracks theperformance of small capitalization       \n  exchange traded U.S. equity securities              \n  exhibiting\u201cgrowth\u201dcharacteristics.                  \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.15%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 53 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Growth Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n112\n\nThe Index measures the performance of the small-\ncapitalization growth segment of the U.S. equity market.\nThe Index consists of those stocks in the S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex exhibiting the strongest growth characteristics based\non: (i) sales growth; (ii) changes in earnings over price;\nand (iii) momentum. The selection universe for the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index includes all U.S. common equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe\nBZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX with market\ncapitalizations between $1 billion and $6.7 billion at the\ntime of inclusion. This capitalization range may be revised\nby the Index Provider (as defined below) at any time. To be\nincluded in the Index, a security (or issuer of a security,\nas applicable) should (i) have an annual dollar value\ntraded to float adjusted market capitalization ratio of\n0.75 or greater at the time of addition to the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index (the Index's parent index); (ii) trade\na minimum of 250,000 shares in each of the six months\nleading up to the evaluation date; (iii) have a public\nfloat of at least 10%; and (iv) have positive as-reported\nearnings over the most recent four consecutive quarters\n(measured using the sum of earnings over those quarters)\nand for the most recent quarter. The Index is market\ncapitalization weighted, subject to capping requirements to\ncomply with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(the \u201cCode\u201d). The Index is reconstituted annually after the\nclose of business on the third Friday of December and\nrebalances quarterly after the close of business on the\nthird Friday of March, June, September and December. As of\nAugust 31, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in the technology, industrial and\nconsumer discretionary sectors, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised\n347 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with\nthe Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Small-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities\nof small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and\nmay involve more risk than the securities of larger\ncompanies. These companies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets or financial resources, may lack the competitive\nstrength of larger companies, and may depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition, these companies may have been\nrecently organized and may have little or no track record\nof success. The securities of smaller companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely\nheld securities. Some securities of smaller issuers may be\nilliquid or may be restricted as to resale, and their\nvalues may have significant volatility. The Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any\ntime, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. Returns on investments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger companies. Growth Stock\nRisk: The prices of growth stocks may be based largely on\nexpectations of future earnings, and their prices can\ndecline rapidly and significantly in reaction to negative\nnews. Growth stocks may underperform value stocks and\nstocks in other broad style categories (and the stock\nmarket as a whole) over any period of time and may shift in\nand out of favor with investors generally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on changes in market, economic, and\nother factors. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nin the secondary market may differ from the Fund's daily\nnet asset value per share and there may be times\n\n113\n\nwhen the market price of the shares is more than the net\nasset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is heightened in\ntimes of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk: The success\nof consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied\nclosely to the performance of the overall global economy,\ninterest rates, competition and consumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily on disposable household income and\nconsumer spending. Also, companies in the consumer\ndiscretionary sector may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on their respective\nprofitability. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes\ncan also affect the demand for, and success of, consumer\nproducts and services in the marketplace. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs.\n\n114\n\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market\nconditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or\nprice or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid investments and may\nbe subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the\nFund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling\nsuch investments, may be unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or sector. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or economic factors impacting\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both domestically\nand internationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Technology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time.\n\n115\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and David Chin. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. David Chin is a Vice President\nof the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1999. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as\n\u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a\ndesignated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and\nsold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market\nprices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium)\nor less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n116\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com . Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n117\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P 600 Small Cap Value ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Value ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)  \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before   \n  feesand expenses, correspond generally to the      \n  total return performance of an index that tracks   \n  the performanceof small capitalization exchange    \n  traded U.S. equity securities exhibiting\u201cvalue\u201d    \n  characteristics.                                   \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.15%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 58 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Value Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n118\n\nThe Index measures the performance of the small-\ncapitalization value segment of the U.S. equity market. The\nIndex consists of those stocks in the S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex exhibiting the strongest value characteristics based\non: (i) book value to price ratio; (ii) earnings to price\nratio; and (iii) sales to price ratio. The selection\nuniverse for the S&P SmallCap 600 Index includes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe\nEDGA, or Cboe EDGX with market capitalizations between $1\nbillion and $6.7 billion at the time of inclusion. The\ncapitalization range may be revised by the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at any time. To be included in the\nIndex, a security (or issuer of a security, as applicable)\nshould (i) have an annual dollar value traded to float\nadjusted market capitalization ratio of 0.75 or greater at\nthe time of addition to the S&P Composite 1500 Index (the\nIndex's parent index); (ii) trade a minimum of 250,000\nshares in each of the six months leading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii) have a public float of at least 10%;\nand (iv) have positive as-reported earnings over the most\nrecent four consecutive quarters (measured using the sum of\nearnings over those quarters) and for the most recent\nquarter. The Index is market capitalization weighted,\nsubject to capping requirements to comply with the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The Index is\nreconstituted annually after the close of business on the\nthird Friday of December and rebalances quarterly after the\nclose of business on the third Friday of March, June,\nSeptember and December. As of August 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised companies in the\nfinancial and industrial sectors, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised\n463 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with\nthe Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Small-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities\nof small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and\nmay involve more risk than the securities of larger\ncompanies. These companies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets or financial resources, may lack the competitive\nstrength of larger companies, and may depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition, these companies may have been\nrecently organized and may have little or no track record\nof success. The securities of smaller companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely\nheld securities. Some securities of smaller issuers may be\nilliquid or may be restricted as to resale, and their\nvalues may have significant volatility. The Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any\ntime, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. Returns on investments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger companies. Value Stock\nRisk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style of investing is subject to the risk\nthat the returns on \u201cvalue\u201d equity securities are less than\nreturns on other styles of investing or the overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks present the risk that they may decline\nin price or never reach their expected full market value\nbecause the market fails to recognize a stock's intrinsic\nworth. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times\n\n119\n\nwhen the market price of the shares is more than the net\nasset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is heightened in\ntimes of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Financial Sector Risk: Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive governmental regulation,\nwhich may limit both the amounts and types of loans and\nother financial commitments they can make, the interest\nrates and fees they can charge, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of\nthe credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in\na broad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general\n\n120\n\ncivil liabilities will likewise affect the performance of\nthese companies. Aerospace and defense companies, a\ncomponent of the industrial sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies because companies\ninvolved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign government demand for their products and\nservices. Thus, the financial condition of, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily\ninfluenced by governmental defense spending policies which\nare typically under pressure from efforts to control the\nU.S. (and other) government budgets. Transportation\nsecurities, another component of the industrial sector, are\ncyclical and have occasional sharp price movements which\nmay result from changes in the economy, fuel prices, labor\nagreements and insurance costs. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a\nready market, stressed market conditions, or restrictions\non resale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an advantageous time or price or at all.\nIlliquid investments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be subject to\nwide fluctuations in market value. If the liquidity of the\nFund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares\nbeing less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet\nredemptions on a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Unconstrained\nSector Risk: The Fund may invest a substantial portion of\nits assets within one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to time. Greater\ninvestment focus on one or more sectors or industries\nincreases the potential for volatility and the risk that\nevents negatively affecting such sectors or industries\ncould reduce returns, potentially causing the value of the\nFund's Shares to decrease, perhaps significantly. Valuation\nRisk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on the basis\nof factors other than market quotations. This may occur\nmore often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple methods that can be used to value a\nportfolio holding when market quotations are not readily\navailable. The value established for any portfolio holding\nat a point in time might differ from what would be produced\nusing a different methodology or if it had been priced\nusing market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued\nusing techniques other than market quotations, including\n\u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next\nthan if market quotations were used. In addition, there is\nno assurance that the Fund could sell or close out a\nportfolio position for the value established for it at any\ntime, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a\ndiscount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table\nprovide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund\nby showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns\nfor certain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. David Chin is a Vice President\nof the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1999. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as\n\u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a\ndesignated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and\nsold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market\nprices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium)\nor less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com . Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n122\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)  \n  seeks to provide investment results that,          \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the total return performance of an index derived   \n  from theaerospace and defense segment of a U.S.    \n  total market composite index.                      \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 36 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nAerospace & Defense Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the\nFund is not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n123\n\nThe Index represents the aerospace and defense segment of\nthe S&P Total Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the broad U.S. equity market. The\naerospace & defense segment of the S&P TMI comprises the\nAerospace & Defense sub-industry. The Index is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the S&P Select Industry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d), each designed to measure the\nperformance of a narrow sub-industry or group of sub-\nindustries determined based on the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select\nIndustry Indices is based on the GICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and market cap requirements. Companies in\nthe Select Industry Indices are classified according to\nGICS which determines classifications primarily based on\nrevenues; however, earnings and market perception are also\nconsidered. The Index consists of the S&P TMI constituents\nbelonging to the Aerospace & Defense sub-industry that\nsatisfy the following criteria: (i) have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to $500 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the previous 12 months divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization as of the index\nrebalancing reference date) greater than or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted market capitalization greater than or\nequal to $400 million with a float-adjusted liquidity ratio\n(as defined above) greater than or equal to 150%; and (ii)\nare U.S. based companies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for initial public offerings or spin-offs that\ndo not have 12 months of trading history is annualized. The\nmarket capitalization threshold may be relaxed to ensure\nthat there are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month. The S&P TMI tracks\nall eligible U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 32 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nAerospace and Defense Companies Risk: Aerospace and defense\ncompanies can be significantly affected by government\naerospace and defense regulation and spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry rely to a\nsignificant extent on U.S. (and other) government demand\nfor their products and services. Thus, the financial\ncondition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by governmental\ndefense spending policies which are typically under\npressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nin the secondary market may differ from the Fund's daily\nnet asset value per share and there may be times\n\n124\n\nwhen the market price of the shares is more than the net\nasset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is heightened in\ntimes of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments affecting\nissuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will\nhave a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not done\nso. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the purchase or sale\nof a specific asset at a specific price at a specific\nfuture time, or cash settlement of the terms of the\ncontract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs.\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Keith Richardson. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of\nthe Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Keith Richardson is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 1999. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n126\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n127\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Bank ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to        \n  provide investment results that, before fees and   \n  expenses,correspond generally to the total return  \n  performance of an index that tracks the            \n  performance of publiclytraded national money       \n  centers and leading regional banks.                \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when\ninterest rates change. Credit losses resulting from\nfinancial difficulties of borrowers can negatively impact\nbanking companies. Banks may also be subject to severe\nprice competition. Competition among banking companies is\nhigh and failure to maintain or increase market share may\nresult in lost market value.\n\n129\n\nRegional Bank Risk: Investments in regional banks, which\nmay be small or medium in size, may involve greater risk\nthan investing in larger, more established banks.\nSecurities of regional banks are often less liquid and\nsubject to greater volatility and less trading volume than\nis customarily associated with securities of larger banks.\nA regional bank's financial performance may be dependent\nupon the business environment in certain geographic regions\nof the United States and, as a result, adverse economic or\nemployment developments in such regions may negatively\nimpact such regional bank and, in turn, the Fund. Financial\nInstitutions Risk: Changes in the creditworthiness of\nfinancial institutions (such as banks and broker-dealers)\nmay adversely affect the values of instruments of issuers\nin financial industries. Adverse developments in banking\nand other financial industries may cause the Fund to\nunderperform relative to other funds that invest more\nbroadly across different industries or have a smaller\nexposure to financial institutions. In the Spring of 2023,\nthe shut\u2010down of certain financial institutions raised\neconomic concerns over disruption in the U.S. banking\nsystem. There can be no certainty that the actions taken by\nthe U.S. government to strengthen public confidence in the\nU.S. banking system will be effective in mitigating the\neffects of financial institution failures on the economy\nand restoring public confidence in the U.S. banking system.\nOther adverse developments that affect financial\ninstitutions or the financial services industry generally,\nor concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or\nother similar risks, may reduce liquidity in the market\ngenerally or have other adverse effects on the economy or\nthe Fund. In addition, the Fund may not be able to identify\nall potential solvency or stress concerns with respect to a\nfinancial institution or to transfer assets from one bank\nor financial institution to another in a timely manner in\nthe event such bank or financial institution comes under\nstress or fails. Changes in governmental regulation and\noversight of financial institutions may have an adverse\neffect on the financial condition of a financial\ninstitution. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\n\n130\n\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's\nperformance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's\naverage annual returns for certain time periods compare\nwith the average annual returns of the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based securities index.

After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                                                                 \n                                                   OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                              5.37%    7.25%      5.67%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions              4.49%    6.53%      5.11%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of  3.53%    5.59%      4.44%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                    \n  S&P Banks Select Industry Index (reflects no     5.52%    7.56%      5.99%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                         \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,   26.29%   15.69%     12.03%    \n  expenses or taxes)                                                             \n                                                                                 \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider, Ted Janowsky and Kala O'Donnell. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and\nCo-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Ted Janowsky,\nCFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group.\nHe joined the Adviser in 2005. Kala O'Donnell is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 1995.\n\n131\n\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com . Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n132\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Biotech ETF\n                                                   \n  Investment Objective                             \n  The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to   \n  provide investment results that, before fees     \n  andexpenses, correspond generally to the total   \n  return performance of an index derived from the  \n  biotechnologysegment of a U.S. total market      \n  composite index.                                 \n                                                   \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 90 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nBiotechnology Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n133\n\nThe Index represents the biotechnology segment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S. equity market. The biotechnology\nsegment of the S&P TMI comprises the Biotechnology sub-\nindustry. The Index is one of twenty-one (21) of the S&P\nSelect Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to measure the performance of a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of sub-industries determined based on the\nGlobal Industry Classification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the Select Industry Indices is based on the\nGICS classification, as well as liquidity and market cap\nrequirements. Companies in the Select Industry Indices are\nclassified according to GICS which determines\nclassifications primarily based on revenues; however,\nearnings and market perception are also considered. The\nIndex consists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging to the\nBiotechnology sub-industry that satisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market capitalization\ngreater than or equal to $500 million with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of the index rebalancing reference date)\ngreater than or equal to 90% or have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to $400 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as defined above)\ngreater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar value traded\nfor initial public offerings or spin-offs that do not have\n12 months of trading history is annualized. If there are\nfewer than 35 stocks, stocks from the Life Sciences Tools &\nServices sub-industry that meet the market capitalization\nand liquidity thresholds are included in order of their\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization from largest to\nsmallest. If there continues to be fewer than 22 stocks,\nthe market capitalization threshold may be relaxed to\nensure that there are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of\nthe rebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents\nare removed at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month. The S&P TMI tracks\nall eligible U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 136 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nBiotechnology Companies Risk: Biotech companies invest\nheavily in research and development which may not\nnecessarily lead to commercially successful products. These\ncompanies are also subject to increased governmental\nregulation which may delay or inhibit the release of new\nproducts. Many biotech companies are dependent upon their\nability to use and enforce intellectual property rights and\npatents. Any impairment of such rights may have adverse\nfinancial consequences. Biotech stocks, especially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile\nthan the overall market. Biotech companies can be\nsignificantly affected by technological change and\nobsolescence, product liability lawsuits and consequential\nhigh insurance costs.\n\n134\n\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Health\nCare Sector Risk: Companies in the health care sector are\nsubject to extensive government regulation and their\nprofitability can be significantly affected by restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising\ncosts of medical products and services, pricing pressure\n(including price discounting), limited product lines and an\nincreased emphasis on the delivery of healthcare through\noutpatient services. Companies in the health care sector\nare heavily dependent on obtaining and defending patents,\nwhich may be time consuming and costly, and the expiration\nof patents may also adversely affect the profitability of\nthese companies. Health care companies are also subject to\nextensive litigation based on product liability and similar\nclaims. In addition, their products can become obsolete due\nto industry innovation, changes in technologies or other\nmarket developments. Many new products in the health care\nsector require significant research and development and may\nbe subject to regulatory approvals, all of which may be\ntime consuming and costly with no guarantee that any\nproduct will come to market. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the performance of\nan unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current\nor projected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions.

Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of\nthe Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Raymond Donofrio is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2008. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n136\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com . Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n137\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Capital Markets ETF\n                                                    \n  Investment Objective                              \n  The SPDR S&P Capital Markets ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)     \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before  \n  fees andexpenses, correspond generally to the     \n  total return performance of an index that tracks  \n  the performance ofpublicly traded companies that  \n  do business as broker-dealers, asset managers,    \n  trust and custody banks orexchanges.              \n                                                    \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 23 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nCapital Markets Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n138\n\nThe Index represents the capital markets segment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S. equity market. The capital markets\nsegment of the S&P TMI comprises the following sub-\nindustries: Asset Management & Custody Banks, Diversified\nCapital Markets, Financial Exchanges & Data, and Investment\nBanking & Brokerage. The Index is one of twenty-one (21) of\nthe S&P Select Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each designed to measure the performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined\nbased on the Global Industry Classification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select Industry Indices is\nbased on the GICS classification, as well as liquidity and\nmarket cap requirements. Companies in the Select Industry\nIndices are classified according to GICS which determines\nclassifications primarily based on revenues; however,\nearnings and market perception are also considered. The\nIndex consists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging to the\nAsset Management & Custody Banks, Diversified Capital\nMarkets, Financial Exchanges & Data, and Investment Banking\n& Brokerage sub-industries that satisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market capitalization\ngreater than or equal to $500 million with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of the index rebalancing reference date)\ngreater than or equal to 90% or have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to $400 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as defined above)\ngreater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar value traded\nfor initial public offerings or spin-offs that do not have\n12 months of trading history is annualized. The market\ncapitalization threshold may be relaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month. The S&P TMI tracks\nall eligible U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 63 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nCapital Markets Companies Risk: Capital Markets companies\nmay be significantly affected by stock and bank trading\nactivity, changes in governmental regulation, continuing\nincreases in price competition, decreases in fees or fee-\nrelated business, including investment banking, brokerage,\nasset management and other servicing fees, fluctuation in\ninterest rates and other factors which could adversely\naffect financial markets. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be\ntimes\n\n139\n\nwhen the market price of the shares is more than the net\nasset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is heightened in\ntimes of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments affecting\nissuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will\nhave a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not done\nso. Financial Sector Risk: Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation, which may\nlimit both the amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the interest rates and\nfees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the\nprices they can charge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the\navailability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change or due to\nincreased competition. In addition, deterioration of the\ncredit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n140\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n142\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Dividend ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to    \n  provide investment results that, before fees       \n  andexpenses, correspond generally to the total     \n  return performance of an index that tracks the     \n  performance ofpublicly traded issuers that have    \n  historically followed a policy of making dividend  \n  payments.                                          \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 55 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nHigh Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Swaps and futures contracts (each, a type of\nderivative instrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to the Index and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n143\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of the\nhighest dividend yielding S&P Composite 1500 \u00ae Index (the\n\u201cParent Index\u201d) constituents that have followed a managed-\ndividends policy of consistently increasing dividends every\nyear for at least 20 consecutive years. The Parent Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of the broad exchange-\ntraded US equity securities universe. To be eligible for\ninclusion in the Index, a company must also (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization of at least $2 billion\n($1.5 billion for current Index constituents) and (ii) have\na minimum three-month average daily value traded of at\nleast $5 million ($4 million for current Index\nconstituents). Stocks within the Index are weighted by\nindicated yield (annualized gross dividend payment per\nshare divided by price per share), subject to the following\nconstraints: (i) no stock can have a weight greater than 4%\nin the Index; (ii) no stock can have a weight greater than\n30 times its weight in the Parent Index; and (iii) no stock\ncan have a weight greater than the ratio of its three-month\naverage daily value traded divided by $2 billion. The Index\ncomponents are reviewed annually in January for continued\ninclusion in the Index and re-weighted quarterly after the\nclosing of the last business day of January, April, July\nand October. If between annual reviews the Index Provider\n(as defined below) determines, based on publicly available\ninformation, that an Index constituent has omitted a\nscheduled dividend payment, announced it will cease paying\ndividends for an undetermined period, or announced a\nreduced dividend amount and will no longer qualify for the\nIndex at the subsequent reconstitution, the Index\nconstituent will be removed from the index effective prior\nto the open of the first business day of the following\nmonth. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nFund comprised companies in the financial, utilities and\nreal estate sectors, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised 133 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or\nthe Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition\nof the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Dividend Paying Securities Risk: Securities that pay\ndividends, as a group, can fall out of favor with the\nmarket, causing such companies to underperform companies\nthat do not pay dividends. In addition, changes in the\ndividend policies of the companies held by the Fund or the\ncapital resources available for such company's dividend\npayments may adversely affect the Fund. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Financial Sector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which may limit both the amounts and types of\nloans and other financial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of\nthe credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in\na broad range of markets, including U.S. and international\n\n144\n\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Real Estate Sector Risk: An\ninvestment in a real property company may be subject to\nrisks similar to those associated with direct ownership of\nreal estate, including, by way of example, the possibility\nof declines in the value of real estate, losses from\ncasualty or condemnation, and changes in local and general\neconomic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates,\nenvironmental liability, zoning laws, regulatory\nlimitations on rents, property taxes, and operating\nexpenses. Some real property companies have limited\ndiversification because they invest in a limited number of\nproperties, a narrow geographic area, or a single type of\nproperty. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract that\ngenerally obligates the parties to exchange payments based\non a specified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve\ngreater risks than direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk\n(e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be\npossible for the Fund to liquidate a swap position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result in significant\nlosses.\n\n145\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Utilities Sector Risk: Utility companies are\naffected by supply and demand, operating costs, government\nregulation, environmental factors, liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities, and\nrate caps or rate changes. Although rate changes of a\nutility usually fluctuate in approximate correlation with\nfinancing costs, due to political and regulatory factors\nrate changes ordinarily occur only following a delay after\nthe changes in financing costs. This factor will tend to\nfavorably affect a regulated utility company's earnings and\ndividends in times of decreasing costs, but conversely,\nwill tend to adversely affect earnings and dividends when\ncosts are rising. The value of regulated utility debt\nsecurities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) may\ntend to have an inverse relationship to the movement of\ninterest rates. Certain utility companies have experienced\nfull or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility\ncompanies are frequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater competition\nand have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside\nof their original geographic regions and their traditional\nlines of business. These opportunities may permit certain\nutility companies to earn more than their traditional\nregulated rates of return. Some companies, however, may be\nforced to defend their core business and may be less\nprofitable. In addition, natural disasters, terrorist\nattacks, government intervention or other factors may\nrender a utility company's equipment unusable or obsolete\nand negatively impact profitability. Among the risks that\nmay affect utility companies are the following: risks of\nincreases in fuel and other operating costs; the high cost\nof borrowing to finance capital construction during\ninflationary periods; restrictions on operations and\nincreased costs and delays associated with compliance with\nenvironmental and nuclear safety regulations; and the\ndifficulties involved in obtaining natural gas for resale\nor fuel for generating electricity at reasonable prices.\nOther risks include those related to the construction and\noperation of nuclear power plants, the effects of energy\nconservation and the effects of regulatory changes. Fund\nPerformance The following bar chart and table provide an\nindication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to year and by\nshowing how the Fund's average annual returns for certain\ntime periods compare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities index.

Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head\nof the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Emiliano Rabinovich,\nCFA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 2006. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of\nFund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit\nor delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a\ntax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made\nfrom such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.

A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance.

(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n148\n\nThe Index represents the health care equipment segment of\nthe S&P Total Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the broad U.S. equity market. The health\ncare equipment segment of the S&P TMI comprises the\nfollowing sub-industries: Health Care Equipment and Health\nCare Supplies. The Index is one of twenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each designed to measure the performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined\nbased on the Global Industry Classification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select Industry Indices is\nbased on the GICS classification, as well as liquidity and\nmarket cap requirements. Companies in the Select Industry\nIndices are classified according to GICS which determines\nclassifications primarily based on revenues; however,\nearnings and market perception are also considered. The\nIndex consists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging to the\nHealth Care Equipment and Health Care Services sub-\nindustries that satisfy the following criteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization greater than or equal\nto $500 million with a float-adjusted liquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar value traded over the previous 12 months\ndivided by the float-adjusted market capitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing reference date) greater than or equal\nto 90% or have a float-adjusted market capitalization\ngreater than or equal to $400 million with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as defined above) greater than or equal to\n150%; and (ii) are U.S. based companies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar value traded for initial public\nofferings or spin-offs that do not have 12 months of\ntrading history is annualized. The market capitalization\nthreshold may be relaxed to ensure that there are at least\n22 stocks in the Index as of the rebalancing effective\ndate. Existing Index constituents are removed at the\nquarterly rebalancing effective date if either their float-\nadjusted market capitalization falls below $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted liquidity ratio falls below 50%. The\nmarket capitalization threshold and the liquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from time to time based on market\nconditions. The Index is modified equal weighted. The Index\nrebalances and reconstitutes quarterly on the third Friday\nof the quarter ending month and a secondary reweighting is\nperformed on the third to last business day of the quarter\nending month. The reference date for additions and\ndeletions is after the close of the last trading date of\nthe previous month. The S&P TMI tracks all eligible U.S.\ncommon equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe\nEDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 66 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nHealth Care Equipment Companies Risk: Health care equipment\ncompanies are affected by rising costs of medical products,\ndevices and services and the increased emphasis on the\ndelivery of health care through outpatient services.\nCompetition among health care equipment companies is high\nand can be significantly affected by extensive government\nregulation or government reimbursement for medical\nexpenses. The equipment may be subject to extensive\nlitigation based on malpractice claims, product liability\nclaims or other litigation. Medical equipment manufacturers\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and the\nexpiration of patents may adversely affect their\nprofitability. Many new health care products are subject to\nthe approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(\u201cFDA\u201d). The process of obtaining FDA approval is often\nlong and expensive.\n\n149\n\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Health\nCare Sector Risk: Companies in the health care sector are\nsubject to extensive government regulation and their\nprofitability can be significantly affected by restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising\ncosts of medical products and services, pricing pressure\n(including price discounting), limited product lines and an\nincreased emphasis on the delivery of healthcare through\noutpatient services. Companies in the health care sector\nare heavily dependent on obtaining and defending patents,\nwhich may be time consuming and costly, and the expiration\nof patents may also adversely affect the profitability of\nthese companies. Health care companies are also subject to\nextensive litigation based on product liability and similar\nclaims. In addition, their products can become obsolete due\nto industry innovation, changes in technologies or other\nmarket developments. Many new products in the health care\nsector require significant research and development and may\nbe subject to regulatory approvals, all of which may be\ntime consuming and costly with no guarantee that any\nproduct will come to market. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the performance of\nan unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current\nor projected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n150\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the\nFund will perform in the future.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Kala O'Donnell. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Kala O'Donnell is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 1995. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n151\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n152\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Health Care Services ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)  \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before    \n  feesand expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  total return performance of an index derived from   \n  the health careproviders and services segment of a  \n  U.S. total market composite index.                  \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 37 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nHealth Care Services Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the\nFund is not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index.

There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Health\nCare Sector Risk: Companies in the health care sector are\nsubject to extensive government regulation and their\nprofitability can be significantly affected by restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising\ncosts of medical products and services, pricing pressure\n(including price discounting), limited product lines and an\nincreased emphasis on the delivery of healthcare through\noutpatient services. Companies in the health care sector\nare heavily dependent on obtaining and defending patents,\nwhich may be time consuming and costly, and the expiration\nof patents may also adversely affect the profitability of\nthese companies. Health care companies are also subject to\nextensive litigation based on product liability and similar\nclaims. In addition, their products can become obsolete due\nto industry innovation, changes in technologies or other\nmarket developments. Many new products in the health care\nsector require significant research and development and may\nbe subject to regulatory approvals, all of which may be\ntime consuming and costly with no guarantee that any\nproduct will come to market. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the performance of\nan unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current\nor projected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n155\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Raymond Donofrio. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of\nthe Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Raymond Donofrio is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2008. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n156\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n157\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Homebuilders ETF\n                                                    \n  Investment Objective                              \n  The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks  \n  to provide investment results that, before fees   \n  andexpenses, correspond generally to the total    \n  return performance of an index derived from the   \n  homebuildingsegment of a U.S. total market        \n  composite index.                                  \n                                                    \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 45 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nHomebuilders Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n158\n\nThe Index represents the homebuilders segment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S. equity market. The homebuilders\nsegment of the S&P TMI comprises the Homebuilding sub-\nindustry. The Index is one of twenty-one (21) of the S&P\nSelect Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to measure the performance of a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of sub-industries determined based on the\nGlobal Industry Classification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the Select Industry Indices is based on the\nGICS classification, as well as liquidity and market cap\nrequirements. Companies in the Select Industry Indices are\nclassified according to GICS which determines\nclassifications primarily based on revenues; however,\nearnings and market perception are also considered. The\nIndex consists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging to the\nHomebuilding sub-industry that satisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market capitalization\ngreater than or equal to $500 million with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of the index rebalancing reference date)\ngreater than or equal to 90% or have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to $400 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as defined above)\ngreater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar value traded\nfor initial public offerings or spin-offs that do not have\n12 months of trading history is annualized. If there are\nfewer than 35 stocks, stocks from the Building Products,\nHome Furnishings, Home Improvement Retail, Homefurnishing\nRetail, or Household Appliances sub-industries that meet\nthe market capitalization and liquidity thresholds are\nincluded in order of their float-adjusted market\ncapitalization from largest to smallest. If there continues\nto be fewer than 22 stocks, the market capitalization\nthreshold may be relaxed to ensure that there are at least\n22 stocks in the Index as of the rebalancing effective\ndate. Existing Index constituents are removed at the\nquarterly rebalancing effective date if either their float-\nadjusted market capitalization falls below $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted liquidity ratio falls below 50%. The\nmarket capitalization threshold and the liquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from time to time based on market\nconditions. The Index is modified equal weighted. The Index\nrebalances and reconstitutes quarterly on the third Friday\nof the quarter ending month and a secondary reweighting is\nperformed on the third to last business day of the quarter\nending month. The reference date for additions and\ndeletions is after the close of the last trading date of\nthe previous month. The S&P TMI tracks all eligible U.S.\ncommon equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe\nEDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 35 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nHomebuilding Companies Risk: Homebuilding companies can be\nsignificantly affected by the national, regional and local\nreal estate markets. This industry is also sensitive to\ninterest rate fluctuations which can cause changes in the\navailability of mortgage capital and directly affect the\npurchasing power of potential homebuyers. The building\nindustry can be significantly affected by changes in\ngovernment spending, consumer confidence, demographic\npatterns and the level of new and existing home sales.\n\n159\n\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector Risk: The success of consumer product\nmanufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the\nperformance of the overall global economy, interest rates,\ncompetition and consumer confidence. Success depends\nheavily on disposable household income and consumer\nspending. Also, companies in the consumer discretionary\nsector may be subject to severe competition, which may have\nan adverse impact on their respective profitability.\nChanges in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect\nthe demand for, and success of, consumer products and\nservices in the marketplace. Futures Contract Risk: A\nfutures contract is a standardized agreement that calls for\nthe purchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific\nprice at a specific future time, or cash settlement of the\nterms of the contract. Transactions in futures contracts\ncan create investment leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a futures contract\ntransaction will result in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may not be able to\nclose out the futures contract at a favorable time or\nprice. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market\non an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies\n\n160\n\nare heavily influenced by governmental defense spending\npolicies which are typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol the U.S. (and other) government budgets.\nTransportation securities, another component of the\nindustrial sector, are cyclical and have occasional sharp\nprice movements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and insurance costs.\nRetail Companies Risk: Retail companies can be\nsignificantly affected by the performance of the domestic\nand international economy, consumer confidence and\nspending, intense competition, changes in demographics, and\nchanging consumer tastes and preferences.

Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 23 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nInsurance Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n163\n\nThe Index represents the insurance segment of the S&P Total\nMarket Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to track\nthe broad U.S. equity market. The insurance segment of the\nS&P TMI comprises the following sub-industries: Insurance\nBrokers, Life & Health Insurance, Multi-Line Insurance,\nProperty & Casualty Insurance, and Reinsurance. The Index\nis one of twenty-one (21) of the S&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d), each designed to\nmeasure the performance of a narrow sub-industry or group\nof sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select\nIndustry Indices is based on the GICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and market cap requirements. Companies in\nthe Select Industry Indices are classified according to\nGICS which determines classifications primarily based on\nrevenues; however, earnings and market perception are also\nconsidered. The Index consists of the S&P TMI constituents\nbelonging to the Insurance Brokers, Life & Health\nInsurance, Multi-Line Insurance, Property & Casualty\nInsurance, and Reinsurance sub-industries that satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market\ncapitalization above $2 billion with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of the index rebalancing reference date)\nabove 90%; and (ii) are U.S. based companies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar value traded for initial public\nofferings or spin-offs that do not have 12 months of\ntrading history is annualized. The market capitalization\nthreshold may be relaxed to ensure that there are at least\n22 stocks in the Index as of the rebalancing effective\ndate. Existing Index constituents are removed at the\nquarterly rebalancing effective date if either their float-\nadjusted market capitalization falls below $1 billion or\ntheir float-adjusted liquidity ratio falls below 50%. The\nmarket capitalization threshold and the liquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from time to time based on market\nconditions. The Index is modified equal weighted. The Index\nrebalances and reconstitutes quarterly on the third Friday\nof the quarter ending month and a secondary reweighting is\nperformed on the third to last business day of the quarter\nending month. The reference date for additions and\ndeletions is after the close of the last trading date of\nthe previous month. The S&P TMI tracks all eligible U.S.\ncommon equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe\nEDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 49 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nInsurance Companies Risk: Insurance companies' profits are\naffected by many factors, including interest rate\nmovements, the imposition of premium rate caps, competition\nand pressure to compete globally. Certain types of\ninsurance companies may also be affected by weather\ncatastrophes and other disasters and mortality rates. In\naddition, although insurance companies are currently\nsubject to extensive regulation, such companies may be\nadversely affected by increased governmental regulations or\ntax law changes in the future. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines.\n\n164\n\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation, which may limit both the\namounts and types of loans and other financial commitments\nthey can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge,\nthe scope of their activities, the prices they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an\nadverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money markets\ngenerally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets. Certain events in the financial\nsector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in\nthe financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause\ncertain financial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n165\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 38 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nKensho Clean Power Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n168\n\nThe Index is comprised of U.S.-listed equity securities\n(including depositary receipts) of companies domiciled\nacross developed and emerging markets worldwide which are\nincluded in the Clean Power sector as determined by a\nclassification standard produced by S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The Index is designed to\ncapture companies whose products and services are driving\ninnovation behind clean power. In particular, the Index\ncomprises the components of the S&P Kensho Cleantech Index\nfocused on clean energy technology (hardware, software, and\nconstruction and installation of materials used for\ncapturing energy, as well as advanced energy storage\ndevices), and the S&P Kensho Clean Energy Index focused on\nclean energy generation (generation and transmission of\npower derived from clean energy sources) (the \u201cUnderlying\nIndexes\u201d) as of the Index's reconstitution reference date.\nThe Underlying Indexes are subject to the following\nliquidity thresholds for each component: (i) must have a\nshare price of at least USD $1.00; (ii) must be issued by a\ncompany with a minimum float market capitalization of at\nleast $100 million; and (iii) must have a minimum three-\nmonth average daily traded value of at least $1 million.\nThe S&P Kensho Cleantech Index seeks to track companies\nfocused on building technologies or products that enable\ngeneration of energy in a clean manner (solar, wind,\ngeothermal, hydrogen and hydroelectric). The S&P Kensho\nClean Energy Index seeks to track companies focused on the\ngeneration and transmission of energy derived from clean\nsources (solar, wind, geothermal, hydrogen and\nhydroelectric). To determine the constituents of the\nUnderlying Indexes, the Index Provider's classification\nstandard utilizes an automated scan of companies' most\nrecent regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission on Form 10-K, Form 20-F, Form 40-F, or\nForm S-1, as applicable, maintained in the S&P Market\nIntelligence United Document Repository, to identify\nspecific search terms and phrases that describe a company\nas producing products and services related to the\nparticular segment targeted by the Underlying Index. The\nresulting list of eligible securities for each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered by eliminating companies that do not\ninclude in their regulatory filings a reference to a\nproduct or service that (i) is related to a search term or\nphrase and (ii) is used in a manner that is within the\nscope of the Underlying Index's objective. Each Underlying\nIndex then screens the remaining securities to remove\nsecurities that are not listed on NYSE, NASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an affiliate of one of those exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain minimum liquidity thresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index Committee then reviews each remaining\neligible constituent to verify the rules of the automated\nscan were implemented correctly. Underlying Index\nconstituents are then categorized as either \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is categorized as Core if its products and\nservices related to the Underlying Index's objective are\nidentified in its regulatory filings as principal\ncomponents of the company's strategy. Products and services\nare deemed to be principal components of a company's\nstrategy if the company's regulatory filing disclosures\nregarding such products and services are determined to be\nsufficiently prominent according to a proprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider which calculates prominence based on\nthe frequency and position of such disclosures within\nregulatory filings. A company may also be categorized as\nCore if the Index Provider determines that the majority of\nthe company's revenue is derived from products and services\nrelated to the Underlying Index's objective as indicated by\nthe company's reported business segments, which is assessed\nby scanning the S&P Capital IQ Database for annual fiscal\nyear revenue segment reporting. All other companies are\ncategorized as Non-Core, including companies whose products\nand services are identified as forming a necessary\ncomponent of the supply chain of the segment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index. An Index constituent categorized as\nCore by at least one of the Underlying Indexes will be\ncategorized as Core for purposes of the Index. At the time\nof each rebalance, to tilt the Index's exposure toward Core\nIndex Constituents, the Core Index Constituents are\nsystematically overweighted relative to the Non-Core Index\nConstituents. Each Core Index Constituent and Non-Core\nIndex Constituent is then equally weighted within the group\nof Core Index Constituents and Non-Core Index Constituents,\nrespectively, subject to liquidity and diversification\nadjustments. The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced\nafter the close of trading on the third Friday in June with\na reference date as of the close of the last trading day in\nMay. In addition, the Index is rebalanced after the close\nof trading on the third Friday of December with a reference\ndate as of the close of the last trading day in November.\nIn connection with the December rebalance, Index\nconstituents are also evaluated for continued inclusion in\nthe Index if a new eligible regulatory filing has been\nfiled since the last reconstitution review. As of July 31,\n2024, the Index comprised 44 securities. The Index Provider\nis not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index\nProvider establishes and maintains rules which are used to\ndetermine the composition of the Index and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the Fund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will\nchange in value, and you could lose money by investing in\nthe Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency.\n\n169\n\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nClean Power Companies Risk : Clean power companies may be\nhighly dependent upon government subsidies, contracts with\ngovernment entities, and the successful development of new\nand proprietary technologies. Clean power companies may be\naffected by competition from new and existing market\nentrants, obsolescence of technology, short product cycles,\nchanges in exchange rates, imposition of import controls,\nand depletion of resources. In addition, seasonal weather\nconditions, fluctuations in supply of and demand for clean\nenergy products or services, and international political\nevents may cause fluctuations in the performance of clean\npower companies and the prices of their securities. Risks\nassociated with fluctuations in energy prices and supply\nand demand of alternative energy fuels, energy\nconservation, the success of exploration projects and tax\nand other government regulations can significantly affect\nclean power companies. Cybersecurity-Related Risk: The\ncompanies included in the Index rely on technologies such\nas the Internet and depend on computer systems to perform\nbusiness and operational functions, and therefore may be\nprone to operational and information security risks\nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or technological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or digitally,\npreventing legitimate users from accessing information or\nservices on a website, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, and causing operational disruption.\nIn general, cyber-attacks are deliberate, but unintentional\nevents may have similar effects. Successful cyber-attacks\nagainst, or security breakdowns of, a company included in\nthe Index may result in material adverse consequences for\nsuch company, as well as other companies included in the\nIndex, and may cause the Fund's investments to lose value.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Depositary\nReceipts Risk: Investments in depositary receipts may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the underlying\nsecurities in their primary trading market. If a depositary\nreceipt is denominated in a different currency than its\nunderlying securities, the Fund will be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both the investment in the depositary\nreceipt and the underlying security. Holders of depositary\nreceipts may have limited or no rights to take action with\nrespect to the underlying securities or to compel the\nissuer of the receipts to take action. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may differ from the prices of\nsecurities upon which they are based. To the extent the\nFund invests in depositary receipts based on securities\nincluded in the Index, such differences in prices may\nincrease index tracking risk. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks\nof investing in emerging markets include, among others,\ngreater political and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less developed\nsecurities markets, increased potential for market\nmanipulation, possible trade barriers, currency transfer\nrestrictions, a more limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue\nfrom particular commodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation, unavailability of\ncurrency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation, nationalization, embargo, and acts\nof war. The securities of\n\n170\n\nemerging market companies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections may limit\nvery significantly the liquidity of securities of certain\ncompanies in a particular country or geographic region, or\nof all companies in the country or region. The Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any\ntime, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Large-Capitalization Securities Risk:\nReturns on investments in securities of large companies\ncould trail the returns on investments in securities of\nsmaller and mid-sized companies. Larger companies may be\nunable to respond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies to competitive challenges or to changes in\nbusiness, product, financial, or other market conditions.\nLarger companies may not be able to maintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be achieved by well-managed smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\n\n171\n\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market\nconditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or\nprice or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid investments and may\nbe subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the\nFund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling\nsuch investments, may be unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization Securities Risk: The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a\nforeign currency, there are special risks such as changes\nin currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Investments in\ndepositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of smaller companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may have\nsignificant volatility. The Fund may be unable to liquidate\nits positions in such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations.\nReturns on investments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger companies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or economic factors impacting\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both domestically\nand internationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Technology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nUtilities Sector Risk: Utility companies are affected by\nsupply and demand, operating costs, government regulation,\nenvironmental factors, liabilities for environmental damage\nand general civil liabilities, and rate caps or rate\nchanges. Although rate changes of a utility usually\nfluctuate in approximate correlation with financing costs,\ndue to political and regulatory factors rate changes\nordinarily occur only following a delay after the changes\nin\n\n172\n\nfinancing costs. This factor will tend to favorably affect\na regulated utility company's earnings and dividends in\ntimes of decreasing costs, but conversely, will tend to\nadversely affect earnings and dividends when costs are\nrising. The value of regulated utility debt securities\n(and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) may tend to\nhave an inverse relationship to the movement of interest\nrates. Certain utility companies have experienced full or\npartial deregulation in recent years. These utility\ncompanies are frequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater competition\nand have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside\nof their original geographic regions and their traditional\nlines of business. These opportunities may permit certain\nutility companies to earn more than their traditional\nregulated rates of return. Some companies, however, may be\nforced to defend their core business and may be less\nprofitable. In addition, natural disasters, terrorist\nattacks, government intervention or other factors may\nrender a utility company's equipment unusable or obsolete\nand negatively impact profitability. Among the risks that\nmay affect utility companies are the following: risks of\nincreases in fuel and other operating costs; the high cost\nof borrowing to finance capital construction during\ninflationary periods; restrictions on operations and\nincreased costs and delays associated with compliance with\nenvironmental and nuclear safety regulations; and the\ndifficulties involved in obtaining natural gas for resale\nor fuel for generating electricity at reasonable prices.\nOther risks include those related to the construction and\noperation of nuclear power plants, the effects of energy\nconservation and the effects of regulatory changes.\nValuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to\nvalue a portfolio holding when market quotations are not\nreadily available. The value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from what would be\nproduced using a different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are\nvalued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the\nnext than if market quotations were used. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out\na portfolio position for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a\nloss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at\na discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table\nprovide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund\nby showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns\nfor certain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. 173\n                                                                                       \n                                                   OneYear  FiveYears  SinceInception  \n  10/22/2018                                                                           \n  Return Before Taxes                              -11.42%  21.65%     19.94%          \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions              -11.82%  21.06%     19.36%          \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of  -6.75%   17.54%     16.10%          \n  Fund Shares                                                                          \n  S&P Kensho Clean Power Index (reflects no        -11.05%  21.97%     20.26%          \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                               \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,   26.29%   15.69%     13.08%          \n  expenses or taxes)                                                                   \n                                                                                       \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Kathleen\nMorgan and Mark Krivitsky. Kathleen Morgan, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 2017. Mark Krivitsky is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group and the Tax-\nEfficient Market Capture Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national\nsecurities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k)\nplan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be\ntaxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services\nrelated to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another\ninvestment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n174\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Kensho Final Frontiers ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Kensho Final Frontiers ETF (the       \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the total return performance of the S&P Kensho     \n  Final FrontiersIndex.                              \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.45%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 21 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nKensho Final Frontiers Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n175\n\nThe Index is comprised of U.S.-listed equity securities\n(including depositary receipts) of companies domiciled\nacross developed and emerging markets worldwide which are\nincluded in the Final Frontiers sector as determined by a\nclassification standard produced by S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The Index is designed to\ncapture companies whose products and services are driving\ninnovation behind the exploration of deep space and deep\nsea. In particular, the Index comprises the components of\nthe S&P Kensho Space Index and the deep sea exploration\ncomponents of the S&P Kensho Drones Index (the \u201cUnderlying\nIndexes\u201d) as of the Index's reconstitution reference date.\nThe Underlying Indexes are subject to the following\nliquidity thresholds for each component: (i) must have a\nshare price of at least USD $1.00; (ii) must be issued by a\ncompany with a minimum float market capitalization of at\nleast $100 million; and (iii) must have a minimum three-\nmonth average daily traded value of at least $1 million.\nThe S&P Kensho Space Index seeks to track companies that\nproduce products and services that enable space travel and\nexploration, or are a necessary component of the supply\nchain for such products and services. The S&P Kensho Drones\nIndex seeks to track companies that produce products and\nservices related to the remotely-operated or unmanned\naerial, underwater and surface-level drones market, or are\na necessary component of the supply chain for such products\nand services. To determine the constituents of the\nUnderlying Indexes, the Index Provider's classification\nstandard utilizes an automated scan of companies' most\nrecent regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission on Form 10-K, Form 20-F, Form 40-F, or\nForm S-1, as applicable, maintained in the S&P Market\nIntelligence United Document Repository, to identify\nspecific search terms and phrases that describe a company\nas producing products and services related to the\nparticular segment targeted by the Underlying Index. The\nresulting list of eligible securities for each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered by eliminating companies that do not\ninclude in their regulatory filings a reference to a\nproduct or service that (i) is related to a search term or\nphrase and (ii) is used in a manner that is within the\nscope of the Underlying Index's objective. Each Underlying\nIndex then screens the remaining securities to remove\nsecurities that are not listed on NYSE, NASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an affiliate of one of those exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain minimum liquidity thresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index Committee then reviews each remaining\neligible constituent to verify the rules of the automated\nscan were implemented correctly. Underlying Index\nconstituents are then categorized as either \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is categorized as Core if its products and\nservices related to the Underlying Index's objective are\nidentified in its regulatory filings as principal\ncomponents of the company's strategy. Products and services\nare deemed to be principal components of a company's\nstrategy if the company's regulatory filing disclosures\nregarding such products and services are determined to be\nsufficiently prominent according to a proprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider which calculates prominence based on\nthe frequency and position of such disclosures within\nregulatory filings. A company may also be categorized as\nCore if the Index Provider determines that the majority of\nthe company's revenue is derived from products and services\nrelated to the Underlying Index's objective as indicated by\nthe company's reported business segments, which is assessed\nby scanning the S&P Capital IQ Database for annual fiscal\nyear revenue segment reporting. All other companies are\ncategorized as Non-Core, including companies whose products\nand services are identified as forming a necessary\ncomponent of the supply chain of the segment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index. An Index constituent categorized as\nCore by at least one of the Underlying Indexes will be\ncategorized as Core for purposes of the Index. At the time\nof each rebalance, to tilt the Index's exposure toward Core\nIndex Constituents, the Core Index Constituents are\nsystematically overweighted relative to the Non-Core Index\nConstituents. Each Core Index Constituent and Non-Core\nIndex Constituent is then equally weighted within the group\nof Core Index Constituents and Non-Core Index Constituents,\nrespectively, subject to liquidity and diversification\nadjustments. The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced\nafter the close of trading on the third Friday in June with\na reference date as of the close of the last trading day in\nMay. In addition, the Index is rebalanced after the close\nof trading on the third Friday of December with a reference\ndate as of the close of the last trading day in November.\nIn connection with the December rebalance, Index\nconstituents are also evaluated for continued inclusion in\nthe Index if a new eligible regulatory filing has been\nfiled since the last reconstitution review. As of July 31,\n2024, the Index comprised 31 securities. The Index Provider\nis not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index\nProvider establishes and maintains rules which are used to\ndetermine the composition of the Index and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the Fund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will\nchange in value, and you could lose money by investing in\nthe Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency.\n\n176\n\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nAerospace and Defense Companies Risk: Aerospace and defense\ncompanies can be significantly affected by government\naerospace and defense regulation and spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry rely to a\nsignificant extent on U.S. (and other) government demand\nfor their products and services. Thus, the financial\ncondition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by governmental\ndefense spending policies which are typically under\npressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Drone Companies Risk: Drone companies\nmay have limited product lines, markets, financial\nresources or personnel and are subject to the risks of\nchanges in business cycles, world economic growth,\ntechnological progress, and government regulation.\nSecurities of drone companies, especially smaller, start-up\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than securities of\ncompanies that do not rely heavily on technology. These\ncompanies may face intense competition and potentially\nrapid product obsolescence. In addition, drone companies\nmay be dependent on the U.S. government and its agencies\nfor a significant portion of their sales, and their success\nand growth may be dependent on their ability to win future\ngovernment contracts. As a result, such companies may be\nnegatively affected by budgetary constraints, spending\nreductions, congressional appropriations, and\nadministrative allocations of funds that affect the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies. Drone companies may rely on a\ncombination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade\nsecret laws to establish and protect their proprietary\nrights in their products and technologies, and may be\nadversely affected by loss or impairment of those rights.\nLegal and regulatory changes may have an impact on a drone\ncompany's products or services. In addition, drone\ncompanies may also be subject to increasing regulatory\nconstraints that may limit the sale or use of a company's\nproducts, including the need to obtain regulatory approvals\nfrom certain government agencies. Drone companies typically\nengage in significant amounts of spending on research and\ndevelopment, and there is no guarantee that the products or\nservices produced by these companies will be successful.\nCybersecurity-Related Risk: The companies included in the\nIndex rely on technologies such as the Internet and depend\non computer systems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, and therefore may be prone to operational and\ninformation security risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. Cyber-attacks include,\namong others, stealing or corrupting data maintained online\nor digitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing\ninformation or services on a website, releasing\nconfidential information without authorization, and causing\noperational disruption. In general, cyber-attacks are\ndeliberate, but unintentional events may have similar\neffects. Successful cyber-attacks against, or security\nbreakdowns of, a company included in the Index may result\nin material adverse consequences for such company, as well\nas other companies included in the Index, and may cause the\nFund's investments to lose value. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments in a particular industry or sector,\nfinancial, economic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic\nsector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\n\n177\n\nDepositary Receipts Risk: Investments in depositary\nreceipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the\nunderlying securities in their primary trading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is denominated in a different currency\nthan its underlying securities, the Fund will be subject to\nthe currency risk of both the investment in the depositary\nreceipt and the underlying security. Holders of depositary\nreceipts may have limited or no rights to take action with\nrespect to the underlying securities or to compel the\nissuer of the receipts to take action. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may differ from the prices of\nsecurities upon which they are based. To the extent the\nFund invests in depositary receipts based on securities\nincluded in the Index, such differences in prices may\nincrease index tracking risk. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks\nof investing in emerging markets include, among others,\ngreater political and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less developed\nsecurities markets, increased potential for market\nmanipulation, possible trade barriers, currency transfer\nrestrictions, a more limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue\nfrom particular commodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation, unavailability of\ncurrency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation, nationalization, embargo, and acts\nof war. The securities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial\nmarket corrections may limit very significantly the\nliquidity of securities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of all\ncompanies in the country or region. The Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its positions in such securities at any time,\nor at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n178\n\nIndustrial Sector Risk: Industrial companies are affected\nby supply and demand both for their specific product or\nservice and for industrial sector products and services in\ngeneral. Government regulation, world events, exchange\nrates and economic conditions, technological developments\nand liabilities for environmental damage and general civil\nliabilities will likewise affect the performance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of\nthe industrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Large-Capitalization Securities Risk:\nReturns on investments in securities of large companies\ncould trail the returns on investments in securities of\nsmaller and mid-sized companies. Larger companies may be\nunable to respond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies to competitive challenges or to changes in\nbusiness, product, financial, or other market conditions.\nLarger companies may not be able to maintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be achieved by well-managed smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Mid-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk: The securities of mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile and may involve more risk\nthan the securities of larger companies. These companies\nmay have limited product lines, markets or financial\nresources, may lack the competitive strength of larger\ncompanies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a\nforeign currency, there are special risks such as changes\nin currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Investments in\ndepositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of smaller companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may have\nsignificant volatility. The Fund may be unable to liquidate\nits positions in such securities\n\n179\n\nat any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the\nFund's obligations. Returns on investments in securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger companies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or economic factors impacting\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both domestically\nand internationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Technology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nValuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to\nvalue a portfolio holding when market quotations are not\nreadily available. The value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from what would be\nproduced using a different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are\nvalued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the\nnext than if market quotations were used. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out\na portfolio position for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a\nloss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at\na discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table\nprovide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund\nby showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns\nfor certain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Kala\nO'Donnell and Kathleen Morgan. Kala O'Donnell is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 1995. Kathleen Morgan, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a\ntax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made\nfrom such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n181\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Kensho Future Security ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Kensho Future Security ETF (the       \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the total return performance of the S&P Kensho     \n  Future SecurityIndex.                              \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.45%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 32 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nKensho Future Security Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n182\n\nThe Index is comprised of U.S.-listed equity securities\n(including depositary receipts) of companies domiciled\nacross developed and emerging markets worldwide which are\nincluded in the Future Security sector as determined by a\nclassification standard produced by S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The Index is designed to\ncapture companies whose products and services are driving\ninnovation behind future security. In particular, the Index\ncomprises the components of the S&P Kensho Cyber Security\nIndex and the S&P Kensho Smart Borders Index, and the\nmilitary components of the S&P Kensho Robotics Index, the\nS&P Kensho Drones Index, the S&P Kensho Space Index, the\nS&P Kensho Wearables Index and the S&P Kensho Virtual\nReality Index (the \u201cUnderlying Indexes\u201d) as of the Index's\nreconstitution reference date. The Underlying Indexes are\nsubject to the following liquidity thresholds for each\ncomponent: (i) must have a share price of at least USD\n$1.00; (ii) must be issued by a company with a minimum\nfloat market capitalization of at least $100 million; and\n(iii) must have a minimum three-month average daily traded\nvalue of at least $1 million. The S&P Kensho Cyber Security\nIndex seeks to track companies that focus on protecting\nenterprises and devices from unauthorized access via\nelectronic means and, produce products and services that\nprotect enterprises, homes and portable devices from\nunauthorized access via electronic means, or are a\nnecessary component of the supply chain for such products\nand services. The S&P Kensho Smart Borders Index seeks to\ntrack companies that produce products and services that\nsecure borders and critical infrastructure, or are a\nnecessary component of the supply chain for such products\nand services. The S&P Kensho Robotics Index seeks to track\ncompanies that produce products and services to build\nrobotic products and their subsystems, or are a necessary\ncomponent of the supply chain for such products and\nservices. The S&P Kensho Drones Index seeks to track\ncompanies that produce products and services related to the\nremotely-operated or unmanned aerial, underwater and\nsurface-level drones market and related subsystems, or are\na necessary component of the supply chain for such products\nand services. The S&P Kensho Space Index seeks to track\ncompanies that produce products and services that enable\nspace travel and exploration, or are a necessary component\nof the supply chain for such products and services. The S&P\nKensho Wearables Index seeks to track companies that\nproduce products and services related to wearable\ntechnologies for consumer, military or medical uses, or are\na necessary component of the supply chain for such products\nand services. The S&P Kensho Virtual Reality Index seeks to\ntrack companies that produce products and services related\nto virtual or augmented reality activities, or are a\nnecessary component of the supply chain for such products\nand services. To determine the constituents of the\nUnderlying Indexes, the Index Provider's classification\nstandard utilizes an automated scan of companies' most\nrecent regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission on Form 10-K, Form 20-F, Form 40-F, or\nForm S-1, as applicable, maintained in the S&P Market\nIntelligence United Document Repository, to identify\nspecific search terms and phrases that describe a company\nas producing products and services related to the\nparticular segment targeted by the Underlying Index. The\nresulting list of eligible securities for each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered by eliminating companies that do not\ninclude in their regulatory filings a reference to a\nproduct or service that (i) is related to a search term or\nphrase and (ii) is used in a manner that is within the\nscope of the Underlying Index's objective. Each Underlying\nIndex then screens the remaining securities to remove\nsecurities that are not listed on NYSE, NASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an affiliate of one of those exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain minimum liquidity thresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index Committee then reviews each remaining\neligible constituent to verify the rules of the automated\nscan were implemented correctly. Underlying Index\nconstituents are then categorized as either \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is categorized as Core if its products and\nservices related to the Underlying Index's objective are\nidentified in its regulatory filings as principal\ncomponents of the company's strategy. Products and services\nare deemed to be principal components of a company's\nstrategy if the company's regulatory filing disclosures\nregarding such products and services are determined to be\nsufficiently prominent according to a proprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider which calculates prominence based on\nthe frequency and position of such disclosures within\nregulatory filings. A company may also be categorized as\nCore if the Index Provider determines that the majority of\nthe company's revenue is derived from products and services\nrelated to the Underlying Index's objective as indicated by\nthe company's reported business segments, which is assessed\nby scanning the S&P Capital IQ Database for annual fiscal\nyear revenue segment reporting. All other companies are\ncategorized as Non-Core, including companies whose products\nand services are identified as forming a necessary\ncomponent of the supply chain of the segment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index. An Index constituent categorized as\nCore by at least one of the Underlying Indexes will be\ncategorized as Core for purposes of the Index. To tilt the\nIndex's exposure toward Core Index Constituents, at the\ntime of each rebalance the aggregate weighting of Core\nIndex Constituents is based on the proportion of the number\nof Core Index Constituents, plus an overweight factor of up\nto 20%. At the time of each rebalance, each Core Index\nConstituent and Non-Core Index Constituent is equally\nweighted within the group of Core Index Constituents and\nNon-Core Index Constituents, respectively, subject to\nliquidity and diversification adjustments.\n\n183\n\nThe Index is reconstituted and rebalanced after the close\nof trading on the third Friday in June with a reference\ndate as of the close of the last trading day in May. In\naddition, the Index is rebalanced after the close of\ntrading on the third Friday of December with a reference\ndate as of the close of the last trading day in November.\nIn connection with the December rebalance, Index\nconstituents are also evaluated for continued inclusion in\nthe Index if a new eligible regulatory filing has been\nfiled since the last reconstitution review. As of July 31,\n2024, the Index comprised 64 securities. The Index Provider\nis not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index\nProvider establishes and maintains rules which are used to\ndetermine the composition of the Index and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the Fund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will\nchange in value, and you could lose money by investing in\nthe Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. Market Risk: The Fund's\ninvestments are subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and the risks\ninherent in investment in securities markets. Investment\nmarkets can be volatile and prices of investments can\nchange substantially due to various factors including, but\nnot limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in\ninterest rates, inflation, changes in the actual or\nperceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market\nliquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk that\ngeopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and\nadversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nAerospace and Defense Companies Risk: Aerospace and defense\ncompanies can be significantly affected by government\naerospace and defense regulation and spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry rely to a\nsignificant extent on U.S. (and other) government demand\nfor their products and services. Thus, the financial\ncondition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by governmental\ndefense spending policies which are typically under\npressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Cybersecurity Companies Risk: Companies\nin the cybersecurity field face intense competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, which may have an adverse\neffect on profit margins. Cybersecurity companies may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. The products of cybersecurity companies may face\nobsolescence due to rapid technological developments and\nfrequent new product introduction, and such companies may\nface unpredictable changes in growth rates, competition for\nthe services of qualified personnel and competition from\nforeign competitors with lower production costs. Companies\nin the cybersecurity field are heavily dependent on patent\nand intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of\nthese rights may adversely affect the profitability of\nthese companies. Cybersecurity-Related Risk: The companies\nincluded in the Index rely on technologies such as the\nInternet and depend on computer systems to perform business\nand operational functions, and therefore may be prone to\noperational and information security risks resulting from\ncyber-attacks and/or technological malfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among others, stealing or corrupting data\nmaintained online or digitally, preventing legitimate users\nfrom accessing information or services on a website,\nreleasing confidential information without authorization,\nand causing operational disruption. In general, cyber-\nattacks are deliberate, but unintentional events may have\nsimilar effects. Successful cyber-attacks against, or\nsecurity breakdowns of, a company included in the Index may\nresult in material adverse consequences for such company,\nas well as other companies included in the Index, and may\ncause the Fund's investments to lose value. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and\nsold in the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines.\n\n184\n\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Depositary\nReceipts Risk: Investments in depositary receipts may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the underlying\nsecurities in their primary trading market. If a depositary\nreceipt is denominated in a different currency than its\nunderlying securities, the Fund will be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both the investment in the depositary\nreceipt and the underlying security. Holders of depositary\nreceipts may have limited or no rights to take action with\nrespect to the underlying securities or to compel the\nissuer of the receipts to take action. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may differ from the prices of\nsecurities upon which they are based. To the extent the\nFund invests in depositary receipts based on securities\nincluded in the Index, such differences in prices may\nincrease index tracking risk. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks\nof investing in emerging markets include, among others,\ngreater political and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less developed\nsecurities markets, increased potential for market\nmanipulation, possible trade barriers, currency transfer\nrestrictions, a more limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue\nfrom particular commodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation, unavailability of\ncurrency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation, nationalization, embargo, and acts\nof war. The securities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial\nmarket corrections may limit very significantly the\nliquidity of securities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of all\ncompanies in the country or region. The Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its positions in such securities at any time,\nor at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser\n\n185\n\nmay attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Large-Capitalization Securities Risk:\nReturns on investments in securities of large companies\ncould trail the returns on investments in securities of\nsmaller and mid-sized companies. Larger companies may be\nunable to respond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies to competitive challenges or to changes in\nbusiness, product, financial, or other market conditions.\nLarger companies may not be able to maintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be achieved by well-managed smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Mid-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk: The securities of mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile and may involve more risk\nthan the securities of larger companies. These companies\nmay have limited product lines, markets or financial\nresources, may lack the competitive strength of larger\ncompanies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a\nforeign currency, there are special risks such as changes\nin currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Investments in\ndepositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few\n\n186\n\nkey employees. In addition, these companies may have been\nrecently organized and may have little or no track record\nof success. The securities of smaller companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely\nheld securities. Some securities of smaller issuers may be\nilliquid or may be restricted as to resale, and their\nvalues may have significant volatility. The Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any\ntime, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. Returns on investments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger companies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or economic factors impacting\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both domestically\nand internationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Technology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nValuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to\nvalue a portfolio holding when market quotations are not\nreadily available. The value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from what would be\nproduced using a different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are\nvalued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the\nnext than if market quotations were used. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out\na portfolio position for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a\nloss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at\na discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table\nprovide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund\nby showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns\nfor certain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Kathleen\nMorgan and Kala O'Donnell. Kathleen Morgan, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 2017. Kala O'Donnell is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 1995. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a\ntax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made\nfrom such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n188\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Kensho Intelligent Structures ETF\n                                                    \n  Investment Objective                              \n  The SPDR S&P Kensho Intelligent Structures ETF    \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results  \n  that,before fees and expenses, correspond         \n  generally to the total return performance of the  \n  S&P KenshoIntelligent Infrastructure Index.       \n                                                    \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.45%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 31 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nKensho Intelligent Infrastructure Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n189\n\nThe Index is comprised of U.S.-listed equity securities\n(including depositary receipts) of companies domiciled\nacross developed and emerging markets worldwide which are\nincluded in the Intelligent Infrastructure sector as\ndetermined by a classification standard produced by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The Index is\ndesigned to capture companies whose products and services\nare driving innovation behind intelligent infrastructure.\nIn particular, the Index comprises the components of the\n(i) S&P Kensho Smart Grids Index focused on power grid\ntechnologies (with an emphasis on efficient management and\nuse of energy, and improved power grid reliability),\ntransportation infrastructure (with an emphasis on\nenhancing the efficiency of transportation infrastructure,\nas well as the new infrastructure capabilities required for\nalternative modes of transportation such as autonomous\nvehicles), and water infrastructure (with an emphasis on\nwater conversion and increasing the water supply), and (ii)\nthe S&P Kensho Smart Buildings Index focused on intelligent\nand connected home technologies and building automation\ninfrastructure (the \u201cUnderlying Indexes\u201d) as of the Index's\nreconstitution reference date. The Underlying Indexes are\nsubject to the following liquidity thresholds for each\ncomponent: (i) must have a share price of at least USD\n$1.00; (ii) must be issued by a company with a minimum\nfloat market capitalization of at least $100 million; and\n(iii) must have a minimum three-month average daily traded\nvalue of at least $1 million. The S&P Kensho Smart Grids\nIndex seeks to track companies that provide next generation\nproducts and services related to power, water and\ntransportation infrastructures, or are a necessary\ncomponent of the supply chain for such products and\nservices. The S&P Kensho Smart Buildings Index seeks to\ntrack companies that produce products and services that\nenable buildings to become more connected, intelligent and\nadaptive, or are a necessary component of the supply chain\nfor such products and services. To determine the\nconstituents of the Underlying Indexes, the Index\nProvider's classification standard utilizes an automated\nscan of companies' most recent regulatory filings with the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K, Form\n20-F, Form 40-F, or Form S-1, as applicable, maintained in\nthe S&P Market Intelligence United Document Repository, to\nidentify specific search terms and phrases that describe a\ncompany as producing products and services related to the\nparticular segment targeted by the Underlying Index. The\nresulting list of eligible securities for each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered by eliminating companies that do not\ninclude in their regulatory filings a reference to a\nproduct or service that (i) is related to a search term or\nphrase and (ii) is used in a manner that is within the\nscope of the Underlying Index's objective. Each Underlying\nIndex then screens the remaining securities to remove\nsecurities that are not listed on NYSE, NASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an affiliate of one of those exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain minimum liquidity thresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index Committee then reviews each remaining\neligible constituent to verify the rules of the automated\nscan were implemented correctly. Underlying Index\nconstituents are then categorized as either \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is categorized as Core if its products and\nservices related to the Underlying Index's objective are\nidentified in its regulatory filings as principal\ncomponents of the company's strategy. Products and services\nare deemed to be principal components of a company's\nstrategy if the company's regulatory filing disclosures\nregarding such products and services are determined to be\nsufficiently prominent according to a proprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider which calculates prominence based on\nthe frequency and position of such disclosures within\nregulatory filings. A company may also be categorized as\nCore if the Index Provider determines that the majority of\nthe company's revenue is derived from products and services\nrelated to the Underlying Index's objective as indicated by\nthe company's reported business segments, which is assessed\nby scanning the S&P Capital IQ Database for annual fiscal\nyear revenue segment reporting. All other companies are\ncategorized as Non-Core, including companies whose products\nand services are identified as forming a necessary\ncomponent of the supply chain of the segment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index. An Index constituent categorized as\nCore by at least one of the Underlying Indexes will be\ncategorized as Core for purposes of the Index. To tilt the\nIndex's exposure toward Core Index Constituents, at the\ntime of each rebalance the aggregate weighting of Core\nIndex Constituents is based on the proportion of the number\nof Core Index Constituents, plus an overweight factor of up\nto 20%. At the time of each rebalance, each Core Index\nConstituent and Non-Core Index Constituent is equally\nweighted within the group of Core Index Constituents and\nNon-Core Index Constituents, respectively, subject to\nliquidity and diversification adjustments. The Index is\nreconstituted and rebalanced after the close of trading on\nthe third Friday in June with a reference date as of the\nclose of the last trading day in May. In addition, the\nIndex is rebalanced after the close of trading on the third\nFriday of December with a reference date as of the close of\nthe last trading day in November. In connection with the\nDecember rebalance, Index constituents are also evaluated\nfor continued inclusion in the Index if a new eligible\nregulatory filing has been filed since the last\nreconstitution review. As of July 31, 2024, the Index\ncomprised 49 securities. The Index Provider is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\nestablishes and maintains rules which are used to determine\nthe composition of the Index and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index.\n\n190\n\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nInfrastructure-Related Companies Risk: Infrastructure-\nrelated companies include companies that primarily own,\nmanage, develop and/or operate infrastructure assets,\nincluding transportation, utility, energy and/or\ntelecommunications assets. Investment in infrastructure-\nrelated securities entails exposure to adverse economic,\nregulatory, political, legal, and other conditions or\nevents affecting the issuers of such securities. Certain\ninfrastructure-related entities, particularly\ntelecommunications and utilities companies, are subject to\nextensive regulation by various governmental authorities.\nThe costs of complying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals\nor the enactment of new adverse regulatory requirements may\nadversely affect infrastructure-related companies.\nInfrastructure-related companies may also be affected by\nservice interruption and/or legal challenges due to\nenvironmental, operational or other conditions or events,\nand the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax\nlaws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.\nCybersecurity-Related Risk: The companies included in the\nIndex rely on technologies such as the Internet and depend\non computer systems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, and therefore may be prone to operational and\ninformation security risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. Cyber-attacks include,\namong others, stealing or corrupting data maintained online\nor digitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing\ninformation or services on a website, releasing\nconfidential information without authorization, and causing\noperational disruption. In general, cyber-attacks are\ndeliberate, but unintentional events may have similar\neffects. Successful cyber-attacks against, or security\nbreakdowns of, a company included in the Index may result\nin material adverse consequences for such company, as well\nas other companies included in the Index, and may cause the\nFund's investments to lose value. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments in a particular industry or sector,\nfinancial, economic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic\nsector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it\nhad not done so. Depositary Receipts Risk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying securities in their primary trading\nmarket. If a depositary receipt is denominated in a\ndifferent currency than its underlying securities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the currency risk of both the investment\nin the depositary receipt and the underlying security.\nHolders of depositary receipts may have limited or no\nrights to take action with respect to the underlying\nsecurities or to compel the issuer of the receipts to take\naction. The prices of depositary receipts may differ from\nthe prices of securities upon which they are based. To the\nextent the Fund invests in depositary receipts based on\nsecurities included in the Index, such differences in\nprices may increase index tracking risk.\n\n191\n\nEmerging Markets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging\nmarkets include, among others, greater political and\neconomic instability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities markets,\nincreased potential for market manipulation, possible trade\nbarriers, currency transfer restrictions, a more limited\nnumber of potential buyers and issuers, an emerging market\ncountry's dependence on revenue from particular commodities\nor international aid, less governmental supervision and\nregulation, unavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial reporting standards,\nand less developed legal systems. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The securities\nof emerging market companies may trade less frequently and\nin smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections may limit\nvery significantly the liquidity of securities of certain\ncompanies in a particular country or geographic region, or\nof all companies in the country or region. The Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any\ntime, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts\n\n192\n\nto control the U.S. (and other) government budgets.\nTransportation securities, another component of the\nindustrial sector, are cyclical and have occasional sharp\nprice movements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and insurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization Securities Risk: Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail\nthe returns on investments in securities of smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Larger companies may be unable to\nrespond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in business, product,\nfinancial, or other market conditions. Larger companies may\nnot be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed\nmarket conditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the\nability of the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous\ntime or price or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at\na discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may\nbe subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the\nFund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling\nsuch investments, may be unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization Securities Risk: The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a\nforeign currency, there are special risks such as changes\nin currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Investments in\ndepositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of smaller companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may have\nsignificant volatility. The Fund may be unable to liquidate\nits positions in such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations.\nReturns on investments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger companies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or economic factors impacting\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both domestically\nand internationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Stocks\n\n193\n\nof technology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Technology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nValuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to\nvalue a portfolio holding when market quotations are not\nreadily available. The value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from what would be\nproduced using a different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are\nvalued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the\nnext than if market quotations were used. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out\na portfolio position for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a\nloss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at\na discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table\nprovide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund\nby showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns\nfor certain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Mark Krivitsky is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group and the Tax-Efficient Market Capture Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 1996. Kala O'Donnell is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 1995. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national\nsecurities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k)\nplan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be\ntaxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services\nrelated to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another\ninvestment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n195\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Kensho New Economies Composite ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Kensho New Economies Composite ETF    \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment           \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses, correspond  \n  generally to the total return performance of the   \n  S&P KenshoNew Economies Composite Index.           \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.20%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.20%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 59 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nKensho New Economies Composite Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n196\n\nThe Index is comprised of U.S.-listed equity securities\n(including depositary receipts) of companies domiciled\nacross developed and emerging markets worldwide. The Index\nis designed to capture companies whose products and\nservices are driving innovation and transforming the global\neconomy through the use of existing and emerging\ntechnologies, and rapid developments in robotics,\nautomation, artificial intelligence, connectedness and\nprocessing power (\u201cNew Economies companies\u201d). In\nparticular, the Index comprises the components included in\nthe New Economy Subsector Indexes (each, an \u201cUnderlying\nIndex\u201d) developed by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d). Each Underlying Index is comprised of\nsecurities of New Economies companies in a specific sector.\nAs of July 31, 2024, the Index was comprised of 25\nUnderlying Indexes. The constituents of each Underlying\nIndex are determined by a classification standard produced\nby the Index Provider. The classification standard utilizes\nan automated scan of companies' most recent regulatory\nfilings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on\nForm 10-K, Form 20-F, Form 40-F, or Form S-1 filing, as\napplicable, maintained in the S&P Market Intelligence\nUnited Document Repository, to identify specific search\nterms and phrases that describe a company as producing\nproducts and services related to the particular segment\ntargeted by the Underlying Index. The resulting list of\neligible securities for each Underlying Index is then\nfiltered by eliminating companies that do not include in\ntheir regulatory filings a reference to a product or\nservice that (i) is related to a search term or phrase and\n(ii) is used in a manner that is within the scope of the\nUnderlying Index's objective. Each Underlying Index then\nscreens the remaining securities to remove securities that\nare not listed on NYSE, NASDAQ, or CBOE exchanges (or an\naffiliate of one of those exchanges) or do not meet certain\nminimum liquidity thresholds. The Index Provider's Index\nCommittee then reviews each remaining eligible constituent\nto verify the rules of the automated scan were implemented\ncorrectly. Underlying Index constituents are then\ncategorized as either \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-Core.\u201d A company is\ncategorized as Core if its products and services related to\nthe Underlying Index's objective are identified in its\nregulatory filings as principal components of the company's\nstrategy. Products and services are deemed to be principal\ncomponents of a company's strategy if the company's\nregulatory filing disclosures regarding such products and\nservices are determined to be sufficiently prominent\naccording to a proprietary algorithm of the Index Provider\nwhich calculates prominence based on the frequency and\nposition of such disclosures within regulatory filings. A\ncompany may also be categorized as Core if the Index\nProvider determines that the majority of the company's\nrevenue is derived from products and services related to\nthe Underlying Index's objective as indicated by the\ncompany's reported business segments, which is assessed by\nscanning the S&P Capital IQ Database for annual fiscal year\nrevenue segment reporting. All other companies are\ncategorized as Non-Core, including companies whose products\nand services are identified as forming a necessary\ncomponent of the supply chain of the segment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index. Each Underlying Index's exposure is\nthen tilted towards Core Index Constituents. The weight of\neach security in the Index is based on the relative weight\ngiven to each Underlying Index in the Index. The relative\nweight of each Underlying Index is determined by a\nproprietary process comparing the ratio of the average\ndaily returns divided by the standard deviation of daily\nreturns among the Underlying Indexes. Underlying Indexes\nwith larger ratios are weighted more heavily than\nUnderlying Indexes with smaller ratios. The weight of each\nsecurity in each Underlying Index is then multiplied by the\nrelative weight of the respective Underlying Index in the\nIndex to determine the security's initial weight in the\nIndex. The final constituent security weight is subject to\nliquidity and diversification adjustments. The Index is\nreconstituted and rebalanced after the close of trading on\nthe third Friday in June with a reference date as of the\nclose of the last trading day in May. In addition, the\nIndex is rebalanced after the close of trading on the third\nFriday of December with a reference date as of the close of\nthe last trading day in November. In connection with the\nDecember rebalance, Index constituents are also evaluated\nfor continued inclusion in the Index if a new eligible\nregulatory filing has been filed since the last\nreconstitution review. As of July 31, 2024, the Index\ncomprised 437 securities. The Index Provider is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\nestablishes and maintains rules which are used to determine\nthe composition of the Index and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all investments, there are certain risks\nof investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value,\nand you could lose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth\n\n197\n\nor recession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes\nin the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time. New\nEconomies Companies Risk: The companies included in the\nIndex are engaged in emerging industries and new\ntechnologies that may be unproven. Such industries and\ntechnologies may be adversely affected by technological\nadvances, competition, rapid product or service\nobsolescence, and new and evolving regulations. Companies\nincluded in the Index may rely on a combination of patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish\nand protect their proprietary rights in their products and\ntechnologies, and may be adversely affected by loss or\nimpairment of those rights. In addition, companies in the\nIndex may have limited product lines, markets, financial\nresources or personnel. The Index may include stocks of\nsmaller, less-seasoned companies that may be more volatile\nthan the overall market. Cybersecurity-Related Risk: The\ncompanies included in the Index rely on technologies such\nas the Internet and depend on computer systems to perform\nbusiness and operational functions, and therefore may be\nprone to operational and information security risks\nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or technological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or digitally,\npreventing legitimate users from accessing information or\nservices on a website, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, and causing operational disruption.\nIn general, cyber-attacks are deliberate, but unintentional\nevents may have similar effects. Successful cyber-attacks\nagainst, or security breakdowns of, a company included in\nthe Index may result in material adverse consequences for\nsuch company, as well as other companies included in the\nIndex, and may cause the Fund's investments to lose value.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Depositary\nReceipts Risk: Investments in depositary receipts may be\nless liquid and more volatile than the underlying\nsecurities in their primary trading market. If a depositary\nreceipt is denominated in a different currency than its\nunderlying securities, the Fund will be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both the investment in the depositary\nreceipt and the underlying security. Holders of depositary\nreceipts may have limited or no rights to take action with\nrespect to the underlying securities or to compel the\nissuer of the receipts to take action. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may differ from the prices of\nsecurities upon which they are based. To the extent the\nFund invests in depositary receipts based on securities\nincluded in the Index, such differences in prices may\nincrease index tracking risk. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks\nof investing in emerging markets include, among others,\ngreater political and economic instability, greater\nvolatility in currency exchange rates, less developed\nsecurities markets, increased potential for market\nmanipulation, possible trade barriers, currency transfer\nrestrictions, a more limited number of potential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging market country's dependence on revenue\nfrom particular commodities or international aid, less\ngovernmental supervision and regulation, unavailability of\ncurrency hedging techniques, differences in auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards, and less developed legal\nsystems. There is also the potential for unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation, nationalization, embargo, and acts\nof war. The securities of emerging market companies may\ntrade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial\nmarket corrections may limit very significantly the\nliquidity of securities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of all\ncompanies in the country or region. The Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its positions in such securities at any time,\nor at a favorable price, in order to meet the\n\n198\n\nFund's obligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Health\nCare Sector Risk: Companies in the health care sector are\nsubject to extensive government regulation and their\nprofitability can be significantly affected by restrictions\non government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising\ncosts of medical products and services, pricing pressure\n(including price discounting), limited product lines and an\nincreased emphasis on the delivery of healthcare through\noutpatient services. Companies in the health care sector\nare heavily dependent on obtaining and defending patents,\nwhich may be time consuming and costly, and the expiration\nof patents may also adversely affect the profitability of\nthese companies. Health care companies are also subject to\nextensive litigation based on product liability and similar\nclaims. In addition, their products can become obsolete due\nto industry innovation, changes in technologies or other\nmarket developments. Many new products in the health care\nsector require significant research and development and may\nbe subject to regulatory approvals, all of which may be\ntime consuming and costly with no guarantee that any\nproduct will come to market. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the performance of\nan unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current\nor projected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts\n\n199\n\nto control the U.S. (and other) government budgets.\nTransportation securities, another component of the\nindustrial sector, are cyclical and have occasional sharp\nprice movements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and insurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization Securities Risk: Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail\nthe returns on investments in securities of smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Larger companies may be unable to\nrespond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in business, product,\nfinancial, or other market conditions. Larger companies may\nnot be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed\nmarket conditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the\nability of the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous\ntime or price or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at\na discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may\nbe subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the\nFund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling\nsuch investments, may be unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization Securities Risk: The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a\nforeign currency, there are special risks such as changes\nin currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Investments in\ndepositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of smaller companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may have\nsignificant volatility. The Fund may be unable to liquidate\nits positions in such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations.\nReturns on investments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger companies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or economic factors impacting\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both domestically\nand internationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Stocks\n\n200\n\nof technology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Technology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nValuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to\nvalue a portfolio holding when market quotations are not\nreadily available. The value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from what would be\nproduced using a different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are\nvalued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the\nnext than if market quotations were used. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out\na portfolio position for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a\nloss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at\na discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table\nprovide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund\nby showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns\nfor certain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Mark Krivitsky is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group and the Tax-Efficient Market Capture Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 1996. Kala O'Donnell is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 1995. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national\nsecurities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k)\nplan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be\ntaxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services\nrelated to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another\ninvestment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n202\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (the        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the total return performance of the S&P Kensho     \n  SmartTransportation Index.                         \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.45%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 44 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nKensho Smart Transportation Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n203\n\nThe Index is comprised of U.S.-listed equity securities\n(including depositary receipts) of companies domiciled\nacross developed and emerging markets worldwide which are\nincluded in the Smart Transportation sector as determined\nby a classification standard produced by S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The Index is designed\nto capture companies whose products and services are\ndriving innovation behind smart transportation. In\nparticular, the Index comprises the components of the S&P\nKensho Autonomous Vehicles Index, the S&P Kensho Advanced\nTransport Systems Index, the S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles\nIndex and the civilian/commercially focused components of\nthe S&P Kensho Drones Index (the \u201cUnderlying Indexes\u201d) as\nof the Index's reconstitution reference date. The\nUnderlying Indexes are subject to the following liquidity\nthresholds for each component: (i) must have a share price\nof at least USD $1.00; (ii) must be issued by a company\nwith a minimum float market capitalization of at least $100\nmillion; and (iii) must have a minimum three-month average\ndaily traded value of at least $1 million. The S&P Kensho\nAutonomous Vehicles Index seeks to track companies that\nbuild autonomous and connected vehicles and that provide\nthe products and services that enable these vehicles to\nbecome more efficient and intelligent, or are a necessary\ncomponent of the supply chain for such products and\nservices. The S&P Kensho Advanced Transport Systems Index\nseeks to track companies that produce products and services\nthat optimize the efficiency of managing large fleets of\nvehicles, cargo transportation, and mass transit, or are a\nnecessary component of the supply chain for such products\nand services. The S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles Index seeks\nto track companies that produce products and services\nrelated to the development of electric vehicles, clean fuel\nsystems, and related systems, or are a necessary component\nof the supply chain for such products and services. The S&P\nKensho Drones Index seeks to track companies that produce\nproducts and services related to the remotely-operated or\nunmanned aerial, underwater and surface-level drones market\nand related subsystems, or are a necessary component of the\nsupply chain for such products and services. To determine\nthe constituents of the Underlying Indexes, the Index\nProvider's classification standard utilizes an automated\nscan of companies' most recent regulatory filings with the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K, Form\n20-F, Form 40-F, or Form S-1, as applicable, maintained in\nthe S&P Market Intelligence United Document Repository, to\nidentify specific search terms and phrases that describe a\ncompany as producing products and services related to the\nparticular segment targeted by the Underlying Index. The\nresulting list of eligible securities for each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered by eliminating companies that do not\ninclude in their regulatory filings a reference to a\nproduct or service that (i) is related to a search term or\nphrase and (ii) is used in a manner that is within the\nscope of the Underlying Index's objective. Each Underlying\nIndex then screens the remaining securities to remove\nsecurities that are not listed on NYSE, NASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an affiliate of one of those exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain minimum liquidity thresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index Committee then reviews each remaining\neligible constituent to verify the rules of the automated\nscan were implemented correctly. Underlying Index\nconstituents are then categorized as either \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is categorized as Core if its products and\nservices related to the Underlying Index's objective are\nidentified in its regulatory filings as principal\ncomponents of the company's strategy. Products and services\nare deemed to be principal components of a company's\nstrategy if the company's regulatory filing disclosures\nregarding such products and services are determined to be\nsufficiently prominent according to a proprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider which calculates prominence based on\nthe frequency and position of such disclosures within\nregulatory filings. A company may also be categorized as\nCore if the Index Provider determines that the majority of\nthe company's revenue is derived from products and services\nrelated to the Underlying Index's objective as indicated by\nthe company's reported business segments, which is assessed\nby scanning the S&P Capital IQ Database for annual fiscal\nyear revenue segment reporting. All other companies are\ncategorized as Non-Core, including companies whose products\nand services are identified as forming a necessary\ncomponent of the supply chain of the segment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index. An Index constituent categorized as\nCore by at least one of the Underlying Indexes will be\ncategorized as Core for purposes of the Index. To tilt the\nIndex's exposure toward Core Index Constituents, at the\ntime of each rebalance the aggregate weighting of Core\nIndex Constituents is based on the proportion of the number\nof Core Index Constituents, plus an overweight factor of up\nto 20%. At the time of each rebalance, each Core Index\nConstituent and Non-Core Index Constituent is equally\nweighted within the group of Core Index Constituents and\nNon-Core Index Constituents, respectively, subject to\nliquidity adjustments. The Index is reconstituted and\nrebalanced after the close of trading on the third Friday\nin June with a reference date as of the close of the last\ntrading day in May. In addition, the Index is rebalanced\nafter the close of trading on the third Friday of December\nwith a reference date as of the close of the last trading\nday in November. In connection with the December rebalance,\nIndex constituents are also evaluated for continued\ninclusion in the Index if a new eligible regulatory filing\nhas been filed since the last reconstitution review. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, the Index comprised 71 securities.\n\n204\n\nThe Index Provider is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider establishes and maintains rules\nwhich are used to determine the composition of the Index\nand relative weightings of the securities in the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nTransportation Companies Risk: Transportation companies can\nbe significantly affected by changes in the economy, fuel\nprices, labor relations, technology developments, exchange\nrates, insurance costs, industry competition and government\nregulation. Cybersecurity-Related Risk: The companies\nincluded in the Index rely on technologies such as the\nInternet and depend on computer systems to perform business\nand operational functions, and therefore may be prone to\noperational and information security risks resulting from\ncyber-attacks and/or technological malfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among others, stealing or corrupting data\nmaintained online or digitally, preventing legitimate users\nfrom accessing information or services on a website,\nreleasing confidential information without authorization,\nand causing operational disruption. In general, cyber-\nattacks are deliberate, but unintentional events may have\nsimilar effects. Successful cyber-attacks against, or\nsecurity breakdowns of, a company included in the Index may\nresult in material adverse consequences for such company,\nas well as other companies included in the Index, and may\ncause the Fund's investments to lose value. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and\nsold in the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments in a particular industry or sector,\nfinancial, economic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic\nsector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it\nhad not done so. Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is\ntied closely to the performance of the overall global\neconomy, interest rates, competition and consumer\nconfidence. Success depends heavily on disposable household\nincome and consumer spending. Also, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary sector may be subject to severe\ncompetition, which may have an adverse impact on their\nrespective profitability. Changes in demographics and\nconsumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and success\nof, consumer products and services in the marketplace.\nDepositary Receipts Risk: Investments in depositary\nreceipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the\nunderlying securities in their primary trading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is denominated in a different currency\nthan its underlying securities, the Fund will be subject to\nthe currency risk of both the investment in the depositary\nreceipt and the underlying security. Holders of depositary\nreceipts may have limited or no rights to take action with\nrespect to the underlying securities or to compel the\nissuer of the receipts to take action. The prices of\ndepositary\n\n205\n\nreceipts may differ from the prices of securities upon\nwhich they are based. To the extent the Fund invests in\ndepositary receipts based on securities included in the\nIndex, such differences in prices may increase index\ntracking risk. Emerging Markets Risk: Risks of investing in\nemerging markets include, among others, greater political\nand economic instability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities markets,\nincreased potential for market manipulation, possible trade\nbarriers, currency transfer restrictions, a more limited\nnumber of potential buyers and issuers, an emerging market\ncountry's dependence on revenue from particular commodities\nor international aid, less governmental supervision and\nregulation, unavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial reporting standards,\nand less developed legal systems. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The securities\nof emerging market companies may trade less frequently and\nin smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections may limit\nvery significantly the liquidity of securities of certain\ncompanies in a particular country or geographic region, or\nof all companies in the country or region. The Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any\ntime, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their\n\n206\n\nproducts and services. Thus, the financial condition of,\nand investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies\nare heavily influenced by governmental defense spending\npolicies which are typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol the U.S. (and other) government budgets.\nTransportation securities, another component of the\nindustrial sector, are cyclical and have occasional sharp\nprice movements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and insurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization Securities Risk: Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail\nthe returns on investments in securities of smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Larger companies may be unable to\nrespond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in business, product,\nfinancial, or other market conditions. Larger companies may\nnot be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed\nmarket conditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the\nability of the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous\ntime or price or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at\na discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may\nbe subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the\nFund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling\nsuch investments, may be unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization Securities Risk: The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities\n(including depositary receipts) are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent that the Fund buys securities denominated in a\nforeign currency, there are special risks such as changes\nin currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign\ngovernment could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Investments in\ndepositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may\ninvolve more risk than the securities of larger companies.\nThese companies may have limited product lines, markets or\nfinancial resources, may lack the competitive strength of\nlarger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of smaller companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may have\nsignificant volatility. The Fund may be unable to liquidate\nits positions in such securities at any time, or at a\nfavorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations.\nReturns on investments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger companies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or economic factors impacting\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid\n\n207\n\nchanges in technology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, including competition\nfrom foreign competitors with lower production costs.\nStocks of technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are heavily dependent\non patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nValuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to\nvalue a portfolio holding when market quotations are not\nreadily available. The value established for any portfolio\nholding at a point in time might differ from what would be\nproduced using a different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are\nvalued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the\nnext than if market quotations were used. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out\na portfolio position for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a\nloss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at\na discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table\nprovide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund\nby showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns\nfor certain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Mark Krivitsky is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group and the Tax-Efficient Market Capture Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 1996. Kathleen Morgan, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in\nthe Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other\nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions\nare conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national\nsecurities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k)\nplan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be\ntaxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services\nrelated to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another\ninvestment.

Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 43 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nMetals & Mining Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n210\n\nThe Index represents the metals and mining segment of the\nS&P Total Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed\nto track the broad U.S. equity market. The metals & mining\nsegment of the S&P TMI comprises the following sub-\nindustries: Aluminum, Coal & Consumable Fuels, Copper,\nDiversified Metals & Mining, Gold, Precious Metals &\nMinerals, Silver, and Steel. The Index is one of twenty-one\n(21) of the S&P Select Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d), each designed to measure the\nperformance of a narrow sub-industry or group of sub-\nindustries determined based on the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select\nIndustry Indices is based on the GICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and market cap requirements. Companies in\nthe Select Industry Indices are classified according to\nGICS which determines classifications primarily based on\nrevenues; however, earnings and market perception are also\nconsidered. The Index consists of the S&P TMI constituents\nbelonging to the Aluminum, Coal & Consumable Fuels, Copper,\nDiversified Metals & Mining, Gold, Precious Metals &\nMinerals, Silver, and Steel sub-industries that satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater than or equal to $500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted liquidity ratio (defined by dollar value\ntraded over the previous 12 months divided by the float-\nadjusted market capitalization as of the index rebalancing\nreference date) greater than or equal to 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization greater than or equal\nto $400 million with a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are\nU.S. based companies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for initial public offerings or spin-offs that\ndo not have 12 months of trading history is annualized. The\nmarket capitalization threshold may be relaxed to ensure\nthat there are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month. The S&P TMI tracks\nall eligible U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 36 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nMetals and Mining Companies Risk: Metals and mining\ncompanies can be significantly affected by events relating\nto international political and economic developments,\nenergy conservation, the success of exploration projects,\ncommodity prices, and tax and other government regulations.\nInvestments in metals and mining companies may be\nspeculative and may be subject to greater price volatility\nthan investments in other types of companies. Risks of\nmetals and mining investments include: changes in\ninternational monetary policies or economic and political\nconditions that can affect the supply of precious metals\nand consequently the value of metals and mining company\ninvestments; the United States or foreign governments may\npass laws or regulations limiting metals investments for\nstrategic or other policy reasons; and increased\nenvironmental or labor costs may depress the value of\nmetals and mining investments.\n\n211\n\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Materials Sector Risk: Many\nmaterials companies are significantly affected by the level\nand volatility of commodity prices, exchange rates, import\ncontrols, worldwide competition, environmental policies and\nconsumer demand. At times, worldwide production of\nindustrial materials has exceeded demand as a result of\nover-building or economic downturns, leading to poor\ninvestment returns or losses. Other risks may include\nliabilities for environmental damage and general civil\nliabilities, depletion of resources, and mandated\nexpenditures for safety and pollution control. The\nmaterials sector may also be affected by economic cycles,\ntechnical progress, labor relations, and government\nregulations. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of\nportfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent\nthe Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular security held\nby the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested\nin a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may\nbe more volatile than the values of shares of more\ndiversified funds. The Fund may become diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of tracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities).\n\n212\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of\nthe Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Raymond Donofrio is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2008. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n213\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment.

The Index consists of the S&P TMI constituents\nbelonging to the Oil & Gas Drilling sub-industry and the\nOil & Gas Equipment & Services sub-industry that satisfy\nthe following criteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater than or equal to $500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted liquidity ratio (defined by dollar value\ntraded over the previous 12 months divided by the float-\nadjusted market capitalization as of the index rebalancing\nreference date) greater than or equal to 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization greater than or equal\nto $400 million with a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are\nU.S. based companies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for initial public offerings or spin-offs that\ndo not have 12 months of trading history is annualized. The\nmarket capitalization threshold may be relaxed to ensure\nthat there are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month. The S&P TMI tracks\nall eligible U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 31 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time. Oil\nand Gas Companies Risk: Oil and gas companies develop and\nproduce crude oil and natural gas and provide drilling and\nother energy resources production and distribution related\nservices. Stock prices for these types of companies are\naffected by supply and demand both for their specific\nproduct or service and for energy products in general. The\nprice of oil and gas, exploration and production spending,\ngovernment regulation, world events and economic conditions\nwill likewise affect the performance of these companies.\nCorrespondingly, securities of companies in the energy\nfield are subject to swift price and supply fluctuations\ncaused by events relating to international politics, energy\nconservation, the success of exploration projects, and tax\nand other governmental regulatory policies. Weak demand for\nthe companies' products or services or for energy products\nand services in general, as well as negative developments\nin these other areas, would adversely impact the Fund's\nperformance.\n\n216\n\nOil and gas equipment and services can be significantly\naffected by natural disasters as well as changes in\nexchange rates, interest rates, government regulation,\nworld events and economic conditions. These companies may\nbe at risk for environmental damage claims. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and\nsold in the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments in a particular industry or sector,\nfinancial, economic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic\nsector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it\nhad not done so. Energy Sector Risk: Issuers in energy-\nrelated industries can be significantly affected by\nfluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of\nenergy fuels. Markets for various energy-related\ncommodities can have significant volatility, and are\nsubject to control or manipulation by large producers or\npurchasers. Companies in the energy sector may need to make\nsubstantial expenditures, and to incur significant amounts\nof debt, in order to maintain or expand their reserves. Oil\nand gas exploration and production can be significantly\naffected by natural disasters as well as changes in\nexchange rates, interest rates, government regulation,\nworld events and economic conditions. These companies may\nbe at risk for environmental damage claims. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n217\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider, Thomas Coleman and Xianhang Wu. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and\nCo-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Thomas Coleman,\nCFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1998. Xianhang Wu is an Assistant Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio\nManager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the Adviser in 2016. Purchase and Sale Information\nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or\nother broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.\n\n218\n\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund\nShares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to\naccept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n219\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P \u00ae Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production    \n  ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment       \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses, correspond  \n  generally to the total return performance of an    \n  index derivedfrom the oil and gas exploration and  \n  production segment of a U.S. total market          \n  composite index.                                   \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 36 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P Oil\n& Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the\nIndex in approximately the same proportions as the Index,\nas determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n220\n\nThe Index represents the oil and gas exploration and\nproduction segment of the S&P Total Market Index (\u201cS&P\nTMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to track the broad U.S.\nequity market. The oil and gas exploration and production\nsegment of the S&P TMI comprises the following sub-\nindustries: Integrated Oil & Gas, Oil & Gas Exploration &\nProduction, and Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing. The Index\nis one of twenty-one (21) of the S&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d), each designed to\nmeasure the performance of a narrow sub-industry or group\nof sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select\nIndustry Indices is based on the GICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and market cap requirements. Companies in\nthe Select Industry Indices are classified according to\nGICS which determines classifications primarily based on\nrevenues; however, earnings and market perception are also\nconsidered. The Index consists of the S&P TMI constituents\nbelonging to the Integrated Oil & Gas, Oil & Gas\nExploration & Production, and Oil & Gas Refining &\nMarketing sub-industries that satisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market capitalization\ngreater than or equal to $500 million with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of the index rebalancing reference date)\ngreater than or equal to 90% or have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to $400 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as defined above)\ngreater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar value traded\nfor initial public offerings or spin-offs that do not have\n12 months of trading history is annualized. The market\ncapitalization threshold may be relaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month.

The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n222\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Olga Winner. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Olga Winner, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2007. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n223\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n224\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P \u00ae Pharmaceuticals ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)      \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before   \n  fees andexpenses, correspond generally to the      \n  total return performance of an index derived from  \n  thepharmaceuticals segment of a U.S. total market  \n  composite index.                                   \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 61 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nPharmaceuticals Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n225\n\nThe Index represents the pharmaceuticals segment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S. equity market. The pharmaceuticals\nsegment of the S&P TMI comprises the Pharmaceuticals sub-\nindustry. The Index is one of twenty-one (21) of the S&P\nSelect Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to measure the performance of a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of sub-industries determined based on the\nGlobal Industry Classification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the Select Industry Indices is based on the\nGICS classification, as well as liquidity and market cap\nrequirements. Companies in the Select Industry Indices are\nclassified according to GICS which determines\nclassifications primarily based on revenues; however,\nearnings and market perception are also considered. The\nIndex consists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging to the\nPharmaceuticals sub-industry that satisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market capitalization\ngreater than or equal to $500 million with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of the index rebalancing reference date)\ngreater than or equal to 90% or have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to $400 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as defined above)\ngreater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar value traded\nfor initial public offerings or spin-offs that do not have\n12 months of trading history is annualized. The market\ncapitalization threshold may be relaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month. The S&P TMI tracks\nall eligible U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 43 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nPharmaceuticals Companies Risk: Pharmaceutical companies\nare heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration\nof patents may adversely affect the profitability of the\ncompanies. Pharmaceutical companies are also subject to\nextensive litigation based on product liability and other\nsimilar claims. Many new products are subject to approval\nof the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The\nprocess of obtaining FDA approval can be long and costly\nand approved products are susceptible to obsolescence.\nPharmaceutical companies are also subject to heavy\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult to raise\nprices and, in fact, may result in price discounting.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times\n\n226\n\nwhen the market price of the shares is more than the net\nasset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is heightened in\ntimes of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments affecting\nissuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will\nhave a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not done\nso. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the purchase or sale\nof a specific asset at a specific price at a specific\nfuture time, or cash settlement of the terms of the\ncontract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Health Care Sector Risk: Companies\nin the health care sector are subject to extensive\ngovernment regulation and their profitability can be\nsignificantly affected by restrictions on government\nreimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical\nproducts and services, pricing pressure (including price\ndiscounting), limited product lines and an increased\nemphasis on the delivery of healthcare through outpatient\nservices. Companies in the health care sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining and defending patents, which may be\ntime consuming and costly, and the expiration of patents\nmay also adversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. Health care companies are also subject to\nextensive litigation based on product liability and similar\nclaims. In addition, their products can become obsolete due\nto industry innovation, changes in technologies or other\nmarket developments. Many new products in the health care\nsector require significant research and development and may\nbe subject to regulatory approvals, all of which may be\ntime consuming and costly with no guarantee that any\nproduct will come to market. Indexing Strategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the performance of\nan unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current\nor projected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Keith Richardson is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 1999. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n228\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n229\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Regional Banking ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)     \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before   \n  feesand expenses, correspond generally to the      \n  total return performance of an index derived from  \n  the regionalbanking segment of the U.S. banking    \n  industry.                                          \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 51 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nRegional Banks Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n230\n\nThe Index represents the regional banks segment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S. equity market. The regional banks\nsegment of the S&P TMI comprises the Regional Banks sub-\nindustry. The Index is one of twenty-one (21) of the S&P\nSelect Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to measure the performance of a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of sub-industries determined based on the\nGlobal Industry Classification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the Select Industry Indices is based on the\nGICS classification, as well as liquidity and market cap\nrequirements. Companies in the Select Industry Indices are\nclassified according to GICS which determines\nclassifications primarily based on revenues; however,\nearnings and market perception are also considered. The\nIndex consists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging to the\nRegional Banks sub-industry that satisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market capitalization\ngreater than or equal to $500 million with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of the index rebalancing reference date)\ngreater than or equal to 90% or have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to $400 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as defined above)\ngreater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar value traded\nfor initial public offerings or spin-offs that do not have\n12 months of trading history is annualized. The market\ncapitalization threshold may be relaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month. The S&P TMI tracks\nall eligible U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 141 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nBanking Companies Risk: The performance of bank stocks may\nbe affected by extensive governmental regulation, which may\nlimit the amounts and types of loans and other financial\ncommitments they can make, the interest rates and fees they\ncan charge, and the amount of capital they must maintain.\nThe impact of changes in regulations and capital\nrequirements on a banking company cannot be predicted and\nmay negatively impact such banking company. Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when\ninterest rates change. Credit losses resulting from\nfinancial difficulties of borrowers can negatively impact\nbanking companies. Banks may also be subject to severe\nprice competition. Competition among banking companies is\nhigh and failure to maintain or increase market share may\nresult in lost market value. Regional Bank Risk:\nInvestments in regional banks, which may be small or medium\nin size, may involve greater risk than investing in larger,\nmore established banks. Securities of regional banks are\noften less liquid and subject to greater volatility and\nless trading volume than is customarily associated with\nsecurities of larger\n\n231\n\nbanks. A regional bank's financial performance may be\ndependent upon the business environment in certain\ngeographic regions of the United States and, as a result,\nadverse economic or employment developments in such regions\nmay negatively impact such regional bank and, in turn, the\nFund. Financial Institutions Risk: Changes in the\ncreditworthiness of financial institutions (such as banks\nand broker-dealers) may adversely affect the values of\ninstruments of issuers in financial industries. Adverse\ndevelopments in banking and other financial industries may\ncause the Fund to underperform relative to other funds that\ninvest more broadly across different industries or have a\nsmaller exposure to financial institutions. In the Spring\nof 2023, the shut\u2010down of certain financial institutions\nraised economic concerns over disruption in the U.S.\nbanking system. There can be no certainty that the actions\ntaken by the U.S. government to strengthen public\nconfidence in the U.S. banking system will be effective in\nmitigating the effects of financial institution failures on\nthe economy and restoring public confidence in the U.S.\nbanking system. Other adverse developments that affect\nfinancial institutions or the financial services industry\ngenerally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these\nkinds or other similar risks, may reduce liquidity in the\nmarket generally or have other adverse effects on the\neconomy or the Fund. In addition, the Fund may not be able\nto identify all potential solvency or stress concerns with\nrespect to a financial institution or to transfer assets\nfrom one bank or financial institution to another in a\ntimely manner in the event such bank or financial\ninstitution comes under stress or fails. Changes in\ngovernmental regulation and oversight of financial\ninstitutions may have an adverse effect on the financial\ncondition of a financial institution. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments in a particular industry or sector,\nfinancial, economic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic\nsector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it\nhad not done so. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract\nis a standardized agreement that calls for the purchase or\nsale of a specific asset at a specific price at a specific\nfuture time, or cash settlement of the terms of the\ncontract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\n\n232\n\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's\nperformance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's\naverage annual returns for certain time periods compare\nwith the average annual returns of the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based securities index.

(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n235\n\nThe Index represents the retail segment of the S&P Total\nMarket Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to track\nthe broad U.S. equity market. The retail segment of the S&P\nTMI comprises the following sub-industries: Apparel Retail,\nAutomotive Retail, Broadline Retail, Computer & Electronic\nRetail, Consumer Staples Merchandise Retail, Drug Retail,\nFood Retailers, and Other Specialty Retail. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21) of the S&P Select Industry Indices\n(the \u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d), each designed to measure\nthe performance of a narrow sub-industry or group of sub-\nindustries determined based on the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select\nIndustry Indices is based on the GICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and market cap requirements. Companies in\nthe Select Industry Indices are classified according to\nGICS which determines classifications primarily based on\nrevenues; however, earnings and market perception are also\nconsidered. The Index consists of the S&P TMI constituents\nbelonging to the Apparel Retail, Automotive Retail,\nBroadline Retail, Computer & Electronic Retail, Consumer\nStaples Merchandise Retail, Drug Retail, Food Retailers,\nand Other Specialty Retail sub-industries that satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater than or equal to $500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted liquidity ratio (defined by dollar value\ntraded over the previous 12 months divided by the float-\nadjusted market capitalization as of the index rebalancing\nreference date) greater than or equal to 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization greater than or equal\nto $400 million with a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are\nU.S. based companies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for initial public offerings or spin-offs that\ndo not have 12 months of trading history is annualized. The\nmarket capitalization threshold may be relaxed to ensure\nthat there are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month. The S&P TMI tracks\nall eligible U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 77 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nRetail Companies Risk: Retail companies can be\nsignificantly affected by the performance of the domestic\nand international economy, consumer confidence and\nspending, intense competition, changes in demographics, and\nchanging consumer tastes and preferences. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and\nsold in the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times\n\n236\n\nwhen the market price of the shares is more than the net\nasset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is heightened in\ntimes of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments affecting\nissuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will\nhave a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not done\nso. Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk: The success of\nconsumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied\nclosely to the performance of the overall global economy,\ninterest rates, competition and consumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily on disposable household income and\nconsumer spending. Also, companies in the consumer\ndiscretionary sector may be subject to severe competition,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on their respective\nprofitability. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes\ncan also affect the demand for, and success of, consumer\nproducts and services in the marketplace. Consumer Staples\nSector Risk: Consumer staples companies are subject to\ngovernment regulation affecting their products which may\nnegatively impact such companies' performance. For\ninstance, government regulations may affect the\npermissibility of using various food additives and\nproduction methods of companies that make food products,\nwhich could affect company profitability. Tobacco companies\nmay be adversely affected by the adoption of proposed\nlegislation and/or by litigation. Also, the success of\nfood, beverage, household and personal product companies\nmay be strongly affected by consumer interest, marketing\ncampaigns and other factors affecting supply and demand,\nincluding performance of the overall domestic and global\neconomy, interest rates, competition and consumer\nconfidence and spending. Futures Contract Risk: A futures\ncontract is a standardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific price at\na specific future time, or cash settlement of the terms of\nthe contract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n237\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Ted Janowsky. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Ted Janowsky, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n238\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n239\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Semiconductor ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks  \n  to provide investment results that, before fees    \n  andexpenses, correspond generally to the total     \n  return performance of an index derived from the    \n  semiconductorsegment of a U.S. total market        \n  composite index.                                   \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 30 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nSemiconductor Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc.

The S&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S. equity market. The semiconductors\nsegment of the S&P TMI comprises the Semiconductors sub-\nindustry. The Index is one of twenty-one (21) of the S&P\nSelect Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to measure the performance of a narrow sub-\nindustry or group of sub-industries determined based on the\nGlobal Industry Classification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the Select Industry Indices is based on the\nGICS classification, as well as liquidity and market cap\nrequirements. Companies in the Select Industry Indices are\nclassified according to GICS which determines\nclassifications primarily based on revenues; however,\nearnings and market perception are also considered. The\nIndex consists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging to the\nSemiconductors sub-industry that satisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market capitalization\ngreater than or equal to $500 million with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of the index rebalancing reference date)\ngreater than or equal to 90% or have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to $400 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as defined above)\ngreater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar value traded\nfor initial public offerings or spin-offs that do not have\n12 months of trading history is annualized. If there are\nfewer than 35 stocks, stocks from the Semiconductor\nEquipment sub-industry that meet the market capitalization\nand liquidity thresholds are included in order of their\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization from largest to\nsmallest. If there continues to be fewer than 22 stocks,\nthe market capitalization threshold may be relaxed to\nensure that there are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of\nthe rebalancing effective date.

Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nSemiconductor Companies Risk: The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that market or economic factors impacting\nsemiconductor companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of\nsemiconductor companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\nproduct cycles, rapid product obsolescence, government\nregulation and competition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Semiconductor\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on technology,\n\n241\n\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend\nto be more volatile than the overall market. Additionally,\nsemiconductor companies may face dramatic and often\nunpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for\nthe services of qualified personnel. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments in a particular industry or sector,\nfinancial, economic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic\nsector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it\nhad not done so. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract\nis a standardized agreement that calls for the purchase or\nsale of a specific asset at a specific price at a specific\nfuture time, or cash settlement of the terms of the\ncontract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Technology Sector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological advances could\nhave a major effect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable\nto rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and internationally,\nincluding competition from foreign competitors with lower\nproduction costs. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology, especially those\nof smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more\nvolatile than the overall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual property\nrights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely\naffect profitability. Additionally, companies in the\ntechnology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for the services of\nqualified personnel.\n\n242\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Kala O'Donnell. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Kala O'Donnell is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 1995. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n243\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n244\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Software & Services ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)  \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before   \n  feesand expenses, correspond generally to the      \n  total return performance of an index derived from  \n  the computersoftware segment of a U.S. total       \n  market composite index.                            \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 41 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nSoftware & Services Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the\nFund is not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n245\n\nThe Index represents the software and services segment of\nthe S&P Total Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the broad U.S. equity market. The\nsoftware and services segment of the S&P TMI comprises the\nfollowing sub-industries: Application Software, Interactive\nHome Entertainment, IT Consulting & Other Services, and\nSystems Software. The Index is one of twenty-one (21) of\nthe S&P Select Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each designed to measure the performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined\nbased on the Global Industry Classification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select Industry Indices is\nbased on the GICS classification, as well as liquidity and\nmarket cap requirements. Companies in the Select Industry\nIndices are classified according to GICS which determines\nclassifications primarily based on revenues; however,\nearnings and market perception are also considered. The\nIndex consists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging to the\nApplication Software, Interactive Home Entertainment, IT\nConsulting & Other Services, and Systems Software sub-\nindustries that satisfy the following criteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization greater than or equal\nto $500 million with a float-adjusted liquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar value traded over the previous 12 months\ndivided by the float-adjusted market capitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing reference date) greater than or equal\nto 90% or have a float-adjusted market capitalization\ngreater than or equal to $400 million with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as defined above) greater than or equal to\n150%; and (ii) are U.S. based companies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar value traded for initial public\nofferings or spin-offs that do not have 12 months of\ntrading history is annualized. The market capitalization\nthreshold may be relaxed to ensure that there are at least\n22 stocks in the Index as of the rebalancing effective\ndate. Existing Index constituents are removed at the\nquarterly rebalancing effective date if either their float-\nadjusted market capitalization falls below $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted liquidity ratio falls below 50%. The\nmarket capitalization threshold and the liquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from time to time based on market\nconditions. The Index is modified equal weighted. The Index\nrebalances and reconstitutes quarterly on the third Friday\nof the quarter ending month and a secondary reweighting is\nperformed on the third to last business day of the quarter\nending month. The reference date for additions and\ndeletions is after the close of the last trading date of\nthe previous month. The S&P TMI tracks all eligible U.S.\ncommon equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe\nEDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 136 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nComputer Software/Services Companies Risk: Computer\nsoftware/services companies can be significantly affected\nby competitive pressures, aggressive pricing, technological\ndevelopments, changing domestic demand, the ability to\nattract and retain skilled employees and availability and\nprice of components. The market for products produced by\ncomputer software/services companies is characterized by\nrapidly changing technology, rapid product obsolescence,\ncyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and\nfrequent new product introductions. The success of computer\nsoftware/services companies depends in substantial part on\nthe timely and successful introduction of new products and\nthe ability to service such products. An unexpected change\nin one or more of the technologies affecting an issuer's\nproducts or in the market for products based on a\nparticular technology could have a material adverse effect\non a participant's operating results.\n\n246\n\nMany computer software/services companies rely on a\ncombination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade\nsecret laws to establish and protect their proprietary\nrights in their products and technologies. There can be no\nassurance that the steps taken by computer\nsoftware/services companies to protect their proprietary\nrights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of\ntheir technology or that competitors will not independently\ndevelop technologies that are substantially equivalent or\nsuperior to such companies' technology. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments in a particular industry or sector,\nfinancial, economic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic\nsector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it\nhad not done so. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract\nis a standardized agreement that calls for the purchase or\nsale of a specific asset at a specific price at a specific\nfuture time, or cash settlement of the terms of the\ncontract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Technology Sector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological advances could\nhave a major effect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable\nto rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and internationally,\nincluding competition from foreign competitors with lower\nproduction costs. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology, especially those\nof smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more\nvolatile than the overall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual property\nrights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely\naffect\n\n247\n\nprofitability. Additionally, companies in the technology\nsector may face dramatic and often unpredictable changes in\ngrowth rates and competition for the services of qualified\npersonnel.

Purchase and Sale Information\nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or\nother broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.\n\n248\n\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund\nShares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to\naccept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n249\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P Telecom ETF\n                                                  \n  Investment Objective                            \n  The SPDR S&P Telecom ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to  \n  provide investment results that, before fees    \n  andexpenses, correspond generally to the total  \n  return performance of an index derived from     \n  thetelecommunications segment of a U.S. total   \n  market composite index.                         \n                                                  \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 50 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nTelecom Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n250\n\nThe Index represents the telecommunications segment of the\nS&P Total Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed\nto track the broad U.S. equity market. The\ntelecommunications segment of the S&P TMI comprises the\nfollowing sub-industries: Alternative Carriers,\nCommunications Equipment, Integrated Telecommunication\nServices, and Wireless Telecommunication Services. The\nIndex is one of twenty-one (21) of the S&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect Industry Indices\u201d), each designed to\nmeasure the performance of a narrow sub-industry or group\nof sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select\nIndustry Indices is based on the GICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and market cap requirements. Companies in\nthe Select Industry Indices are classified according to\nGICS which determines classifications primarily based on\nrevenues; however, earnings and market perception are also\nconsidered. The Index consists of the S&P TMI constituents\nbelonging to the Alternative Carriers, Communications\nEquipment, Integrated Telecommunication Services, and\nWireless Telecommunication Services sub-industries that\nsatisfy the following criteria: (i) have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to $500 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the previous 12 months divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization as of the index\nrebalancing reference date) greater than or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted market capitalization greater than or\nequal to $400 million with a float-adjusted liquidity ratio\n(as defined above) greater than or equal to 150%; and (ii)\nare U.S. based companies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for initial public offerings or spin-offs that\ndo not have 12 months of trading history is annualized. The\nmarket capitalization threshold may be relaxed to ensure\nthat there are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month. The S&P TMI tracks\nall eligible U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 39 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nTelecommunications Sector Risk: The telecommunications\nindustry is subject to extensive government regulation. The\ncosts of complying with governmental regulations, delays or\nfailure to receive required regulatory approvals or the\nenactment of new adverse regulatory requirements may\nadversely affect the business of the telecommunications\ncompanies. The telecommunications industry can also be\nsignificantly affected by intense competition, including\ncompetition with alternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility, consumer\npreferences, rapid product obsolescence and research and\ndevelopment of new products. Technological innovations may\nmake the products and services of telecommunications\ncompanies obsolete. Other risks include uncertainties\nresulting from such companies' diversification into new\ndomestic and international\n\n251\n\nbusinesses, as well as agreements by any such companies\nlinking future rate increases to inflation or other factors\nnot directly related to the actual operating profits of the\nenterprise. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines.\nConcentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its investments\nin a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have a greater\neffect on the Fund than if it had not done so. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index.\n\n252\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 34 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nTransportation Select Industry Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n255\n\nThe Index represents the transportation segment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S. equity market. The transportation\nsegment of the S&P TMI comprises the following sub-\nindustries: Air Freight & Logistics, Airport Services,\nCargo Ground Transportation, Highways & Rail Tracks, Marine\nTransportation, Marine Ports & Services, Passenger\nAirlines, Passenger Ground Transportation, and Rail\nTransportation. The Index is one of twenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each designed to measure the performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined\nbased on the Global Industry Classification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select Industry Indices is\nbased on the GICS classification, as well as liquidity and\nmarket cap requirements. Companies in the Select Industry\nIndices are classified according to GICS which determines\nclassifications primarily based on revenues; however,\nearnings and market perception are also considered. The\nIndex consists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging to the\nAir Freight & Logistics, Airport Services, Cargo Ground\nTransportation, Highways & Rail Tracks, Marine\nTransportation, Marine Ports & Services, Passenger\nAirlines, Passenger Ground Transportation, and Rail\nTransportation sub-industries that satisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a float-adjusted market capitalization\ngreater than or equal to $500 million with a float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of the index rebalancing reference date)\ngreater than or equal to 90% or have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to $400 million\nwith a float-adjusted liquidity ratio (as defined above)\ngreater than or equal to 150%; and (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate liquidity, the dollar value traded\nfor initial public offerings or spin-offs that do not have\n12 months of trading history is annualized. The market\ncapitalization threshold may be relaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index constituents are\nremoved at the quarterly rebalancing effective date if\neither their float adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted liquidity ratio\nfalls below 50%. The market capitalization threshold and\nthe liquidity threshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index is modified equal\nweighted. The Index rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of the quarter ending month and a\nsecondary reweighting is performed on the third to last\nbusiness day of the quarter ending month. The reference\ndate for additions and deletions is after the close of the\nlast trading date of the previous month. The S&P TMI tracks\nall eligible U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ\nGlobal Market, NASDAQ Capital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX exchanges. As of July 31, 2024, the\nIndex comprised 44 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nTransportation Companies Risk: Transportation companies can\nbe significantly affected by changes in the economy, fuel\nprices, labor relations, technology developments, exchange\nrates, insurance costs, industry competition and government\nregulation. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times\n\n256\n\nwhen the market price of the shares is more than the net\nasset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is heightened in\ntimes of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Concentration Risk: When the Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments affecting\nissuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will\nhave a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not done\nso. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the purchase or sale\nof a specific asset at a specific price at a specific\nfuture time, or cash settlement of the terms of the\ncontract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs.\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Ted Janowsky. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Ted Janowsky, CFA, is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\n\n258\n\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n259\n\nAdditional Strategies Information Principal Strategies General . Please see each Fund's \u201cThe Fund's\nPrincipal Investment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund Summaries\u201d above for a discussion of each Fund's\nprincipal investment strategies. A Fund may invest in various types of securities and engage in various\ninvestment techniques which are not the principal focus of the Fund and therefore are not described in this\nProspectus. These securities, techniques and practices, together with their risks, are described in the\nStatement of Additional Information (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain free of charge by contacting\nshareholder services (see the back cover of this Prospectus for the address and phone number). The Adviser\nseeks to track the performance of each Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e ., obtain a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index). A number of factors may affect a Fund's ability to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index, and there can be no guarantee that a Fund will achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation. For example, a Fund may not be able to achieve a high degree of correlation with its Index when\nthere are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved in compiling a portfolio of securities to\nfollow the Index, when a security in the Index becomes temporarily illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or\nlegal restrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from investing in a security in the Index. The Adviser will\nutilize a sampling strategy in managing the Funds. Sampling means that the Adviser uses quantitative\nanalysis to select securities, including securities in the Index, outside of the Index and derivatives that\nhave a similar investment profile as the relevant Index in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes\nand other economic characteristics. These include industry weightings, market capitalization, and other\nfinancial characteristics of securities. The quantity of holdings in a Fund will be based on a number of\nfactors, including asset size of the Fund. In addition, from time to time, securities are added to or\nremoved from each Index. The Adviser may sell securities that are represented in an Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in an Index, in anticipation of their removal from or addition to an\nIndex. Further, the Adviser may choose to overweight securities in an Index, purchase or sell securities not\nin an Index, or utilize various combinations of other available techniques, in seeking to track an Index.\nCertain of the Funds, as described in the SAI, have adopted a non-fundamental investment policy to invest at\nleast 80% of their respective net assets, plus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in\ninvestments suggested by their respective names, measured at the time of investment. A Fund will provide\nshareholders with at least 60 days' notice prior to any change in this non-fundamental 80% investment\npolicy. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change a Fund's investment strategy, Index and\nother policies without shareholder approval, except as otherwise indicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI.\nThe Board may also change a Fund's investment objective without shareholder approval. Non-Principal\nStrategies Certain Other Investments . Each Fund may invest in structured notes (notes on which the amount\nof principal repayment and interest payments are based on the movement of one or more specified factors such\nas the movement of a particular security or index), swaps and options contracts. Swaps and options contracts\nand structured notes may be used by a Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to its Index and in\nmanaging cash flows. Temporary Defensive Positions . In certain situations or market conditions, a Fund may\ntemporarily depart from its normal investment policies and strategies, provided that the alternative is\nconsistent with the Fund's investment objective and is in the best interest of the Fund. For example, a Fund\nmay make larger than normal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure to its Index if it is unable to\ninvest directly in a component security. Borrowing Money . Each Fund may borrow money from a bank as\npermitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing statute, by the\nrules thereunder, or by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund, but only for temporary or emergency purposes. The 1940 Act presently allows a Fund\nto borrow from any bank (including pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3%\nof its total assets (not including temporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of its total assets). A Fund may\nalso invest in reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions. Consistent with a rule under\nthe 1940 Act, a Fund may treat such investments as either borrowings or derivatives\n\n260\n\ntransactions. To the extent a Fund treats reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions as\nborrowings, such investments will also be included in the 33 1/3% limit. Under normal circumstances, any\nborrowings by a Fund (including investments in reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing\ntransactions treated as borrowings) will not exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. Lending of Securities .\nEach Fund may lend its portfolio securities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets\nvia a securities lending program through its securities lending agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company\n(\u201cState Street\u201d or the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions desiring to\nborrow securities to complete transactions and for other purposes. A securities lending program allows a\nFund to receive a portion of the income generated by lending its securities and investing the respective\ncollateral. A Fund will receive collateral for each loaned security which is at least equal to the market\nvalue of that security, marked to market each trading day. To the extent a Fund receives cash collateral, as\nof the date of this Prospectus, the Adviser expects to invest such cash collateral in a fund managed by the\nAdviser that invests in: a broad range of money market instruments; certificates of deposit and time\ndeposits of U.S. and foreign banks; commercial paper and other high quality obligations of U.S. or foreign\ncompanies; asset-backed securities; mortgage-related securities; repurchase agreements; and shares of money\nmarket funds. With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive\na fee based on the amount of cash collateral. A Fund is compensated by the difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral\nother than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market\nvalue of the loaned securities. In the securities lending program, the borrower generally has the right to\nvote the loaned securities; however, a Fund may call loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the\nFund's economic interest in the investment is to be voted upon. Security loans may be terminated at any time\nby a Fund.

Aerospace and defense companies can be significantly affected by\ngovernment aerospace and defense regulation and spending policies because companies involved in this\nindustry rely to a significant extent on U.S. (and other) government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily\ninfluenced by governmental defense spending policies which are typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol the U.S. (and other) government budgets. Banking Companies Risk . The performance of bank stocks may\nbe affected by extensive governmental regulation, which may limit the amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge, and the amount of capital\nthey must maintain. The impact of changes in regulations and capital requirements on a banking company\ncannot be predicted and may negatively impact such banking company. Profitability is largely dependent on\nthe availability and cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change.\nCredit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers can negatively impact banking companies. To\nthe extent a bank's portfolio of loans or investments are concentrated in a particular industry, the bank\nmay be vulnerable to economic conditions that affect that industry. Banks may also be subject to severe\nprice competition. Competition among banking companies is high and failure to maintain or increase market\nshare may result in lost market value. Regional Bank Risk . Investments in regional banks, which may be\nsmall or medium in size, may involve greater risk than investing in larger, more established banks.\nSecurities of regional banks are often less liquid and subject to greater volatility and less trading volume\nthan is customarily associated with securities of larger banks. A regional bank's financial performance may\nbe dependent upon the business environment in certain geographic regions of the United States and, as a\nresult, adverse economic or employment developments in such regions may negatively impact such regional bank\nand, in turn, a Fund. In March 2023, the shut-down of certain regional banks resulted in concerns over\ndisruption in the U.S. banking system. Additional bank shut-downs or failures in the future could have\nadverse impacts on a Fund. Biotechnology Companies Risk . Biotech companies invest heavily in research and\ndevelopment which may not necessarily lead to commercially successful products. These companies are also\nsubject to increased governmental regulation which may delay or inhibit the release of new products. Many\nbiotech companies are dependent upon their ability to use and enforce intellectual property rights and\npatents. Any impairment of such rights may have adverse financial consequences. Biotech stocks, especially\nthose of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Biotech\ncompanies can be significantly affected by technological change and obsolescence, product liability lawsuits\nand consequential high insurance costs. Call/Prepayment Risk . Call/prepayment risk is the risk that an\nissuer will exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation held by a Fund earlier than expected or\nrequired. This may occur, for example, when there is a decline in interest rates, and an issuer of bonds or\npreferred stock redeems the bonds or stock in order to replace them with obligations on which it is required\nto pay a lower interest or dividend rate. It may also occur when there is an unanticipated increase in the\nrate at which mortgages or other receivables underlying mortgage- or asset-backed securities held by a Fund\nare prepaid. In any such case, a Fund may be forced to invest the prepaid amounts in lower-yielding\ninvestments, resulting in a decline in the Fund's income. Capital Markets Companies Risk . Companies within\nan Index can be significantly affected by stock and bank trading activity, changes in governmental\nregulation, continuing increases in price competition, decreases in fees or fee-related business, including\ninvestment banking, brokerage, asset management and other servicing fees, fluctuation in interest rates and\nother factors which could adversely affect financial markets. Clean Power Companies Risk. Clean power\ncompanies may be highly dependent upon government subsidies, contracts with government entities, and the\nsuccessful development of new and proprietary technologies. Clean power companies may be affected by\ncompetition from new and existing market entrants, obsolescence of technology, short product cycles, changes\nin exchange rates, imposition of import controls, and depletion of resources. In addition, seasonal weather\nconditions, fluctuations in supply of and demand for clean energy products or services, and international\npolitical events may cause fluctuations in the performance of clean power companies and the prices of their\nsecurities. Risks associated with fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of alternative energy\nfuels,\n\n283\n\nenergy conservation, the success of exploration projects and tax and other government regulations can\nsignificantly affect clean power companies. The supply and demand for oil and gas, the price of oil and gas,\nproduction spending, government regulation, world events and economic conditions may also affect clean power\ncompanies. Communication Services Sector Risk. Communication services companies are particularly vulnerable\nto the potential obsolescence of products and services due to technological advancement and the innovation\nof competitors. Companies in the communication services sector may also be affected by other competitive\npressures, such as pricing competition, as well as research and development costs, substantial capital\nrequirements and government regulation. Additionally, fluctuating domestic and international demand,\nshifting demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can drastically affect a\ncommunication services company's profitability. While all companies may be susceptible to network security\nbreaches, certain companies in the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and\npotential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses. Computer Software/Services Companies Risk . Computer\nsoftware/services companies can be significantly affected by competitive pressures, aggressive pricing,\ntechnological developments, changing domestic demand, the ability to attract and retain skilled employees\nand availability and price of components. The market for products produced by computer software/services\ncompanies is characterized by rapidly changing technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market\npatterns, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. The success of computer\nsoftware/services companies depends in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of new\nproducts and the ability to service such products. An unexpected change in one or more of the technologies\naffecting an issuer's products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on a participant's operating results. Many computer software/services companies rely\non a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and protect their\nproprietary rights in their products and technologies. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by\ncomputer software/services companies to protect their proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent\nmisappropriation of their technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that\nare substantially equivalent or superior to such companies' technology. Concentration Risk . A Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to the extent that the Fund's underlying\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and other developments affecting issuers in\nthat industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not focused\nits assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nConsumer Discretionary Sector Risk . The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied\nclosely to the performance of the overall global economy, interest rates, competition and consumer\nconfidence. Success depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Also, companies in\nthe consumer discretionary sector may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on\ntheir respective profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for,\nand success of, consumer products and services in the marketplace. Consumer Staples Sector Risk . Consumer\nstaples companies are subject to government regulation affecting their products which may negatively impact\nsuch companies' performance. For instance, government regulations may affect the permissibility of using\nvarious food additives and production methods of companies that make food products, which could affect\ncompany profitability. Tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the adoption of proposed legislation\nand/or by litigation. Also, the success of food, beverage, household and personal products companies may be\nstrongly affected by consumer interest, marketing campaigns and other factors affecting supply and demand,\nincluding performance of the overall domestic and international economy, interest rates, competition and\nconsumer confidence and spending. Counterparty Risk . A Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to\nthe counterparties with which the Fund enters into derivatives contracts and other transactions such as\nrepurchase agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. A Fund's ability to profit from these types of\ninvestments and transactions will depend on the willingness and ability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations. If a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate\nor realize any gain on the investment or transaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund. A Fund may\n\n284\n\nexperience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its counterparty (including recovery of any collateral posted by it) and\nmay obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances. If a Fund holds\ncollateral posted by its counterparty, it may be delayed or prevented from realizing on the collateral in\nthe event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding relating to the counterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if a Fund enters into an investment or transaction with a financial\ninstitution and such financial institution (or an affiliate of the financial institution) experiences\nfinancial difficulties, then the Fund may in certain situations be prevented or delayed from exercising its\nrights to terminate the investment or transaction, or to realize on any collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations of the parties under such investment or transactions or in\nanother institution being substituted for that financial institution without the consent of the Fund.\nFurther, a Fund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under applicable law whereby, if required by the financial\ninstitution's authority, the financial institution's liabilities could be written down, eliminated or\nconverted into equity or an alternative instrument of ownership. A bail-in of a financial institution may\nresult in a reduction in value of some or all of its securities and, if a Fund holds such securities or has\nentered into a transaction with such a financial security when a bail-in occurs, such Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Currency Risk. Investments in issuers in different countries are often denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the values of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar\nmay have a positive or negative effect on the values of a Fund's investments denominated in those\ncurrencies. The values of other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may fluctuate in response to, among\nother factors, interest rate changes, intervention (or failure to intervene) by national governments,\ncentral banks, or supranational entities such as the International Monetary Fund, the imposition of currency\ncontrols, and other political or regulatory developments. Currency values can decrease significantly both in\nthe short term and over the long term in response to these and other developments. Continuing uncertainty as\nto the status of the Euro and the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (the \u201cEMU\u201d) has created\nsignificant volatility in currency and financial markets generally. Any partial or complete dissolution of\nthe EMU, or any continued uncertainty as to its status, could have significant adverse effects on currency\nand financial markets, and on the values of a Fund's portfolio investments. Cybersecurity Companies Risk .\nCompanies in the cybersecurity field face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which\nmay have an adverse effect on profit margins. Cybersecurity companies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel. The products of cybersecurity companies may face obsolescence due\nto rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, and such companies may face\nunpredictable changes in growth rates, competition for the services of qualified personnel and competition\nfrom foreign competitors with lower production costs. Companies in the cybersecurity field are heavily\ndependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely\naffect the profitability of these companies. Cybersecurity-Related Risk . The companies included in the\nIndex rely on technologies such as the Internet and depend on computer systems to perform business and\noperational functions, and therefore may be prone to operational and information security risks resulting\nfrom cyber-attacks and/or technological malfunctions. Cyber-attacks include, among others, stealing or\ncorrupting data maintained online or digitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing information or\nservices on a website, releasing confidential information without authorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. In general, cyber-attacks are deliberate, but unintentional events may have similar effects.\nSuccessful cyber-attacks against, or security breakdowns of, a company included in the Index may result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such company, as well as other companies included in the Index, and may\ncause a Fund's investments to lose value. Debt Securities Risk . The values of debt securities may increase\nor decrease as a result of the following: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or\nperceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments or illiquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that interest rates\nrise, certain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially slower than originally anticipated and\nthe value of those securities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate environment may cause the value of a\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, a decline in the Fund's income and yield, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of a Fund's fixed income securities, and increased volatility of the fixed income markets.\nDuring periods when interest rates are at low levels, a Fund's yield can be low, and a Fund may have a\nnegative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the extent that interest rates fall,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster than\n\n285\n\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by a Fund may decline. Changes in interest rates will likely have a\ngreater effect on the values of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on investments in debt\nsecurities could trail the returns on other investment options, including investments in equity securities.\nHigh levels of inflation and/or a significantly changing interest rate environment can lead to heightened\nlevels of volatility and reduced liquidity. Depositary Receipts Risk . American Depositary Receipts (\u201cADRs\u201d)\nare typically trust receipts issued by a U.S. bank or trust company that evidence an indirect interest in\nunderlying securities issued by a foreign entity. Global Depositary Receipts (\u201cGDRs\u201d), European Depositary\nReceipts (\u201cEDRs\u201d), and other types of depositary receipts are typically issued by non-U.S. banks or\nfinancial institutions to evidence an interest in underlying securities issued by either a U.S. or a\nnon-U.S. entity. Investments in non-U.S. issuers through ADRs, GDRs, EDRs, and other types of depositary\nreceipts generally involve risks applicable to other types of investments in non-U.S. issuers. Investments\nin depositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the underlying securities in their primary\ntrading market. If a depositary receipt is denominated in a different currency than its underlying\nsecurities, a Fund will be subject to the currency risk of both the investment in the depositary receipt and\nthe underlying security. There may be less publicly available information regarding the issuer of the\nsecurities underlying a depositary receipt than if those securities were traded directly in U.S. securities\nmarkets. Depositary receipts may or may not be sponsored by the issuers of the underlying securities, and\ninformation regarding issuers of securities underlying unsponsored depositary receipts may be more limited\nthan for sponsored depositary receipts. The values of depositary receipts may decline for a number of\nreasons relating to the issuers or sponsors of the depositary receipts, including, but not limited to,\ninsolvency of the issuer or sponsor. Holders of depositary receipts may have limited or no rights to take\naction with respect to the underlying securities or to compel the issuer of the receipts to take action. The\nprices of depositary receipts may differ from the prices of securities upon which they are based. To the\nextent a Fund invests in depositary receipts based on securities included in its Index, such differences in\nprices may increase index tracking risk. Derivatives Risk. A derivative is a financial contract the value of\nwhich depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, interest rate, or index. Derivative\ntransactions typically involve leverage and may have significant volatility. It is possible that a\nderivative transaction will result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested, and a Fund may not\nbe able to close out a derivative transaction at a favorable time or price. Risks associated with derivative\ninstruments include potential changes in value in response to interest rate changes or other market\ndevelopments or as a result of the counterparty's credit quality; the potential for the derivative\ntransaction not to have the effect the Adviser anticipated or a different or less favorable effect than the\nAdviser anticipated; the failure of the counterparty to the derivative transaction to perform its\nobligations under the transaction or to settle a trade; possible mispricing or improper valuation of the\nderivative instrument; imperfect correlation in the value of a derivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that a Fund may be required to post collateral or margin with its\ncounterparty, and will not be able to recover the collateral or margin in the event of the counterparty's\ninsolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will experience losses on its derivatives investments and on\nits other portfolio investments, even when the derivatives investments may be intended in part or entirely\nto hedge those portfolio investments; the risks specific to the asset underlying the derivative instrument;\nlack of liquidity for the derivative instrument, including, without limitation, absence of a secondary\ntrading market; the potential for reduced returns to a Fund due to losses on the transaction and an increase\nin volatility; the potential for the derivative transaction to have the effect of accelerating the\nrecognition of gain; and legal risks arising from the documentation relating to the derivative transaction.\nFutures Contract Risk . The risk of loss relating to the use of futures contracts is potentially unlimited.\nThe ability to establish and close out positions in futures contracts will be subject to the development and\nmaintenance of a liquid secondary market. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an\nexchange will exist for any particular futures contract or at any particular time. In the event no such\nmarket exists, it might not be possible to effect closing transactions, and a Fund will be unable to\nterminate the futures contract. In using futures contracts, a Fund will be reliant on the ability of the\nAdviser to predict market and price movements correctly; the skills needed to use such futures contracts\nsuccessfully are different from those needed for traditional portfolio management. If a Fund uses futures\ncontracts for hedging purposes, there is a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of\nthe futures contracts and movements in the securities or index underlying the futures contracts or movements\nin the prices of the Fund's investments that are the subject of such hedge. The prices of futures contracts,\nfor a number of reasons, may not correlate perfectly with movements in the securities or index\n\n286\n\nunderlying them. For example, participants in the futures markets are subject to margin deposit\nrequirements. Such requirements may cause investors to take actions with respect to their futures positions\nthat they would not otherwise take. The margin requirements in the futures markets may be less onerous than\nmargin requirements in the securities markets in general, and as a result those markets may attract more\nspeculators than the securities markets do. Increased participation by speculators in those markets may\ncause temporary price distortions. Due to the possibility of price distortion, even a correct forecast of\ngeneral market trends by the Adviser still may not result in a successful futures activity over a very short\ntime period. The risk of a position in a futures contract may be very large compared to the relatively low\nlevel of margin a Fund is required to deposit. A Fund will typically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with its transactions in futures contracts. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain\nto the investor relative to the size of a required margin deposit. A Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its futures transactions. In the event of an insolvency of the futures commission merchant\nor a clearing house, a Fund may not be able to recover all (or any) of the margin it has posted with the\nfutures commission merchant, or to realize the value of any increase in the price of its positions, or it\nmay experience a significant delay in doing so. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and\nthe various exchanges have established limits referred to as \u201cspeculative position limits\u201d on the maximum\nnet long or net short positions that any person and certain affiliated entities may hold or control in a\nparticular futures contract. In addition, federal position limits apply to swaps that are economically\nequivalent to futures contracts that are subject to CFTC-set speculative limits. All positions owned or\ncontrolled by the same person or entity, even if in different accounts, must be aggregated for purposes of\ncomplying with position limits. It is possible that the positions of different clients managed by the\nAdviser may be aggregated for this purpose. Therefore, the trading decisions of the Adviser may have to be\nmodified and positions held by a Fund liquidated in order to avoid exceeding such limits. The modification\nof investment decisions or the elimination of open positions, if it occurs, may adversely affect the\nperformance of a Fund. A violation of position limits could also lead to regulatory action materially\nadverse to a Fund's investment strategy. In addition, exchanges may establish accountability levels\napplicable to a futures contract instead of position limits, provided that the futures contract is not\nsubject to federal position limits. An exchange may order a person who holds or controls a position in\nexcess of a position accountability level not to further increase its position, to comply with any\nprospective limit that exceeds the size of the position owned or controlled, or to reduce any open position\nthat exceeds the position accountability level if the exchange determines that such action is necessary to\nmaintain an orderly market. Position accountability levels could adversely affect a Fund's ability to\nestablish and maintain positions in commodity futures contracts to which such levels apply, if the Fund were\nto trade in such contracts, and a Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective. Futures contracts\ntraded on markets outside the U.S. are not generally subject to the same level of regulation by the CFTC or\nother U.S. regulatory entities as contracts traded in the U.S., including without limitation as to the\nexecution, delivery, and clearing of transactions. U.S. regulators neither regulate the activities of a\nforeign exchange, nor have the power to compel enforcement of the rules of the foreign exchange or the laws\nof the foreign country in question. Margin and other payments made by a Fund may not be afforded the same\nprotections as are afforded those payments in the U.S., including in connection with the insolvency of an\nexecuting or clearing broker or a clearinghouse or exchange. Certain foreign futures contracts may be less\nliquid and more volatile than U.S. contracts. Swaps Risk. A swap is a two-party contract that generally\nobligates the parties to exchange payments based on a specified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve greater risks than direct investment in securities\nbecause swaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk ( e.g. , the risk of a counterparty's\ndefaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk ( i.e. , swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). Swaps may also be considered illiquid. It may not be possible for a Fund to liquidate a swap\nposition at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses. Dividend-Paying\nSecurities Risk . Securities that pay dividends, as a group, can fall out of favor with the market, causing\nsuch companies to underperform companies that do not pay dividends. In addition, changes in the dividend\npolicies of the companies held by a Fund or the capital resources available for such company's dividend\npayments may adversely affect the Fund.\n\n287\n\nDrone Companies Risk . Drone companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel and are subject to the risks of changes in business cycles, world economic growth, technological\nprogress, and government regulation. Securities of drone companies, especially smaller, start-up companies,\ntend to be more volatile than securities of companies that do not rely heavily on technology. These\ncompanies may face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. In addition, drone\ncompanies may be dependent on the U.S. government and its agencies for a significant portion of their sales,\nand their success and growth may be dependent on their ability to win future government contracts. As a\nresult, such companies may be negatively affected by budgetary constraints, spending reductions,\ncongressional appropriations, and administrative allocations of funds that affect the U.S. government and\nits agencies. Drone companies may rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret\nlaws to establish and protect their proprietary rights in their products and technologies, and may be\nadversely affected by loss or impairment of those rights. Legal and regulatory changes may have an impact on\na drone company's products or services. In addition, drone companies may also be subject to increasing\nregulatory constraints that may limit the sale or use of a company's products, including the need to obtain\nregulatory approvals from certain government agencies. Drone companies typically engage in significant\namounts of spending on research and development, and there is no guarantee that the products or services\nproduced by these companies will be successful. Electronics Companies Risk. Electronics companies can be\nsignificantly affected by competitive pressures, aggressive pricing, technological developments, changing\ndomestic demand, the ability to attract and retain skilled employees and availability and price of\ncomponents. The market for products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, rapid product\nobsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions.\nThe success of electronics companies depends in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction\nof new products. An unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuer's products or\nin the market for products based on a particular technology could have a material adverse effect on a\nparticipant's operating results. Electronic companies may rely on a combination of patents, copyrights,\ntrademarks and trade secret laws to establish and protect their proprietary rights in their products and\ntechnologies. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by such companies to protect their proprietary\nrights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of their technology or that competitors will not\nindependently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to such companies'\ntechnology. Emerging Markets Risk . Investments in emerging markets are generally subject to a greater risk\nof loss than investments in developed markets. This may be due to, among other things, the possibility of\ngreater market volatility, lower trading volume and liquidity, greater risk of expropriation,\nnationalization, and social, political and economic instability, greater reliance on a few industries,\ninternational trade or revenue from particular commodities, less developed accounting, legal and regulatory\nsystems, increased potential for market manipulation, higher levels of inflation, deflation or currency\ndevaluation, greater risk of market shutdown, and more significant governmental limitations on investment\npolicy as compared to those typically found in a developed market. There may be limited legal rights and\nremedies for investors in companies domiciled in emerging markets. In addition, issuers (including\ngovernments) in emerging market countries may have less financial stability than in other countries. The\nsecurities of emerging market companies may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely\nheld securities. Market disruptions or substantial market corrections may limit very significantly the\nliquidity of securities of certain companies in a particular country or geographic region, or of all\ncompanies in the country or region. A Fund may be unable to liquidate its positions in such securities at\nany time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations. There is also the potential for\nunfavorable action such as embargo and acts of war. As a result, there will tend to be an increased risk of\nprice volatility in investments in emerging market countries, which may be magnified by currency\nfluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Settlement and asset custody practices for transactions in\nemerging markets may differ from those in developed markets. Such differences may include possible delays in\nsettlement and certain settlement practices, such as delivery of securities prior to receipt of payment,\nwhich increase the likelihood of a \u201cfailed settlement.\u201d Failed settlements can result in losses. For these\nand other reasons, investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative. Energy Sector Risk .\nIssuers in energy-related industries can be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and\nsupply and demand of energy fuels caused by geopolitical events, energy conservation or use of alternative\nfuel sources, the success of exploration projects, weather or meteorological events, taxes, increased\ngovernmental or environmental regulation, resource depletion, rising interest rates, declines in domestic or\nforeign production, accidents or catastrophic events, or terrorist threats or attacks, among others. Markets\nfor various energy-related commodities\n\n288\n\ncan have significant volatility, and are subject to control or manipulation by large producers or\npurchasers. Companies in the energy sector may need to make substantial expenditures, and to incur\nsignificant amounts of debt, in order to maintain or expand their reserves through exploration of new\nsources of supply, through the development of existing sources, through acquisitions, or through long-term\ncontracts to acquire reserves. Factors adversely affecting producers, refiners, distributors, or others in\nthe energy sector may affect adversely companies that service or supply those entities, either because\ndemand for those services or products is curtailed, or those services or products come under price pressure.\nEquity Investing Risk . The market prices of equity securities owned by a Fund may go up or down, sometimes\nrapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage, non-compliance with regulatory\nrequirements, and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services. The values of equity securities also\nmay decline due to general industry or market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular\ncompany, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate\nearnings, changes in interest or currency rates, or adverse investor sentiment generally. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods\nof time. Extension Risk. During periods of rising interest rates, the average life of certain types of\nsecurities may be extended because of slower-than-expected principal payments. This may increase the period\nof time during which an investment earns a below-market interest rate, increase the security's duration and\nreduce the value of the security. Extension risk may be heightened during periods of adverse economic\nconditions generally, as payment rates decline due to higher unemployment levels and other factors.\nFinancial Institutions Risk . Some instruments are issued or guaranteed by financial institutions, such as\nbanks and brokers, or are collateralized by securities issued or guaranteed by financial institutions.\nChanges in the creditworthiness of any of these institutions may adversely affect the values of instruments\nof issuers in financial industries. Financial institutions may be particularly sensitive to certain economic\nfactors such as interest rate changes, adverse developments in the real estate market, fiscal and monetary\npolicy and general economic cycles. Adverse developments in banking and other financial industries may cause\na Fund to underperform relative to other funds that invest more broadly across different industries or have\na smaller exposure to financial institutions. In the Spring of 2023, the shut\u2010down of certain financial\ninstitutions raised economic concerns over disruption in the U.S. banking system. There can be no certainty\nthat the actions taken by the U.S. government to strengthen public confidence in the U.S. banking system\nwill be effective in mitigating the effects of financial institution failures on the economy and restoring\npublic confidence in the U.S. banking system. Other adverse developments that affect financial institutions\nor the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other\nsimilar risks, may reduce liquidity in the market generally or have other adverse effects on the economy or\nthe Fund. In addition, the Fund may not be able to identify all potential solvency or stress concerns with\nrespect to a financial institution or to transfer assets from one bank or financial institution to another\nin a timely manner in the event such bank or financial institution comes under stress or fails. Changes in\ngovernmental regulation and oversight of financial institutions may have an adverse effect on the financial\ncondition or the earnings or operations of a financial institution and on the types and amounts of\nbusinesses in which a financial institution may engage. An investor may be delayed or prevented from\nexercising certain remedies against a financial institution. The amount of a Fund's assets that may be\ninvested in any financial institution, or financial institutions generally, may be limited by applicable\nlaw. Financial Sector Risk. Financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation,\nwhich may limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and the\namount of capital they must maintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition. In\naddition, deterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of\nmarkets, including U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, thereby affecting a\nwide range of financial institutions and markets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause an\nunusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses. Securities of financial services companies may\nexperience a dramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the valuations\nof their assets, take action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or cease\noperations. Credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can\n\n289\n\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be subject to severe price competition. Adverse\neconomic, business or political developments could adversely affect financial institutions engaged in\nmortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value of\nreal estate. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk . The net asset value of Fund\nShares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of a Fund's securities holdings. The market\nprices of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in a Fund's net asset value and\nsupply and demand of Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be predicted whether Fund Shares will trade\nbelow, at or above their net asset value. Price differences may be due, in large part, to the fact that\nsupply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for Fund Shares will be closely related to,\nbut not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the securities of an Index trading\nindividually or in the aggregate at any point in time. The market prices of Fund Shares may deviate\nsignificantly from the net asset value of Fund Shares during periods of market volatility. However, given\nthat Fund Shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units (unlike shares of many closed-end funds,\nwhich frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their net asset value),\nthe Adviser believes that large discounts or premiums to the net asset value of Fund Shares should not be\nsustained over long periods. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it likely that Fund\nShares normally will trade close to a Fund's net asset value, disruptions to creations and redemptions or\nmarket volatility may result in trading prices that differ significantly from such Fund's net asset value.\nIf an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time when the market price is at a premium to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares or sells at a time when the market price is at a discount to the net asset value of Fund\nShares, then the investor may sustain losses. Fossil Fuel Reserves Free Ownership Risk. The returns on a\nportfolio of securities that seeks to exclude companies that own fossil fuel reserves may trail the returns\non a portfolio of securities that includes such companies. Investing in a portfolio of securities of\ncompanies that do not own fossil fuel reserves may affect a Fund's exposure to certain types of investments\nand may impact the Fund's relative investment performance depending on whether such investments are in or\nout of favor in the market. Growth Stock Risk. The prices of growth stocks may be based largely on\nexpectations of future earnings, and their prices can decline rapidly and significantly in reaction to\nnegative news about such factors as earnings, revenues, the economy, political developments, or other news.\nGrowth stocks may underperform value stocks and stocks in other broad style categories (and the stock market\nas a whole) over any period of time and may shift in and out of favor with investors generally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on changes in market, economic, and other factors. As a result, at times when it holds\nsubstantial investments in growth stocks, a Fund may underperform other investment funds that invest more\nbroadly or that favor different investment styles. Because growth companies typically reinvest their\nearnings, growth stocks typically do not pay dividends at levels associated with other types of stocks, if\nat all. Health Care Equipment Companies Risk : Health care equipment companies are affected by rising costs\nof medical products, devices and services and the increased emphasis on the delivery of health care through\noutpatient services. Competition is high among health care equipment companies and can be significantly\naffected by extensive government regulation or government reimbursement for medical expenses. The equipment\nmay be subject to extensive litigation based on malpractice claims, product liability claims or other\nlitigation. Medical equipment manufacturers are heavily dependent on patent protection and the expiration of\npatents may adversely affect their profitability. Many new health care products are subject to the approval\nof the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The process of obtaining FDA approval is often long and\nexpensive. Health Care Sector Risk . Companies in the health care sector are subject to extensive government\nregulation and their profitability can be significantly affected by restrictions on government reimbursement\nfor medical expenses, rising costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure (including price\ndiscounting), limited product lines and an increased emphasis on the delivery of healthcare through\noutpatient services. Companies in the health care sector are heavily dependent on obtaining and defending\npatents, which may be time consuming and costly, and the expiration of patents may also adversely affect the\nprofitability of these companies. Health care companies are also subject to extensive litigation based on\nproduct liability and similar claims. In addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry\ninnovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. Many new products in the health care\nsector require significant research and development and may be subject to regulatory approvals, all of which\nmay be time consuming and costly with no guarantee that any product will come to market.\n\n290\n\nHealth Care Services Companies Risk . Health care services companies are affected by rising costs of medical\nproducts, devices and services and the increased emphasis on the delivery of health care through outpatient\nservices. Competition is high among health care services companies and can be significantly affected by\nextensive government regulation or government reimbursement for medical expenses. The equipment may be\nsubject to extensive litigation based on malpractice claims, product liability claims or other litigation.\nMedical equipment manufacturers are heavily dependent on patent protection and the expiration of patents may\nadversely affect their profitability. Many new health care products are subject to the approval of the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The process of obtaining FDA approval is often long and expensive.\nHomebuilding Companies Risk . Homebuilding companies can be significantly affected by the national, regional\nand local real estate markets. Homebuilding companies are also sensitive to interest rate fluctuations which\ncan cause changes in the availability of mortgage capital and directly affect the purchasing power of\npotential homebuyers. Homebuilding companies can be significantly affected by changes in government\nspending, consumer confidence, demographic patterns and the level of new and existing home sales. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk . Each Fund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities. Each Fund will seek to provide investment results\nthat correspond generally to the performance of the Index, regardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual securities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-\nmanaged fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. Each Fund generally will buy and will\nnot sell a security included in the Index as long as the security is part of the Index regardless of any\nsudden or material decline in value or foreseeable material decline in value of the security, even though\nthe Adviser may make a different investment decision for other actively managed accounts or portfolios that\nhold the security. As a result, a Fund's performance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed\nusing an active investment strategy. The structure and composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index (in absolute terms and by comparison with other indices) and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse\nimpact on a Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, an\nIndex may include, and the corresponding Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of\ncompanies that do not align with the Index's objective and/or criteria. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), a Fund's return may\nnot match the return of the Index for a number of reasons. For example, the return on the sample of\nsecurities purchased by a Fund (or the return on securities not included in the Index) may not correlate\nprecisely with the return of the Index. Each Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to\nthe Index, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. In addition, a Fund may not be fully invested\nat times, either as a result of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to\nmeet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities not included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between a Fund's return and that of the Index. Changes in the composition of the Index and\nregulatory requirements also may impact a Fund's ability to match the return of the Index. The Adviser may\napply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment techniques to refine or limit the number or types of issuers\nincluded in the Index in which a Fund may invest. Application of such screens or techniques may result in\ninvestment performance below that of the Index and may not produce results expected by the Adviser. Index\ntracking risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market\nconditions. Pursuant to each Index methodology, a security may be removed from an Index in the event that it\ndoes not comply with the eligibility requirements of the Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced to sell\nsecurities at inopportune times and/or unfavorable prices due to these changes in the Index components. When\nthere are changes made to the component securities of an Index and the corresponding Fund in turn makes\nsimilar changes to its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund's portfolio and the\nIndex, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly\nby the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled changes to an Index may expose the corresponding Fund to\nadditional tracking error risk. A Fund may recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the securities included in the corresponding Index. A Fund also\nmay be required to distribute any such gains to its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences.\n\n291\n\nIndustrial Sector Risk . Industrial companies are affected by supply and demand both for their specific\nproduct or service and for industrial sector products and services in general. Government regulation, world\nevents, exchange rates and economic conditions, technological developments and liabilities for environmental\ndamage and general civil liabilities will likewise affect the performance of these companies. Aerospace and\ndefense companies, a component of the industrial sector, can be significantly affected by government\nspending policies because companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services. Thus, the financial condition of, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental defense spending\npolicies which are typically under pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other) government budgets.\nTransportation securities, another component of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have occasional\nsharp price movements which may result from changes in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Infrastructure-Related Companies Risk . Infrastructure-related companies include companies\nthat primarily own, manage, develop and/or operate infrastructure assets, including transportation, utility,\nenergy and/or telecommunications assets. Infrastructure-related businesses are subject to a variety of\nfactors that may adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection\nwith capital construction programs, insurance costs, costs associated with environmental and other\nregulations, the effects of an economic slowdown, surplus capacity or technological obsolescence, industry\ncompetition, labor relations, rate caps or rate changes, uncertainties concerning availability of fuel at\nreasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and\nother factors. Certain infrastructure-related entities, particularly telecommunications and utilities\ncompanies, are subject to extensive regulation by various governmental authorities. The costs of complying\nwith governmental regulations, delays or failures to receive required regulatory approvals or the enactment\nof new adverse regulatory requirements may adversely affect infrastructure-related companies.\nInfrastructure-related companies may also be affected by service interruption and/or legal challenges due to\nenvironmental, operational or other conditions or events, and the imposition of special tariffs and changes\nin tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards. There is also the risk that corruption may\nnegatively affect publicly-funded infrastructure projects, especially in non-U.S. markets, resulting in work\nstoppage, delays and cost overruns. Other risks associated with infrastructure-related companies include\nuncertainties resulting from such companies' diversification into new domestic and international businesses,\nas well as agreements by any such companies linking future rate increases to inflation or other factors not\ndirectly related to the actual operating profits of the enterprise. Insurance Companies Risk . Insurance\ncompanies' profits are affected by many factors, including interest rate movements, the imposition of\npremium rate caps, competition and pressure to compete globally. Certain types of insurance companies may\nalso be affected by weather catastrophes and other disasters and mortality rates. In addition, although\ninsurance companies are currently subject to extensive regulation, such companies may be adversely affected\nby increased governmental regulations or tax law changes in the future. Internet Segment Risk . Internet\ncompanies are subject to rapid changes in technology, worldwide competition, rapid obsolescence of products\nand services, loss of patent protections, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent\nnew product introductions. Competitive pressures, such as technological developments, fixed-rate pricing and\nthe ability to attract and retain skilled employees, can significantly affect internet companies, and\nchanging domestic and international demand, research and development costs, availability and price\ncomponents and product obsolescence also can affect their profitability. Large-Capitalization Securities\nRisk. Securities issued by large-capitalization companies may present risks not present in smaller\ncompanies. For example, larger companies may be unable to respond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies to competitive challenges or to changes in business, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may be achieved by\nwell-managed smaller and mid-sized companies, especially during strong economic periods. Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of smaller\nand mid-sized companies. Leveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions, reverse repurchase agreements, certain\nderivatives transactions, securities lending transactions and other investment transactions such as when-\nissued, delayed-delivery, or forward commitment transactions may create investment leverage. If a Fund\nengages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund's investment portfolio, the value of the\nFund will be potentially more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. This is because\nleverage generally creates investment risk with respect to a larger base of assets than a\n\n292\n\nFund would otherwise have and so magnifies the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund's\nunderlying assets. The use of leverage is considered to be a speculative investment practice and may result\nin losses to a Fund. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of\nthe initial investment. The use of leverage may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment, interest payment, or margin obligations or to meet asset\ncoverage requirements. Limited Track Record Risk . The Fund has a limited track record and there is no\nassurance that the Fund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size is small, the Fund may experience low\ntrading volume, which could lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of\nthe Fund could cause elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its\nshareholders. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk that a Fund may not be able to dispose of\ninvestments readily at a favorable time or prices (or at all) or at prices approximating those at which a\nFund currently values them. For example, certain investments may be subject to restrictions on resale, may\ntrade in the over-the-counter market or in limited volume, or may not have an active trading market.\nIlliquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be subject to\nwide fluctuations in market value. It may be difficult for a Fund to value illiquid investments accurately.\nThe market for certain investments may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions\nindependent of any specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer. If the liquidity of a\nFund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net\nasset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Disposal of illiquid\ninvestments may entail registration expenses and other transaction costs that are higher than those for\nliquid investments. A Fund may seek to borrow money to meet its obligations (including among other things\nredemption obligations) if it is unable to dispose of illiquid investments, resulting in borrowing expenses\nand possible leveraging of the Fund. Low Volatility Risk. Although subject to the risks of common stocks,\nlow volatility stocks are seen as having a lower risk profile than the overall markets. However, a portfolio\ncomprised of low volatility stocks may not produce investment exposure that has lower variability to changes\nin such stocks' price levels. Low volatility stocks are likely to underperform the broader market during\nperiods of rapidly rising stock prices. Market Risk . Market prices of investments held by a Fund will go up\nor down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. A Fund's investments are subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile, and prices of investments can change substantially due to various\nfactors, including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers and general market liquidity. Even if general\neconomic conditions do not change, the value of an investment in a Fund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the Fund invests do not perform well or are adversely affected by\nevents. Further, legal, political, regulatory and tax changes also may cause fluctuations in markets and\nsecurities prices. Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism,\nnatural disasters, public health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments. Due to the interconnectedness of economies and financial markets throughout the world, whether\nor not a Fund invests in securities of issuers located in or with significant exposure to countries\nexperiencing economic and financial difficulties, the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments may be\nnegatively affected. A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as COVID-19, and efforts to\ncontain its spread, may result in market volatility, inflation, reduced liquidity of certain instruments,\ndisruption in the trading of certain instruments, and systemic economic weakness. The foregoing could impact\na Fund and its investments and result in disruptions to the services provided to a Fund by its service\nproviders. Additionally, in March 2023, the shutdown of certain financial institutions raised economic\nconcerns over disruption in the U.S. banking system. There can be no certainty that the actions taken by the\nU.S. government to strengthen public confidence in the U.S. banking system will be effective in mitigating\nthe effects of financial institution failures on the economy and restoring public confidence in the U.S.\nbanking system. Materials Sector Risk. Many materials companies are significantly affected by the level and\nvolatility of commodity prices, exchange rates, import controls, worldwide competition, environmental\npolicies and consumer demand. At times, worldwide production of industrial materials has exceeded demand as\na result of over-building or economic\n\n293\n\ndownturns, leading to poor investment returns or losses. Other risks may include liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for\nsafety and pollution control. The materials sector may also be affected by economic cycles, technical\nprogress, labor relations, and government regulations. Metals and Mining Companies Risk. Metals and mining\ncompanies can be significantly affected by events relating to international political and economic\ndevelopments, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, commodity prices, and tax and other\ngovernment regulations. Investments in metals and mining companies may be speculative and may be subject to\ngreater price volatility than investments in other types of companies. Risks of metals and mining\ninvestments include: changes in international monetary policies or economic and political conditions that\ncan affect the supply of precious metals and consequently the value of metals and mining company\ninvestments; the United States or foreign governments may pass laws or regulations limiting metals\ninvestments for strategic or other policy reasons; and increased environmental or labor costs may depress\nthe value of metals and mining investments. Mid-Capitalization Securities Risk . The securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies may be more volatile and may involve more risk than the securities of larger\ncompanies. These companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of larger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In addition, these\ncompanies may have been recently organized and may have little or no track record of success. The securities\nof mid-sized companies may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nThe prices of these securities may fluctuate more sharply than those of other securities, and a Fund may\nexperience some difficulty in establishing or closing out positions in these securities at prevailing market\nprices. There may be less publicly available information about the issuers of these securities or less\nmarket interest in these securities than in the case of larger companies, both of which can cause\nsignificant price volatility. Some securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may be restricted as\nto resale. Returns on investments in securities of mid-capitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger or smaller companies. Momentum Risk . The Fund employs a \u201cmomentum\u201d\nstyle of investing that emphasizes investing in securities that have had higher recent price performance\ncompared to other securities. This style of investing is subject to the risk that these securities may be\nmore volatile than a broad cross-section of securities or that the returns on securities that have\npreviously exhibited price momentum are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock\nmarket. Momentum can turn quickly and cause significant variation from other types of investments. New\nEconomies Companies Risk . The companies included in the Index are engaged in emerging industries and new\ntechnologies that may be unproven. Such industries and technologies may be adversely affected by\ntechnological advances, competition, rapid product or service obsolescence, and new and evolving\nregulations. Companies included in the Index may rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks\nand trade secret laws to establish and protect their proprietary rights in their products and technologies,\nand may be adversely affected by loss or impairment of those rights. In addition, companies in the Index may\nhave limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The Index may include stocks of\nsmaller, less-seasoned companies that may be more volatile than the overall market. Non-Diversification Risk\n. Funds classified as \u201cnon-diversified\u201d may hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many other\nfunds. To the extent a Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a decline in the market value\nof a particular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested in a larger number\nof issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. A non-diversified Fund may become diversified for periods of time solely as a result of tracking its\nIndex (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more component securities). Non-U.S. Securities Risk .\nInvestments in securities of non-U.S. issuers (including depositary receipts) entail risks not typically\nassociated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. Similar risks may apply to securities traded on a\nU.S. securities exchange that are issued by entities with significant exposure to non-U.S. countries. In\ncertain countries, legal remedies available to investors may be more limited than those available with\nregard to U.S. investments. Because non-U.S. securities are typically denominated and traded in currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar, the value of a Fund's assets, to the extent they are non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated, may be affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates, exchange control\nregulations, and restrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of non-U.S. currencies. To the extent\nunderlying securities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\n\n294\n\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there may be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security on the closed foreign market.\nThese deviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums or discounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Income and gains with respect to investments in certain countries may be\nsubject to withholding and other taxes. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S.\nentity than about a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting, auditing, and\nfinancial reporting standards, regulatory framework and practices comparable to those in the United States.\nThe securities of some non-U.S. entities are less liquid and at times more volatile than securities of\ncomparable U.S. entities, and could become subject to sanctions or embargoes that adversely affect a Fund's\ninvestment. Non-U.S. transaction costs, such as brokerage commissions and custody costs may be higher than\nin the U.S. In addition, there may be a possibility of nationalization or expropriation of assets,\nimposition of currency exchange controls, confiscatory taxation, and diplomatic developments that could\nadversely affect the values of a Fund's investments in issuers in certain non-U.S. countries. Investments in\nsecurities of non-U.S. issuers also are subject to foreign political and economic risk not associated with\nU.S. investments, meaning that political events (civil unrest, national elections, changes in political\nconditions and foreign relations, imposition of exchange controls and repatriation restrictions), social and\neconomic events (labor strikes, rising inflation) and natural disasters occurring in a country where a Fund\ninvests could cause the Fund's investments to experience gains or losses. Oil and Gas Companies Risk . Oil\nand gas companies develop and produce crude oil and natural gas and provide drilling and other energy\nresources production and distribution related services. Stock prices for these types of companies are\naffected by supply and demand both for their specific product or service and for energy products in general.\nThe price of oil and gas, exploration and production spending, government regulation, world events and\neconomic conditions will likewise affect the performance of these companies. Correspondingly, securities of\ncompanies in the energy field are subject to swift price and supply fluctuations caused by events relating\nto international politics, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, and tax and other\ngovernmental regulatory policies. Weak demand for the companies' products or services or for energy products\nand services in general, as well as negative developments in these other areas, would adversely impact the\nFund's performance. Oil and gas equipment and services can be significantly affected by natural disasters as\nwell as changes in exchange rates, interest rates, government regulation, world events and economic\nconditions. These companies may be at risk for environmental damage claims. Pharmaceuticals Companies Risk .\nPharmaceutical companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of patents may adversely\naffect the profitability of the companies. Pharmaceutical companies are also subject to extensive litigation\nbased on product liability and other similar claims. Many new products are subject to approval of the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The process of obtaining FDA approval can be long and costly and\napproved products are susceptible to obsolescence. Pharmaceutical companies are also subject to heavy\ncompetitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting.\nPreferred Securities Risk . Generally, preferred security holders have no or limited voting rights with\nrespect to the issuing company. In addition, preferred securities are generally senior to common stock, but\nmay be subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure and therefore may\nbe subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments. In the event an issuer of preferred\nsecurities experiences economic difficulties, the issuer's preferred securities may lose substantial value\ndue to the increased likelihood of deferred interest or dividend payments and the fact that the preferred\nsecurity may be subordinated to other securities of the same issuer. Further, because many preferred\nsecurities pay interest or dividends at a fixed rate, their market price can be sensitive to changes in\ninterest rates in a manner similar to bonds - that is, as interest rates rise, the value of the preferred\nsecurities held by a Fund are likely to decline. Therefore, to the extent that a Fund invests a substantial\nportion of its assets in fixed rate preferred securities, rising interest rates may cause the value of the\nFund's investments to decline significantly. In addition, to the extent preferred securities allow holders\nto convert the preferred securities into common stock of the issuer, their market price can be sensitive to\nchanges in the value of the issuer's common stock and, therefore, declining common stock values may also\ncause the value of a Fund's investments to decline. Preferred securities often have call features which\nallow the issuer to redeem the security at its discretion. The redemption of a preferred security having a\nhigher than average yield may cause a decrease in a Fund's yield.\n\n295\n\nQuality Risk . A \u201cquality\u201d style of investing emphasizes companies with high returns on equity, stable\nearnings per share growth, and low financial leverage. This style of investing is subject to the risk that\nthe past performance of these companies does not continue or that the returns on \u201cquality\u201d equity securities\nare less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market. Real Estate Sector Risk .\nThere are special risks associated with investment in securities of companies engaged in real property\nmarkets, including without limitation real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) and real estate operating\ncompanies. An investment in a real property company may be subject to risks similar to those associated with\ndirect ownership of real estate, including, by way of example, the possibility of declines in the value of\nreal estate, losses from casualty or condemnation, and changes in local and general economic conditions,\nsupply and demand, interest rates, environmental liability, zoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents,\nproperty taxes, and operating expenses. An investment in a real property company is subject to additional\nrisks, such as poor performance by the manager of the real property company, adverse changes in tax laws,\ndifficulties in valuing and disposing of real estate, and the effect of general declines in stock prices.\nSome real property companies have limited diversification because they invest in a limited number of\nproperties, a narrow geographic area, or a single type of property. Also, the organizational documents of a\nreal property company may contain provisions that make changes in control of the company difficult and time-\nconsuming. As a shareholder in a real property company, a Fund, and indirectly a Fund's shareholders, would\nbear their ratable shares of the real property company's expenses and would at the same time continue to pay\ntheir own fees and expenses. REIT Risk . REITs are subject to the risks associated with investing in the\nreal estate sector in general. In particular, a REIT may be affected by changes in the values of the\nproperties that the REIT owns or operates or that underlie the mortgages or similar real estate interests in\nwhich the REIT invests. In addition, REITs may be affected by changes to interest rates or property taxes.\nFurther, REITs are dependent upon specialized management skills, and their investments may be concentrated\nin relatively few properties, or in a small geographic area or a single property type. REITs are also\nsubject to heavy cash flow dependency and, as a result, are particularly reliant on the proper functioning\nof capital markets. In the event of a default by a borrower or lessee, the REIT may experience delays in\nenforcing its rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its\ninvestments. Investments in REITs are also subject to the risks affecting equity markets generally. In\naddition, a REIT could fail to qualify for favorable tax or regulatory treatment, which could have adverse\nconsequences for a Fund. Smaller capitalization REITs may be more volatile and may involve more risk than\nlarger capitalization REITs. Equity REITs earn income from leasing properties and realize gains and losses\nfrom the sale of properties. Equity REITs may be affected by conditions in the real estate rental market and\nby changes in the value of the properties they own. A decline in rental income may occur because of extended\nvacancies, limitations on rents, failure to collect rents or increased competition from other rental\nproperties. In addition, rising interest rates may increase the costs of obtaining financing for real estate\nprojects, which may cause the value of an equity REIT to decline. Mortgage REITs receive principal and\ninterest payments from the owners of mortgage properties. Accordingly, mortgage REITs are subject to the\ncredit risk of the borrowers, which refers to the possibility that the borrower will be unable and/or\nunwilling to make timely interest payments and/or repay the principal on the loan to the mortgage REIT when\ndue. If a mortgage REIT is required to foreclose on a borrower, the amount recovered in connection with the\nforeclosure may be less than the amount owed to the mortgage REIT. In addition, if a borrower refinances or\nprepays a mortgage, a mortgage REIT's yield may decline. Retail Companies Risk . Retail companies can be\nsignificantly affected by the performance of the domestic and international economy, consumer confidence and\nspending, intense competition, changes in demographics, and changing consumer tastes and preferences.\nSemiconductor Companies Risk. A Fund is subject to the risk that market or economic factors impacting\nsemiconductor companies and companies that rely heavily on technological advances could have a major effect\non the value of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of semiconductor companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and competition, both domestically and internationally, including\ncompetition from foreign competitors with lower production costs. Semiconductor companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile\nthan the overall market. Additionally, semiconductor companies may face dramatic and often unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel.\n\n296\n\nSettlement Risk . Markets in different countries have different clearance and settlement procedures and in\ncertain markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of\ntransactions. Delays in settlement may increase credit risk to a Fund, limit the ability of a Fund to\nreinvest the proceeds of a sale of securities, hinder the ability of a Fund to lend its portfolio\nsecurities, and potentially subject a Fund to penalties for its failure to deliver to on-purchasers of\nsecurities whose delivery to a Fund was delayed. Delays in the settlement of securities purchased by a Fund\nmay limit the ability of a Fund to sell those securities at times and prices it considers desirable, and may\nsubject a Fund to losses and costs due to its own inability to settle with subsequent purchasers of the\nsecurities from it. A Fund may be required to borrow monies it had otherwise expected to receive in\nconnection with the settlement of securities sold by it, in order to meet its obligations to others. Limits\non the ability of a Fund to purchase or sell securities due to settlement delays could increase any variance\nbetween a Fund's performance and that of its benchmark index. Small-Capitalization Securities Risk . The\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may involve more risk than the\nsecurities of larger companies. These companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial\nresources, may lack the competitive strength of larger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized and may have little or no track record of\nsuccess. The securities of smaller companies may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more\nwidely held securities. The prices of these securities may fluctuate more sharply than those of other\nsecurities, and a Fund may experience some difficulty in establishing or closing out positions in these\nsecurities at prevailing market prices. There may be less publicly available information about the issuers\nof these securities or less market interest in these securities than in the case of larger companies, both\nof which can cause significant price volatility. Some securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale. A Fund may be unable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any time,\nor at a favorable price, in order to meet a Fund's obligations. Returns on investments in securities of\nsmall-capitalization companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of larger companies.\nTechnology Sector Risk . Market or economic factors impacting technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technological advances could have a major effect on the value of the Fund's investments. The\nvalue of stocks of technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly\nvulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence, government regulation\nand competition, both domestically and internationally, including competition from foreign competitors with\nlower production costs. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Stocks of technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely\naffect profitability. Additionally, companies in the technology sector may face dramatic and often\nunpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Electronic\nMedia Companies Risk: Electronic media companies create, own, and distribute various forms of technology-\nbased visual, audio, and interactive content, as well as information databases that they sell or lease to\nothers. Electronic media companies can be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in government\nregulation, intense competition, dependency on patent protection, and rapid obsolescence of products and\nservices due to product compatibility or changing consumer preferences. Telecommunications Sector Risk. The\ntelecommunications industry is subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with\ngovernmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new\nadverse regulatory requirements may adversely affect the business of the telecommunications companies. The\ntelecommunications industry can also be significantly affected by intense competition, including competition\nwith alternative technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility, consumer preferences,\nrapid product obsolescence and research and development of new products. Technological innovations may make\nthe products and services of telecommunications companies obsolete. Other risks include uncertainties\nresulting from such companies' diversification into new domestic and international businesses, as well as\nagreements by any such companies linking future rate increases to inflation or other factors not directly\nrelated to the actual operating profits of the enterprise. Transportation Companies Risk. Transportation\ncompanies can be significantly affected by changes in the economy, fuel prices, labor relations, technology\ndevelopments, exchange rates, insurance costs, industry competition and government regulation.\n\n297\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk . A Fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time to time. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and other developments affecting issuers in\nthat industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not focused\nits assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nUtilities Sector Risk. Utility companies are affected by supply and demand, operating costs, government\nregulation, environmental factors, liabilities for environmental damage and general civil liabilities, and\nrate caps or rate changes. Although rate changes of a utility usually fluctuate in approximate correlation\nwith financing costs, due to political and regulatory factors, rate changes ordinarily occur only following\na delay after the changes in financing costs. This factor will tend to favorably affect a regulated utility\ncompany's earnings and dividends in times of decreasing costs, but conversely, will tend to adversely affect\nearnings and dividends when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt securities (and, to a\nlesser extent, equity securities) may tend to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest\nrates. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These\nutility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions\nand their traditional lines of business. These opportunities may permit certain utility companies to earn\nmore than their traditional regulated rates of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend\ntheir core business and may be less profitable. In addition, natural disasters, terrorist attacks,\ngovernment intervention or other factors may render a utility company's equipment unusable or obsolete and\nnegatively impact profitability. Among the risks that may affect utility companies are the following: risks\nof increases in fuel and other operating costs; the high cost of borrowing to finance capital construction\nduring inflationary periods; restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays associated with\ncompliance with environmental and nuclear safety regulations; and the difficulties involved in obtaining\nnatural gas for resale or fuel for generating electricity at reasonable prices. Other risks include those\nrelated to the construction and operation of nuclear power plants, the effects of energy conservation and\nthe effects of regulatory changes. Valuation Risk . Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of\nfactors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market quotations\nare not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if\nmarket quotations were used. Technological issues or other service disruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause a Fund to value its investments incorrectly. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat a Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and\nit is possible that a Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a\ndiscount to the valuation established by a Fund at that time. Value Stock Risk. Value stocks present the\nrisk that they may decline in price or never reach their expected full market value because the market fails\nto recognize the stock's intrinsic worth. Value stocks may underperform growth stocks and stocks in other\nbroad style categories (and the stock market as a whole) over any period of time and may shift in and out of\nfavor with investors generally, sometimes rapidly, depending on changes in market, economic, and other\nfactors. As a result, at times when it holds substantial investments in value stocks a Fund may underperform\nother investment portfolios that invest more broadly or that favor different investment styles. Non-\nPrincipal Risks Each risk discussed below is a non-principal risk of a Fund to the extent it is not\nidentified as a principal risk for such Fund in the preceding \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION - PRINCIPAL\nRISKS\u201d section. Authorized Participants, Market Makers and Liquidity Providers Concentration Risk. A Fund\nhas a limited number of financial institutions that may act as Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are\nresponsible for the creation and redemption activity for a Fund. In addition, there may be a limited number\nof market makers and/or liquidity providers in the marketplace. To the extent either of the following events\noccur, Fund Shares may trade at a material discount to\n\n298\n\nNAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit the business or otherwise become unable to process creation\nand/or redemption orders and no other APs step forward to perform these services, or (ii) market makers\nand/or liquidity providers exit the business or significantly reduce their business activities and no other\nentities step forward to perform their functions. Cash Transaction Risk . To the extent a Fund sells\nportfolio securities to meet some or all of a redemption request with cash, the Fund may incur taxable gains\nor losses that it might not have incurred had it made redemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, a Fund may\npay out higher annual capital gain distributions than if the in-kind redemption process was used.\nConcentration Risk. A Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to\nthe extent that the Fund's underlying Index concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries.\nWhen a Fund focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and\nother developments affecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect\non the Fund than if it had not focused its assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may\nincrease the volatility of the Fund. Conflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a Fund will be subject to\na number of actual or potential conflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser or its affiliates may\nprovide services to a Fund, such as securities lending agency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities brokerage\nservices, and other services for which the Fund would compensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates. The\nFunds may invest in other pooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates at which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its\naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters into transactions with the Adviser or its affiliates will be the\nmost favorable available in the market generally or as favorable as the rates the Adviser or its affiliates\nmake available to other clients. Because of its financial interest, the Adviser will have an incentive to\nenter into transactions or arrangements on behalf of a Fund with itself or its affiliates in circumstances\nwhere it might not have done so in the absence of that interest, provided that the Adviser will comply with\napplicable regulatory requirements. The Adviser and its affiliates serve as investment adviser to other\nclients and may make investment decisions that may be different from those that will be made by the Adviser\non behalf of the Funds. For example, the Adviser may provide asset allocation advice to some clients that\nmay include a recommendation to invest in or redeem from particular issuers while not providing that same\nrecommendation to all clients invested in the same or similar issuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to purchase (or sell) investments for a Fund and to sell (or\npurchase) the same investment for accounts, funds, or structured products for which it serves as asset\nmanager, or for other clients or affiliates. The Adviser and its affiliates may invest for clients in\nvarious securities that are senior, pari passu or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to,\nthe securities that are owned by a Fund. The Adviser or its affiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material nonpublic confidential information that may restrict the Adviser\nfrom purchasing securities or selling securities for itself or its clients (including the Funds) or\notherwise using such information for the benefit of its clients or itself. The foregoing does not purport to\nbe a comprehensive list or complete explanation of all potential conflicts of interests which may affect a\nFund. A Fund may encounter circumstances, or enter into transactions, in which conflicts of interest that\nare not listed or discussed above may arise. Costs of Buying and Selling Shares . Investors buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by\nbrokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a\nsignificant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of Fund Shares.\nIn addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the difference between the price that an\ninvestor is willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which an investor is willing\nto sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as the\n\u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time for Fund Shares based on trading volume\nand market liquidity, and is generally lower if Fund Shares have more trading volume and market liquidity\nand higher if Fund Shares have little trading volume and market liquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling Fund Shares, including\nbid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Fund Shares may significantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small\ninvestments.\n\n299\n\nCybersecurity Risk . With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on\ncomputer systems to perform business and operational functions, funds (such as the Funds) and their service\nproviders (including the Adviser) may be prone to operational and information security risks resulting from\ncyber-attacks and/or technological malfunctions. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions may have increased the\nscale and sophistication of deliberate cybersecurity attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from\nentities with nation-state backing. In general, cyber-attacks are deliberate, but unintentional events may\nhave similar effects. Cyber-attacks include, among others, stealing or corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing information or services on a website, releasing\nconfidential information without authorization, and causing operational disruption. Successful cyber-attacks\nagainst, or security breakdowns of, a Fund, the Adviser or a custodian, transfer agent, or other affiliated\nor third-party service provider may adversely affect a Fund or its shareholders. For instance, cyber-attacks\nor technical malfunctions may interfere with the processing of shareholder or other transactions, affect a\nFund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the release of private shareholder information or confidential\nFund information, impede trading, cause reputational damage, and subject a Fund to regulatory fines,\npenalties or financial losses, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and additional compliance costs.\nCyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder\nownership of Fund Shares, and other data integral to the functioning of a Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or\nincomplete. A Fund may also incur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk management in order to prevent\ncyber incidents in the future. A Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result. While\nthe Adviser has established business continuity plans and systems designed to minimize the risk of cyber-\nattacks through the use of technology, processes and controls, there are inherent limitations in such plans\nand systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified, given the evolving\nnature of this threat. Each Fund relies on third-party service providers for many of its day-to-day\noperations, and will be subject to the risk that the protections and protocols implemented by those service\nproviders will be ineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-attack. The Adviser does not control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems put in place by third-party service providers, and such third-party service\nproviders may have limited indemnification obligations to the Adviser or the Funds. Similar types of\ncybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions also are present for issuers of securities in which each Fund\ninvests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers, and may cause a Fund's\ninvestment in such securities to lose value. Index Construction Risk . A security included in an Index may\nnot exhibit the characteristic or provide the specific exposure for which it was selected and consequently a\nFund's holdings may not exhibit returns consistent with that characteristic or exposure. Index Licensing\nRisk . It is possible that the license under which the Adviser or a Fund is permitted to replicate or\notherwise use an Index will be terminated or may be disputed, impaired or cease to remain in effect. In such\na case, the Adviser may be required to replace the relevant Index with another index which it considers to\nbe appropriate in light of the investment strategy of a Fund. The use of any such substitute index may have\nan adverse impact on a Fund's performance. In the event that the Adviser is unable to identify a suitable\nreplacement for the relevant Index, it may determine to terminate a Fund. Money Market Fund Investment Risk\n. An investment in a money market fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFDIC or any other government agency. Certain money market funds seek to preserve the value of their shares\nat $1.00 per share, although there can be no assurance that they will do so, and it is possible to lose\nmoney by investing in such a money market fund. A major or unexpected change in interest rates or a decline\nin the credit quality of an issuer or entity providing credit support, an inactive trading market for money\nmarket instruments, or adverse market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause the share price of such a money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is possible that\nsuch a money market fund will issue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at times when the fair value of the\nmoney market fund's portfolio per share is more or less than $1.00. None of State Street Corporation, State\nStreet, State Street Global Advisors (\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (\u201cState Street Entities\u201d)\nguarantee the value of an investment in a money market fund at $1.00 per share. Investors should have no\nexpectation of capital support to a money market fund from State Street Entities. Other money market funds\nprice and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV that will fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of\nfund assets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or less than their original purchase\nprice. Recent changes in the regulation of money market funds may affect the operations and structures of\nmoney market funds. A money market fund may be permitted or required to impose redemption fees during times\nof market stress.\n\n300\n\nPortfolio Turnover Risk . A Fund may engage in frequent trading of its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and indirect costs and expenses to a Fund, including, for example,\nbrokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and transaction costs on the sale of\nsecurities and reinvestment in other securities. The costs related to increased portfolio turnover have the\neffect of reducing a Fund's investment return, and the sale of securities by the Fund may result in the\nrealization of taxable capital gains, including short-term capital gains. A Fund may engage in significant\ntrading of its portfolio securities in connection with Index rebalancing. Frequent or significant trading\nmay cause a Fund to incur additional transaction costs and experience different tax consequences in\ncomparison to an ETF that does not engage in frequent or significant trading. Regulatory Risk. Governmental\nand regulatory actions may have unexpected or adverse consequences on particular markets, strategies, or\ninvestments, which may adversely impact a Fund and impair how it is managed. Policy and legislative changes\nin the United States and in other countries may affect aspects of financial regulation, and may in some\ninstances contribute to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the financial markets. The impact of\nthese changes on the markets, and the practical implications for market participants, may not be fully known\nfor some time. Securities Lending Risk. Each Fund may lend portfolio securities in an amount not to exceed\n40% of the value of its net assets. For these purposes, net assets shall exclude the value of all assets\nreceived as collateral for the loan. Such loans may be terminated at any time. Any such loans must be\ncontinuously secured by collateral maintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal to the market\nvalue of the securities loaned by a Fund, marked to market each trading day. A Fund will receive the amount\nof all dividends, interest and other distributions on the loaned securities; however, the borrower has the\nright to vote the loaned securities. A Fund will call loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting\nthe investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to recall such securities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly traded securities. Securities lending involves the risk that the\nFund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. Should the borrower of the securities fail financially, a Fund may experience delays in\nrecovering the securities or exercising its rights in the collateral. Loans are made only to borrowers that\nare deemed by the securities lending agent to be of good financial standing. In a loan transaction, a Fund\nwill also bear the risk of any decline in value of securities provided as collateral or acquired with cash\ncollateral. Each Fund will attempt to minimize this risk by limiting the investment of cash collateral to\nhigh quality instruments of short maturity either directly on behalf of the lending Fund or through one or\nmore joint accounts or funds, which may include those managed by the Adviser. To the extent the collateral\nprovided or investments made with cash collateral differ from securities included in an Index, such\ncollateral or investments may have a greater risk of loss than the securities included in the Index. In\naddition, a Fund will be subject to the risk that any income generated by lending its securities or\nreinvesting cash collateral is lower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower. The Adviser will\ntake into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when overseeing a\nFund's securities lending activity. Trading Issues . Although Fund Shares are listed for trading on the\nExchange and may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the Exchange, there can\nbe no assurance that an active trading market for such Fund Shares will develop or be maintained. Trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the\nExchange, make trading in Fund Shares inadvisable. In addition, trading in Fund Shares on the Exchange is\nsubject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d\nrules. Similar to the shares of operating companies listed on a stock exchange, Fund Shares may be sold\nshort and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While each Fund expects that the ability of Authorized Participants to create and redeem Fund Shares\nat net asset value should be effective in reducing any such volatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such short sales. There can be no assurance that the requirements\nof the Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of a Fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged\nor that Fund Shares will trade with any volume, or at all, on any stock exchange. Management Investment\nAdviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement\n(\u201cInvestment Advisory Agreement\u201d) between the Trust and the Adviser, and, subject to the oversight of the\nBoard, is responsible for the investment management of each Fund. The Adviser provides an investment\nmanagement program for each Fund\n\n301\n\nand manages the investment of each Fund's assets. In addition, the Adviser provides administrative,\ncompliance and general management services to each Fund. The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State\nStreet Global Advisors, Inc., which itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Corporation. The\nAdviser is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Adviser and\ncertain other affiliates of State Street Corporation make up SSGA. SSGA is one of the world's largest\ninstitutional money managers and the investment management arm of State Street Corporation. As of June 30,\n2024, the Adviser managed approximately $1.01 trillion in assets and SSGA managed approximately $4.37\ntrillion in assets. The Adviser's principal business address is One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts\n02210. For the services provided to each Fund under the Investment Advisory Agreement, for the fiscal year\nended June 30, 2024, each Fund paid the Adviser the annual fees based on a percentage of each Fund's average\ndaily net assets as set forth below:\n                                                                \n  SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF                             0.25%     \n  SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF              0.45%     \n  SPDR Global Dow ETF                                 0.50%     \n  SPDR ICE Preferred Securities ETF                   0.45%     \n  SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactors ETF                  0.15%     \n  SPDR NYSE Technology ETF                            0.35%     \n  SPDR Portfolio S&P 1500 Composite Stock Market ETF  0.03%     \n  SPDR Portfolio S&P 400 Mid Cap ETF                  0.05%(1)  \n  SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF                          0.03%(2)  \n  SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF                   0.04%     \n  SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF            0.07%     \n  SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF                    0.04%     \n  SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap ETF                0.05%(1)  \n  SPDR Portfolio S&P Sector Neutral Dividend ETF      0.05%     \n  SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF          0.20%     \n  SPDR Russell 1000 Momentum Focus ETF                0.20%     \n  SPDR Russell 1000 Yield Focus ETF                   0.20%     \n  SPDR S&P 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF                     0.12%     \n  SPDR S&P 1500 Value Tilt ETF                        0.12%     \n  SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Growth ETF                     0.15%     \n  SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF                      0.15%     \n  SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF          0.20%     \n  SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Growth ETF                   0.15%     \n  SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Value ETF                    0.15%     \n  SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF                    0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Bank ETF                                   0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Biotech ETF                                0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Capital Markets ETF                        0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Dividend ETF                               0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF                  0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF                   0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF                           0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Insurance ETF                              0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Kensho Clean Power ETF                     0.45%     \n  SPDR S&P Kensho Final Frontiers ETF                 0.45%     \n  SPDR S&P Kensho Future Security ETF                 0.45%     \n  SPDR S&P Kensho Intelligent Structures ETF          0.45%     \n  SPDR S&P Kensho New Economies Composite ETF         0.20%     \n  SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF                  0.45%     \n  SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF                        0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services ETF         0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF     0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF                        0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF                       0.35%     \n  SPDR S&P Retail ETF                                 0.35%     \n                                                                \n302\n                                           \n  SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF        0.35%  \n  SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF  0.35%  \n  SPDR S&P Telecom ETF              0.35%  \n  SPDR S&P Transportation ETF       0.35%  \n                                           \n(1) Effective August 1, 2023, the Adviser agreed to reduce the Fund's management fee from 0.05% to 0.03% of\nthe Fund's average daily net assets. (2) Effective August 1, 2023, the Adviser agreed to reduce the Fund's\nmanagement fee from 0.03% to 0.02% of the Fund's average daily net assets. From time to time, the Adviser\nmay waive all or a portion of its management fee. The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of\nits management fee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount equal to any acquired fund fees and expenses\n(excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash management purposes, if any) for each Fund until October 31,\n2025. This waiver and/or reimbursement does not provide for the recoupment by the Adviser of any amounts\nwaived or reimbursed. This waiver and/or reimbursement may not be terminated prior to October 31, 2025\nexcept with the approval of the Board. The Adviser pays all expenses of each Fund other than the management\nfee, brokerage expenses, taxes, interest, fees and expenses of the Independent Trustees (including any\nTrustee's counsel fees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees and expenses and other extraordinary\nexpenses. A discussion regarding the Board's consideration of the Investment Advisory Agreement is provided\nin the Funds' Form N-CSR filing with the SEC for the period ended June 30, 2024. SSGA FM, as the investment\nadviser for the Funds, may hire one or more sub-advisers to oversee the day-to-day investment activities of\nthe Funds. The sub-advisers are subject to oversight by the Adviser. The Adviser and SPDR Series Trust (the\n\u201cTrust\u201d) have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits the Adviser, with the approval of the\nBoard, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, of the Trust, to retain and amend existing sub-\nadvisory agreements with unaffiliated investment sub-advisers for a Fund without submitting the sub-advisory\nagreement to a vote of the Fund's shareholders. The Trust will notify shareholders in the event of any\nchange in the identity of such sub-adviser or sub-advisers.

Additional Purchase and Sale Information Fund Shares are\nlisted for secondary trading on the Exchange and individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold in\nthe secondary market through a broker-dealer. The secondary markets are closed on weekends and also are\ngenerally closed on the following holidays: New Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents'\nDay, Good Friday, Memorial Day (observed), Juneteenth National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor\nDay,\n\n311\n\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Exchange may close early on the business day before certain holidays\nand on the day after Thanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to change without notice. If\nyou buy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary market, you will pay the secondary market price for Fund\nShares. In addition, you may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges and may pay some or all of\nthe spread between the bid and the offered price in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip\n(purchase and sale) transaction. The trading prices of Fund Shares will fluctuate continuously throughout\ntrading hours based on market supply and demand rather than the relevant Fund's net asset value, which is\ncalculated at the end of each business day. Fund Shares will trade on the Exchange at prices that may be\nabove ( i.e ., at a premium) or below ( i.e ., at a discount), to varying degrees, the daily net asset value\nof Fund Shares. The trading prices of Fund Shares may deviate significantly from the relevant Fund's net\nasset value during periods of market volatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares can be issued and redeemed\ndaily in Creation Units, the Adviser believes that large discounts and premiums to net asset value should\nnot be sustained over long periods. The Exchange will disseminate, every fifteen seconds during the regular\ntrading day, an indicative optimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to each Fund. The IOPV calculations\nare estimates of the value of each Fund's net asset value per Fund Share. Premiums and discounts between the\nIOPV and the market price may occur. This should not be viewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset\nvalue per Fund Share. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the published basket of portfolio\nsecurities and/or cash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit and does not necessarily\nreflect the precise composition of a Fund's actual portfolio at a particular point in time. Moreover, the\nIOPV is generally determined by using current market quotations and/or price quotations obtained from\nbroker-dealers and other market intermediaries and valuations based on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the NAV, which (i) is computed only once a day, (ii) unlike the\ncalculation of the IOPV, takes into account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be subject, in accordance with the\nrequirements of the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at different prices than those used in the calculations of\nthe IOPV. The IOPV price is based on quotes and closing prices from the securities' local market converted\ninto U.S. dollars at the current currency rates and may not reflect events that occur subsequent to the\nlocal market's close. Therefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best possible valuation of a Fund's current\nportfolio. Neither the Funds nor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for,\nthe calculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and make no warranty as to their accuracy. The Funds do not\nimpose any restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions; however, the Funds reserve the right\nto reject or limit purchases at any time as described in the SAI. When considering that no restriction or\npolicy was necessary, the Board evaluated the risks posed by market timing activities, such as whether\nfrequent purchases and redemptions would interfere with the efficient implementation of a Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause a Fund to experience increased transaction costs. The Board considered\nthat, unlike traditional mutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and redeemed only in large quantities of\nshares known as Creation Units, available only from a Fund directly, and that most trading in a Fund occurs\non the Exchange at prevailing market prices and does not involve the Fund directly. Given this structure,\nthe Board determined that it is unlikely that (a) market timing would be attempted by a Fund's shareholders\nor (b) any attempts to market time a Fund by shareholders would result in negative impact to the Fund or its\nshareholders. Distributions Dividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are entitled to your\nshare of the applicable Fund's income and net realized gains on its investments. Each Fund pays out\nsubstantially all of its net earnings to its shareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d Each Fund may earn income\ndividends from stocks, interest from debt securities and, if participating, securities lending income. These\namounts, net of expenses and taxes (if applicable), are passed along to Fund shareholders as \u201cincome\ndividend distributions.\u201d Each Fund will generally realize short-term capital gains or losses whenever it\nsells or exchanges assets held for one year or less. Net short-term capital gains will generally be treated\nas ordinary income when distributed to shareholders. Each Fund will generally realize long-term capital\ngains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets held for more than one year. Net capital gains (the\nexcess of a Fund's net long-term capital gains over its net short-term capital losses) are distributed to\nshareholders as \u201ccapital gain distributions.\u201d\n\n312\n\nIncome dividend distributions, if any, for the Funds (except the SPDR ICE Preferred Securities ETF and SPDR\nMSCI USA StrategicFactors SM ETF) are generally distributed to shareholders quarterly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Income dividend distributions, if any, for the SPDR ICE Preferred\nSecurities ETF and SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactors SM ETF are generally distributed to shareholders monthly\nand semi-annually, respectively, but may vary significantly from period to period. Net capital gains for\neach Fund are distributed at least annually. Dividends may be declared and paid more frequently or at any\nother time to improve Index tracking or to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code. For the\nSPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF, SPDR ICE Preferred Securities ETF, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF and\nSPDR S&P Dividend ETF: the Funds intend to distribute at least annually amounts representing the full\ndividend yield net of expenses on the underlying investment securities as if the Fund owned the underlying\ninvestment securities for the entire dividend period. As a result, some portion of each distribution may\nresult in a return of capital. You will be notified regarding the portion of the distribution which\nrepresents a return of capital. Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole\nFund Shares only if the broker through whom you purchased Fund Shares makes such option available.\nDistributions which are reinvested will nevertheless be taxable to the same extent as if such distributions\nhad not been reinvested. Portfolio Holdings Disclosure The Funds' portfolio holdings disclosure policy is\ndescribed in the SAI. In addition, the identities and quantities of the securities held by each Fund are\ndisclosed on the Funds' website. Additional Tax Information The following discussion is a summary of some\nimportant U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to an investment in a Fund. Your\ninvestment in a Fund may have other tax implications. Please consult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to you. Investors, including non-U.S. investors, may wish to\nconsult the SAI tax section for additional disclosure. Each Fund has elected or will elect to be a regulated\ninvestment company and intends to qualify each year to be treated as such. A regulated investment company is\ngenerally not subject to tax at the corporate level on income and gains that are distributed to\nshareholders. However, a Fund's failure to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company may\nresult in corporate level taxation, and consequently, a reduction in income available for distribution to\nshareholders. Taxes on Distributions. In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when\nthey are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in a Fund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from a Fund will be taxed as either ordinary income or qualified\ndividend income. Subject to certain limitations, dividends that are reported by a Fund as qualified dividend\nincome are taxable to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Any distributions of a Fund's net capital\ngains are taxable as long-term capital gain regardless of how long you have owned Fund Shares. Long-term\ncapital gains are generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Distributions in excess of\na Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the\nextent of your basis in the applicable Fund's shares, and, in general, as capital gain thereafter. In\ngeneral, dividends may be reported by a Fund as qualified dividend income if they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income received by the Fund, which, in general, includes dividend income from taxable\nU.S. corporations and certain foreign corporations ( i.e ., certain foreign corporations incorporated in a\npossession of the United States or in certain countries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the United\nStates, and certain other foreign corporations if the stock with respect to which the dividend is paid is\nreadily tradable on an established securities market in the United States), provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its\nposition in the stock in certain ways. A dividend generally will not be treated as qualified dividend income\nif the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held by a Fund for fewer than 61 days during\nthe 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-\ndividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, for fewer than 91 days\n\n313\n\nduring the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date. These holding period requirements will also\napply to your ownership of Fund Shares. Holding periods may be suspended for these purposes for stock that\nis hedged. Additionally, income derived in connection with a Fund's securities lending activities will not\nbe treated as qualified dividend income. U.S. individuals with income exceeding specified thresholds are\nsubject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on all or a portion of their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which\nincludes taxable interest, dividends and certain capital gains (generally including capital gain\ndistributions and capital gains realized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or\na portion of the undistributed net investment income of certain shareholders that are estates and trusts.\nCertain tax-exempt educational institutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on net investment income. For\nthese purposes, certain dividends and capital gain distributions, and certain gains from the disposition of\nFund Shares (among other categories of income), are generally taken into account in computing a\nshareholder's net investment income. If you lend your Fund Shares pursuant to securities lending\narrangements you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares are held by the\nborrower) as qualified dividend income. You should consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor to\ndiscuss your particular circumstances. Distributions paid in January, but declared by a Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year, payable to shareholders of record in such a month, may be taxable\nto you in the calendar year in which they were declared. The Funds will inform you of the amount of your\nordinary income dividends, qualified dividend income and capital gain distributions shortly after the close\nof each calendar year. A distribution will reduce a Fund's net asset value per Fund Share and may be taxable\nto you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may\nconstitute a return of capital. Derivatives and Other Complex Securities. A Fund may invest in complex\nsecurities. These investments may be subject to numerous special and complex rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund are treated as ordinary income or capital gain, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to a Fund and/or defer a Fund's ability to recognize losses. In turn, these rules may\naffect the amount, timing or character of the income distributed to you by a Fund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding the application of these rules. Master Limited Partnerships. Depreciation or\nother cost recovery deductions from a Fund's investments in MLPs in a given year will generally reduce the\nFund's taxable income, but those deductions may be recaptured in the Fund's income in one or more subsequent\nyears. When recognized and distributed, recapture income will generally be taxable to shareholders at the\ntime of the distribution at ordinary income tax rates, even though the shareholders at that time might not\nhave held Fund Shares at the time the deductions were taken by the Fund, and even though those shareholders\nwill not have corresponding economic gain on their Fund Shares at the time of the recapture. In order to\ndistribute recapture income or to fund redemption requests, the Fund may need to liquidate investments,\nwhich may lead to additional recapture income. The Fund's investments in MLPs and related entities treated\nas partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes potentially will result in distributions from the\ncorresponding Fund being treated as return-of-capital distributions, which are not included in a\nshareholder's income but which reduce the shareholder's tax basis in his or her Fund Shares and therefore\nincrease gains or decrease losses on dispositions of those Fund Shares. The Fund's investments in MLPs or\nrelated entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also cause the\ncorresponding Fund to recognize taxable income on investments in excess of the cash generated thereby, and\nmay therefore require the Fund to sell investments, including when not otherwise advantageous to do so, in\norder for the Fund to satisfy the distribution requirements for treatment as a regulated investment company.\nNoncorporate taxpayers are generally eligible for a deduction of up to 20% of \u201cqualified publicly traded\npartnership income.\u201d The fund will not be able to claim such a deduction in respect of income allocated to\nit by any MLPs or other publicly traded partnerships in which it invests, and shareholders will not be able\nto claim such a deduction in respect of Fund dividends attributable to any such income. Foreign Currency\nTransactions. A Fund's transactions in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated debt obligations and\ncertain foreign currency options, futures contracts and forward contracts (and similar instruments) may give\nrise to ordinary income or loss to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of\nthe foreign currency concerned.\n\n314\n\nForeign Income Taxes. Investment income received by a Fund from sources within foreign countries may be\nsubject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. The United States has entered into tax treaties with\nmany foreign countries which may entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of such taxes or exemption from taxes on\nsuch income. It is impossible to determine the effective rate of foreign tax for a Fund in advance since the\namount of the assets to be invested within various countries is not known. If more than 50% of the total\nassets of a Fund at the close of its taxable year consist of certain foreign stocks or securities, the Fund\nmay elect to \u201cpass through\u201d to you certain foreign income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the\nFund. If a Fund in which you hold Fund Shares makes such an election, you will be considered to have\nreceived as an additional dividend your share of such foreign taxes, but you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit\nin calculating your federal income tax. No deduction for such taxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax liability. If a Fund does not so elect, the Fund will be entitled to\nclaim a deduction for certain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund. Under certain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign taxes paid in respect of a prior year, the value of Fund Shares could be\naffected or any foreign tax credits or deductions passed through to shareholders in respect of the Fund's\nforeign taxes for the current year could be reduced. Real Estate Investments. Non-U.S. persons are generally\nsubject to U.S. tax on a disposition of a \u201cUnited States real property interest\u201d (a \u201cUSRPI\u201d). Gain on such a\ndisposition is generally referred to as \u201cFIRPTA gain.\u201d The Code provides a look-through rule for\ndistributions of so-called FIRPTA gain by a Fund if certain requirements are met. If the look-through rule\napplies, certain distributions attributable to income received by a Fund, e.g., from U.S. REITs, may be\ntreated as gain from the disposition of a USRPI, causing distributions to be subject to U.S. withholding\ntaxes, and requiring non-U.S. investors to file nonresident U.S. income tax returns. Also, gain may be\nsubject to a 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a foreign stockholder that is treated as a corporation\nfor federal income tax purposes. Under certain circumstances, Fund Shares may qualify as USRPIs, which could\nresult in 15% withholding on certain distributions and gross redemption proceeds paid to certain non-U.S.\nshareholders. For tax years beginning before January 1, 2026, a noncorporate taxpayer is generally eligible\nfor a deduction of up to 20% of the taxpayer's \u201cqualified REIT dividends.\u201d If a Fund receives dividends\n(other than capital gain dividends) in respect of U.S. REIT shares, the Fund may report its own dividends as\neligible for the 20% deduction, to the extent the Fund's income is derived from such qualified REIT\ndividends, as reduced by allocable Fund expenses. In order for a Fund's dividends to be eligible for this\ndeduction when received by a noncorporate shareholder, the Fund must meet certain holding period\nrequirements with respect to the U.S. REIT shares on which the Fund received the eligible dividends, and the\nnoncorporate shareholder must meet certain holding period requirements with respect to the Fund Shares.\nIndex Concentration . In order to qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to RICs, a\nFund must satisfy certain diversification requirements. In particular, a Fund generally may not acquire a\nsecurity if, as a result of the acquisition, more than 50% of the value of the Fund's assets would be\ninvested in (a) issuers in which the Fund has, in each case, invested more than 5% of the Fund's assets and\n(b) issuers more than 10% of whose outstanding voting securities are owned by the Fund. Given the\nconcentration of certain indexes tracked by certain Funds in a relatively small number of securities, it may\nnot be possible for such Funds to fully implement its strategy while satisfying these diversification\nrequirements. A Fund's efforts to satisfy the diversification requirements may affect a Fund's execution of\nits investment strategy and may cause a Fund's return to deviate from that of the Index, and a Fund's\nefforts to track the Index may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy the diversification requirements.\nIf a Fund were to fail to qualify as a RIC, it would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation,\nand distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by the Fund in computing its taxable income.\nTaxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund Shares is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been held for more than one year and\nas short-term capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been held for one year or less, except that any\ncapital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to\nthe extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to such Fund Shares. Taxes on Creations and\nRedemptions of Creation Units. A person who exchanges securities for Creation Units generally will recognize\na gain or loss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the market value of the Creation\nUnits at the time and the exchanger's aggregate basis in the securities surrendered plus any cash paid for\n\n315\n\nthe Creation Units. A person who exchanges Creation Units for securities will generally recognize a gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the exchanger's basis in the Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash received. The Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), however,\nmay assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be deducted\ncurrently under the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the basis that there has been no significant change\nin economic position. Persons exchanging securities should consult their own tax advisor with respect to\nwhether wash sale rules apply and when a loss might be deductible. Under current federal tax laws, any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a redemption (or creation) of Creation Units is generally treated as\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have been held for\nmore than one year and as a short-term capital gain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or securities\nsurrendered) have been held for one year or less. If you create or redeem Creation Units, you will be sent a\nconfirmation statement showing how many Fund Shares you purchased or sold and at what price. The Trust on\nbehalf of each Fund has the right to reject an order for Creation Units if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of\nthe applicable Fund and if, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the applicable Fund would have a basis in\nthe securities different from the market value of the securities on the date of deposit. The Trust also has\nthe right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. If the Trust does issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a group of purchasers) that would,\nupon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the applicable Fund,\nthe purchaser (or group of purchasers) will not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of securities for\nCreation Units. If a Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear additional costs and recognize more\ncapital gains than it would if it redeems Creation Units in-kind. Certain Tax-Exempt Investors. A Fund, if\ninvesting in certain limited real estate investments and other publicly traded partnerships, may be required\nto pass through certain \u201cexcess inclusion income\u201d and other income as \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d\n(\u201cUBTI\u201d). Prior to investing in a Fund, tax-exempt investors sensitive to UBTI should consult their tax\nadvisors regarding this issue and IRS pronouncements addressing the treatment of such income in the hands of\nsuch investors. Investments In Certain Foreign Corporations. A Fund may invest in foreign entities\nclassified as passive foreign investment companies or \u201cPFICs\u201d or controlled foreign corporations or \u201cCFCs\u201d\nunder the Code. PFIC and CFC investments are subject to complex rules that may under certain circumstances\nadversely affect a Fund. Accordingly, investors should consult their own tax advisors and carefully consider\nthe tax consequences of PFIC and CFC investments by a Fund before making an investment in such Fund. Fund\ndividends attributable to dividends received from PFICs generally will not be treated as qualified dividend\nincome. Additional information pertaining to the potential tax consequences to the Funds, and to the\nshareholders, from the Funds' potential investment in PFICs and CFCs can be found in the SAI. Non-U.S.\nInvestors. Ordinary income dividends paid by a Fund to shareholders who are non-resident aliens or foreign\nentities will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than distributions reported by the\nFund as interest-related dividends and short-term capital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty rate\napplies or unless such income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. In general, a Fund may\nreport interest-related dividends to the extent of its net income derived from U.S.-source interest, and a\nFund may report short-term capital gain dividends to the extent its net short-term capital gain for the\ntaxable year exceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains on the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. will\ngenerally be subject to U.S. federal net income taxation at regular income tax rates. Non-U.S. shareholders\nthat own, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of a Fund's shares are urged to consult their own tax\nadvisors concerning special tax rules that may apply to their investment.\n\n316\n\nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply with IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding U.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts with, such\nentities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to distributions payable to such entities. A non-U.S. shareholder\nmay be exempt from the withholding described in this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental\nagreement between the U.S. and a foreign government, provided that the shareholder and the applicable\nforeign government comply with the terms of such agreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund will be required in\ncertain cases to withhold (as \u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has\nprovided the Fund either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, (2) is subject to\nbackup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, (3) has\nfailed to certify to the Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or (4) has not\ncertified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will not be applied to payments that have been subject to the 30%\nwithholding tax on shareholders who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of the United States. Other\nTax Issues. A Fund may be subject to tax in certain states where the Fund does business (or is treated as\ndoing business as a result of its investments). Furthermore, in those states which have income tax laws, the\ntax treatment of the Funds and of Fund shareholders with respect to distributions by the Funds may differ\nfrom federal tax treatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current\nfederal income tax law of an investment in the Funds. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice.\nConsult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in the Funds under\nall applicable tax laws. General Information The Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on\nJune 12, 1998. If shareholders of any Fund are required to vote on any matters, shareholders are entitled to\none vote for each Fund Share they own. Annual meetings of shareholders will not be held except as required\nby the 1940 Act and other applicable law. See the SAI for more information concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization Each Fund is a separate series of the Trust, which is an open-end\nregistered management investment company. From time to time, a Fund may advertise yield and total return\nfigures. Yield is a historical measure of dividend income, and total return is a measure of past dividend\nincome (assuming that it has been reinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither yield nor total return\nshould be used to predict the future performance of a Fund. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel to\nthe Trust, including the Funds. Ernst & Young LLP serves as the independent registered public accounting\nfirm and will audit the Funds' financial statements annually. Financial Highlights These financial highlight\ntables are intended to help you understand each Fund's financial performance for the past five fiscal years\nor, if shorter, the period since each Fund's inception. Certain information reflects the performance results\nfor a single Fund Share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have\nearned (or lost) on an investment in each Fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions).\nThis information has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the Trust's independent registered public accounting\nfirm, whose report, along with each Fund's financial highlights and financial statements, is included in the\nForm N-CSR, which is available upon request. Any references to Notes in these financial highlight tables\nrefer to the \u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d section of each Fund's financial statements, and the financial\ninformation included

You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.12%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.12%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 22 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the SSGA US\nLarge Cap Low Volatility Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index,\n\n1\n\nthe Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of the\nstocks of U.S. large capitalization companies that exhibit\nlow volatility. Volatility is a statistical measurement of\nthe magnitude of movements in a stock's price over time. In\nselecting constituents from the Index Universe (defined\nherein), the Index utilizes a proprietary rules-based\nprocess that seeks to increase exposure to stocks in the\nIndex Universe that exhibit low volatility. The initial\nuniverse of securities eligible for inclusion in the Index\n(the \u201cIndex Universe\u201d) is comprised of the largest 1,000\nU.S. stocks, based on market capitalization, listed on a\nU.S. national securities exchange that have trailing six-\nmonth average daily trading volumes of at least 250,000\nshares and free float factors (percentage of common shares\noutstanding readily available in the market) greater than\n50% as of the Index rebalance determination date. Eligible\nstocks are assigned to a sector and ranked within each\nsector according to their volatility. A stock's volatility\nis measured by the standard deviation of monthly total\nreturns to that stock's price over the trailing 5 years as\nof the Index rebalance determination date. For stocks with\nless than 5 years of monthly returns, volatility is\nmeasured by available monthly returns if the stock has at\nleast 2.5 years of monthly returns or by the average\nvolatility of stocks in the same sector in the Investment\nUniverse if the stock has fewer than 2.5 years of monthly\nreturns. For each sector, stocks with the lowest volatility\nwhose combined free float sector market capitalization\nequals 30% are selected for inclusion in the Index,\nincluding the first stock that brings the combined sector\nmarket capitalization above 30%. The Index weights\nconstituent securities such that securities with the lowest\nvolatility receive the highest weights in the Index,\nsubject to liquidity constraints limiting a constituent's\nweighting in the Index to 5% and to 20 times the\nconstituent's weight within the Index Universe. The Index\nrebalance determination date is 10 business days prior to\nthe last business day of March. Index rebalancings are\neffective after the close of the last business day of\nMarch. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nFund comprised companies in the financial and industrial\nsectors, although this may change from time to time. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, there were 162 securities in the Index. The\nIndex was created and is sponsored by State Street Global\nAdvisors (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d or \u201cSSGA\u201d), an affiliate of\nthe Fund and of SSGA FM, the Fund's Adviser. The Index\nProvider establishes and maintains rules which are used to\ndetermine the composition of the Index and relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the Fund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will\nchange in value, and you could lose money by investing in\nthe Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or\nany other government agency. Market Risk: The Fund's\ninvestments are subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and the risks\ninherent in investment in securities markets. Investment\nmarkets can be volatile and prices of investments can\nchange substantially due to various factors including, but\nnot limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in\ninterest rates, inflation, changes in the actual or\nperceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market\nliquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk that\ngeopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and\nadversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market prices of\nequity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security\nmay decline for a number of reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer and also may decline due to general\nindustry or market conditions that are not specifically\nrelated to a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock\nprices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nLarge-Capitalization Securities Risk: Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail\nthe returns on investments in securities of smaller and\nmid-sized companies. Larger companies may be unable to\nrespond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in business, product,\nfinancial, or other market conditions. Larger companies may\nnot be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized\ncompanies. Low Volatility Risk: Although subject to the\nrisks of common stocks, low volatility stocks are seen as\nhaving a lower risk profile than the overall markets.\nHowever, a portfolio comprised of low volatility stocks may\nnot produce investment exposure that has lower variability\nto changes in such stocks' price levels. Low volatility\nstocks are likely to underperform the broader market during\nperiods of rapidly rising stock prices. 2 Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and\nsold in the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Financial Sector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which may limit both the amounts and types of\nloans and other financial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of\nthe credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in\na broad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. 3\n\nIndustrial Sector Risk: Industrial companies are affected\nby supply and demand both for their specific product or\nservice and for industrial sector products and services in\ngeneral. Government regulation, world events, exchange\nrates and economic conditions, technological developments\nand liabilities for environmental damage and general civil\nliabilities will likewise affect the performance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of\nthe industrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial portion of its assets within one or\nmore economic sectors or industries, which may change from\ntime to time. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential for\nvolatility and the risk that events negatively affecting\nsuch sectors or industries could reduce returns,\npotentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly. Fund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart and table provide an indication of the\nrisks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the\nFund's performance from year to year and by showing how the\nFund's average annual returns for certain time periods\ncompare with the average annual returns of the Index and of\na relevant broad-based securities index. The Fund's past\nperformance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an\nindication of how the Fund will perform in the future.\nUpdated performance information is available by calling\n1-866-787-2257 or visiting our website at\nhttps://www.ssga.com .\n\nAnnual Total Returns (years ended 12/31)\n                                                   \n                            Returns  Quarter/Year  \n  Highest Quarterly Return  13.41%   Q4 2021       \n  Lowest Quarterly Return   -20.26%  Q1 2020       \n  Year-to-Date              18.56%   9/30/2024     \n                                                   \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods ended 12/31/23) The after-tax returns presented in the table below\nare calculated using highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the\nimpact of state and local taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective December 13, 2016 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Russell 1000 Low Volatility Index (the \u201cPrevious\nBenchmark Index\u201d) to the SSGA US Large Cap Low Volatility Index, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the performance of the current index. Performance of the Fund prior\nto the Benchmark Index Change Date is therefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index and may have been different had the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                                                                 \n                                                   OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                              9.18%    12.55%     11.01%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions              8.58%    11.95%     10.04%    \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of  5.74%    9.90%      8.67%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                    \n  SSGA US Large Cap Low Volatility Index/Russell                                 \n  1000 Low Volatility Index1(reflects no           9.30%    12.67%     11.17%    \n  deductionfor fees, expenses or taxes)                                          \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,   26.29%   15.69%     12.03%    \n  expenses or taxes)                                                             \n                                                                                 \n(1) Returns shown are reflective of the Index for periods beginning on the Benchmark Index Change Date and\nthe Previous Benchmark Index for periods prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date.\n\n4\n\nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl\nSchneider and Juan Acevedo. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Juan Acevedo is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2000. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a\ntax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made\nfrom such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information. 5\n\nSPDR \u00ae SSGA US Small Cap Low Volatility Index ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR SSGA US Small Cap Low Volatility Index    \n  ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment       \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses, correspond  \n  generally to the total return performance of a     \n  small cap, lowvolatility index.                    \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 56 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the SSGA US\nSmall Cap Low Volatility Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n6\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of the\nstocks of U.S. small capitalization companies that exhibit\nlow volatility. Volatility is a statistical measurement of\nthe magnitude of movements in a stock's price over time. In\nselecting constituents from the Index Universe (defined\nherein), the Index utilizes a proprietary rules-based\nprocess that seeks to increase exposure to stocks in the\nIndex Universe that exhibit low volatility. The initial\nuniverse of securities eligible for inclusion in the Index\n(the \u201cIndex Universe\u201d) is comprised of the 2,000 U.S.\nstocks listed on a U.S. national securities exchange whose\nmarket capitalizations rank from 1,001 to 3,000 that have\ntrailing six-month average daily trading volumes of at\nleast 250,000 shares and free float factors (percentage of\ncommon shares outstanding readily available in the market)\ngreater than 50% as of the Index rebalance determination\ndate. Eligible stocks are assigned to a sector and ranked\nwithin each sector according to their volatility. A stock's\nvolatility is measured by the standard deviation of monthly\ntotal returns to that stock's price over the trailing 5\nyears as of the Index rebalance determination date. For\nstocks with less than 5 years of monthly returns,\nvolatility is measured by available monthly returns if the\nstock has at least 2.5 years of monthly returns or by the\naverage volatility of stocks in the same sector in the\nInvestment Universe if the stock has fewer than 2.5 years\nof monthly returns. For each sector, stocks with the lowest\nvolatility whose combined free float sector market\ncapitalization equals 30% are selected for inclusion in the\nIndex, including the first stock that brings the combined\nsector market capitalization above 30%. The Index weights\nconstituent securities such that securities with the lowest\nvolatility receive the highest weights in the Index,\nsubject to liquidity constraints limiting a constituent's\nweighting in the Index to 5% and to 20 times the\nconstituent's weight within the Index Universe. The Index\nrebalance determination date is 10 business days prior to\nthe last business day of March. Index rebalancings are\neffective after the close of the last business day of\nMarch. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nFund comprised companies in the financial sector, although\nthis may change from time to time. As of July 31, 2024,\nthere were 418 securities in the Index. The Index was\ncreated and is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d or \u201cSSGA\u201d), an affiliate of the Fund\nand of SSGA FM, the Fund's Adviser. The Index Provider\nestablishes and maintains rules which are used to determine\nthe composition of the Index and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all investments, there are certain risks\nof investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value,\nand you could lose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. Small-Capitalization Securities Risk: The securities\nof small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and\nmay involve more risk than the securities of larger\ncompanies. These companies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets or financial resources, may lack the competitive\nstrength of larger companies, and may depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition, these companies may have been\nrecently organized and may have little or no track record\nof success. The securities of smaller companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely\nheld securities. Some securities of smaller issuers may be\nilliquid or may be restricted as to resale, and their\nvalues may have significant volatility. The Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any\ntime, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. Returns on investments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the returns on\ninvestments in securities of larger companies. Low\nVolatility Risk: Although subject to the risks of common\nstocks, low volatility stocks are seen as having a lower\nrisk profile than the overall markets. However, a portfolio\ncomprised of low volatility stocks may not produce\ninvestment exposure that has lower variability to changes\nin such stocks' price levels. Low volatility stocks are\nlikely to underperform the broader market during periods of\nrapidly rising stock prices. 7 Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Financial Sector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which may limit both the amounts and types of\nloans and other financial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of\nthe credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in\na broad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. 8\n\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market\nconditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or\nprice or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid investments and may\nbe subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the\nFund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling\nsuch investments, may be unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or sector.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from\nyear to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the\nFund will perform in the future.

Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective December 13, 2016 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Russell 2000 Low Volatility Index (the \u201cPrevious\nBenchmark Index\u201d) to the SSGA US Small Cap Low Volatility Index, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the performance of the current index. Performance of the Fund prior\nto the Benchmark Index Change Date is therefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index and may have been different had the Fund tracked the current index. 9\n                                                                                 \n                                                   OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                              7.47%    9.07%      8.21%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions              6.59%    8.24%      7.07%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of  4.72%    6.93%      6.19%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                    \n  SSGA US Small Cap Low Volatility Index/Russell                                 \n  2000 Low Volatility Index1(reflects no           7.53%    9.28%      8.32%     \n  deductionfor fees, expenses or taxes)                                          \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,   26.29%   15.69%     12.03%    \n  expenses or taxes)                                                             \n                                                                                 \n(1) Returns shown are reflective of the Index for periods beginning on the Benchmark Index Change Date and\nthe Previous Benchmark Index for periods prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date. Portfolio Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio Managers The\nprofessionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Karl Schneider and John\nLaw. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta\nGroup in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. John Law, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and\na Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. He joined the Adviser in 2016. Purchase and\nSale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d\nCreation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca,\nInc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading\nsystems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than\nat net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information\nregarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income,\nqualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-\nadvantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries\nIf you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the\nAdviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund,\nincluding educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting\nsystems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a\nconflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information.\n\n10\n\nAdditional Strategies Information Principal Strategies General . Please see each Fund's \u201cThe Fund's\nPrincipal Investment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund Summaries\u201d above for a discussion of each Fund's\nprincipal investment strategies. A Fund may invest in various types of securities and engage in various\ninvestment techniques which are not the principal focus of the Fund and therefore are not described in this\nProspectus. These securities, techniques and practices, together with their risks, are described in the\nStatement of Additional Information (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain free of charge by contacting\nshareholder services (see the back cover of this Prospectus for the address and phone number). The Adviser\nseeks to track the performance of each Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e ., obtain a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index). A number of factors may affect a Fund's ability to achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with its Index, and there can be no guarantee that a Fund will achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation. For example, a Fund may not be able to achieve a high degree of correlation with its Index when\nthere are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved in compiling a portfolio of securities to\nfollow the Index, when a security in the Index becomes temporarily illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or\nlegal restrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from investing in a security in the Index. The Adviser will\nutilize a sampling strategy in managing the Funds. Sampling means that the Adviser uses quantitative\nanalysis to select securities, including securities in the Index, outside of the Index and derivatives that\nhave a similar investment profile as the relevant Index in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes\nand other economic characteristics. These include industry weightings, market capitalization, and other\nfinancial characteristics of securities. The quantity of holdings in a Fund will be based on a number of\nfactors, including asset size of the Fund. In addition, from time to time, securities are added to or\nremoved from each Index. The Adviser may sell securities that are represented in an Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in an Index, in anticipation of their removal from or addition to an\nIndex. Further, the Adviser may choose to overweight securities in an Index, purchase or sell securities not\nin an Index, or utilize various combinations of other available techniques, in seeking to track an Index.\nThe Board of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change a Fund's investment strategy, Index and other\npolicies without shareholder approval, except as otherwise indicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI. The\nBoard may also change a Fund's investment objective without shareholder approval. Non-Principal Strategies\nCertain Other Investments . Each Fund may invest in structured notes (notes on which the amount of principal\nrepayment and interest payments are based on the movement of one or more specified factors such as the\nmovement of a particular security or index), swaps and options contracts. Swaps and options contracts and\nstructured notes may be used by a Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to its Index and in managing\ncash flows. Temporary Defensive Positions . In certain situations or market conditions, a Fund may\ntemporarily depart from its normal investment policies and strategies, provided that the alternative is\nconsistent with the Fund's investment objective and is in the best interest of the Fund. For example, a Fund\nmay make larger than normal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure to its Index if it is unable to\ninvest directly in a component security. Borrowing Money . Each Fund may borrow money from a bank as\npermitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing statute, by the\nrules thereunder, or by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund, but only for temporary or emergency purposes. The 1940 Act presently allows a Fund\nto borrow from any bank (including pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3%\nof its total assets (not including temporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of its total assets). A Fund may\nalso invest in reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions. Consistent with a rule under\nthe 1940 Act, a Fund may treat such investments as either borrowings or derivatives transactions. To the\nextent a Fund treats reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions as borrowings, such\ninvestments will also be included in the 33 1/3% limit. Under normal circumstances, any borrowings by a Fund\n(including investments in reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions treated as\nborrowings) will not exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets . 11\n\nLending of Securities . Each Fund may lend its portfolio securities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the\nvalue of its net assets via a securities lending program through its securities lending agent, State Street\nBank and Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d or the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers, dealers and other financial\ninstitutions desiring to borrow securities to complete transactions and for other purposes. A securities\nlending program allows a Fund to receive a portion of the income generated by lending its securities and\ninvesting the respective collateral. A Fund will receive collateral for each loaned security which is at\nleast equal to the market value of that security, marked to market each trading day. To the extent a Fund\nreceives cash collateral, as of the date of this Prospectus, the Adviser expects to invest such cash\ncollateral in a fund managed by the Adviser that invests in: a broad range of money market instruments;\ncertificates of deposit and time deposits of U.S. and foreign banks; commercial paper and other high quality\nobligations of U.S. or foreign companies; asset-backed securities; mortgage-related securities; repurchase\nagreements; and shares of money market funds. With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the\nborrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. A Fund is compensated by\nthe difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the\nborrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. In the securities lending program, the\nborrower generally has the right to vote the loaned securities; however, a Fund may call loans to vote\nproxies if a material issue affecting the Fund's economic interest in the investment is to be voted upon.\nSecurity loans may be terminated at any time by a Fund.

A Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties with which the\nFund enters into derivatives contracts and other transactions such as repurchase agreements or reverse\nrepurchase agreements. A Fund's ability to profit from these types of investments and transactions will\ndepend on the willingness and ability of its counterparty to perform its obligations. If a counterparty\nfails to meet its contractual obligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund. A Fund may experience significant delays in\nobtaining any recovery in an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any collateral posted by it) and may obtain only a limited recovery or\nmay obtain no recovery in such circumstances. If a Fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty, it may\nbe delayed or prevented from realizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding relating to the counterparty. Under applicable law or contractual provisions, including if a Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with a financial institution and such financial institution (or an\naffiliate of the financial institution) experiences financial difficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from exercising its rights to terminate the investment or transaction, or\nto realize on any collateral and may result in the suspension of payment and delivery obligations of the\nparties under such investment or transactions or in another institution being substituted for that financial\ninstitution without the consent of the Fund. Further, a Fund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the financial institution's authority, the financial institution's\nliabilities could be written down, eliminated or converted into equity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial institution may result in a reduction in value of some or all of its\nsecurities and, if a Fund holds such securities or has entered into a transaction with such a financial\nsecurity when a bail-in occurs, such Fund may also be similarly impacted. Derivatives Risk. A derivative is\na financial contract the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset,\ninterest rate, or index. Derivative transactions typically involve leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a derivative transaction will result in a loss greater than the principal\namount invested, and a Fund may not be able to close out a derivative transaction at a favorable time or\nprice. Risks associated with derivative instruments include potential changes in value in response to\ninterest rate changes or other market developments or as a result of the counterparty's credit quality; the\npotential for the derivative transaction not to have the effect the Adviser anticipated or a different or\nless favorable effect than the Adviser anticipated; the failure of the counterparty to the derivative\ntransaction to perform its obligations under the transaction or to settle a trade; possible mispricing or\nimproper valuation of the derivative instrument; imperfect correlation in the value of a derivative with the\nasset, rate, or index underlying the derivative; the risk that a Fund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, 13\n\nand will not be able to recover the collateral or margin in the event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will experience losses on its derivatives investments and on its other\nportfolio investments, even when the derivatives investments may be intended in part or entirely to hedge\nthose portfolio investments; the risks specific to the asset underlying the derivative instrument; lack of\nliquidity for the derivative instrument, including, without limitation, absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to a Fund due to losses on the transaction and an increase in\nvolatility; the potential for the derivative transaction to have the effect of accelerating the recognition\nof gain; and legal risks arising from the documentation relating to the derivative transaction. Futures\nContract Risk . The risk of loss relating to the use of futures contracts is potentially unlimited. The\nability to establish and close out positions in futures contracts will be subject to the development and\nmaintenance of a liquid secondary market. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an\nexchange will exist for any particular futures contract or at any particular time. In the event no such\nmarket exists, it might not be possible to effect closing transactions, and a Fund will be unable to\nterminate the futures contract. In using futures contracts, a Fund will be reliant on the ability of the\nAdviser to predict market and price movements correctly; the skills needed to use such futures contracts\nsuccessfully are different from those needed for traditional portfolio management. If a Fund uses futures\ncontracts for hedging purposes, there is a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of\nthe futures contracts and movements in the securities or index underlying the futures contracts or movements\nin the prices of the Fund's investments that are the subject of such hedge. The prices of futures contracts,\nfor a number of reasons, may not correlate perfectly with movements in the securities or index underlying\nthem. For example, participants in the futures markets are subject to margin deposit requirements. Such\nrequirements may cause investors to take actions with respect to their futures positions that they would not\notherwise take. The margin requirements in the futures markets may be less onerous than margin requirements\nin the securities markets in general, and as a result those markets may attract more speculators than the\nsecurities markets do. Increased participation by speculators in those markets may cause temporary price\ndistortions. Due to the possibility of price distortion, even a correct forecast of general market trends by\nthe Adviser still may not result in a successful futures activity over a very short time period. The risk of\na position in a futures contract may be very large compared to the relatively low level of margin a Fund is\nrequired to deposit. A Fund will typically be required to post margin with its futures commission merchant\nin connection with its transactions in futures contracts. In many cases, a relatively small price movement\nin a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to the\nsize of a required margin deposit. A Fund will incur brokerage fees in connection with its futures\ntransactions. In the event of an insolvency of the futures commission merchant or a clearing house, a Fund\nmay not be able to recover all (or any) of the margin it has posted with the futures commission merchant, or\nto realize the value of any increase in the price of its positions, or it may experience a significant delay\nin doing so. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have\nestablished limits referred to as \u201cspeculative position limits\u201d on the maximum net long or net short\npositions that any person and certain affiliated entities may hold or control in a particular futures\ncontract. In addition, federal position limits apply to swaps that are economically equivalent to futures\ncontracts that are subject to CFTC-set speculative limits. All positions owned or controlled by the same\nperson or entity, even if in different accounts, must be aggregated for purposes of complying with position\nlimits. It is possible that the positions of different clients managed by the Adviser may be aggregated for\nthis purpose. Therefore, the trading decisions of the Adviser may have to be modified and positions held by\na Fund liquidated in order to avoid exceeding such limits. The modification of investment decisions or the\nelimination of open positions, if it occurs, may adversely affect the performance of a Fund. A violation of\nposition limits could also lead to regulatory action materially adverse to a Fund's investment strategy. In\naddition, exchanges may establish accountability levels applicable to a futures contract instead of position\nlimits, provided that the futures contract is not subject to federal position limits. An exchange may order\na person who holds or controls a position in excess of a position accountability level not to further\nincrease its position, to comply with any prospective limit that exceeds the size of the position owned or\ncontrolled, or to reduce any open position that exceeds the position accountability level if the exchange\ndetermines that such action is necessary to maintain an orderly market. Position accountability levels could\nadversely affect a Fund's ability to establish and maintain positions in commodity futures contracts to\nwhich such levels apply, if the Fund were to trade in such contracts, and a Fund's ability to achieve its\ninvestment objective. Futures contracts traded on markets outside the U.S. are not generally subject to the\nsame level of regulation by the CFTC or other U.S. regulatory entities as contracts traded in the U.S.,\nincluding without limitation as to the execution, delivery, and clearing of transactions. U.S. regulators\nneither regulate the activities of a foreign 14 exchange, nor have the power to compel enforcement of the\nrules of the foreign exchange or the laws of the foreign country in question. Margin and other payments made\nby a Fund may not be afforded the same protections as are afforded those payments in the U.S., including in\nconnection with the insolvency of an executing or clearing broker or a clearinghouse or exchange. Certain\nforeign futures contracts may be less liquid and more volatile than U.S. contracts. Equity Investing Risk .\nThe market prices of equity securities owned by a Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that may directly relate to the\nissuer, such as management performance, financial leverage, non-compliance with regulatory requirements, and\nreduced demand for the issuer's goods or services. The values of equity securities also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company, such as\nreal or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings,\nchanges in interest or currency rates, or adverse investor sentiment generally. In addition, equity markets\ntend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time.\nFinancial Sector Risk. Financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which\nmay limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, the interest\nrates and fees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause an unusually\nhigh degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain financial\nservices companies to incur large losses. Securities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the valuations of their\nassets, take action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or cease\noperations. Credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can negatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be subject to severe\nprice competition. Adverse economic, business or political developments could adversely affect financial\ninstitutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk .\nThe net asset value of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of a Fund's\nsecurities holdings. The market prices of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in\na Fund's net asset value and supply and demand of Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be predicted\nwhether Fund Shares will trade below, at or above their net asset value. Price differences may be due, in\nlarge part, to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the\nsecurities of an Index trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in time. The market prices of\nFund Shares may deviate significantly from the net asset value of Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units (unlike shares of\nmany closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to,\ntheir net asset value), the Adviser believes that large discounts or premiums to the net asset value of Fund\nShares should not be sustained over long periods. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make\nit likely that Fund Shares normally will trade close to a Fund's net asset value, disruptions to creations\nand redemptions or market volatility may result in trading prices that differ significantly from such Fund's\nnet asset value. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time when the market price is at a premium to the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a time when the market price is at a discount to the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares, then the investor may sustain losses. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk . Each\nFund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged\nindex of securities. Each Fund will seek to provide investment results that correspond generally to the\nperformance of the Index, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. Each Fund generally will buy and will not sell a security included in the\nIndex as long as the security is part of the Index regardless of any sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the security, even though the Adviser may make a different\ninvestment decision for other actively managed accounts or portfolios that hold the security. As a result, a\nFund's performance may be less favorable than 15 that of a portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Index (in absolute terms and by comparison with other indices) and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on a Fund and its\nshareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, an Index may include, and the\ncorresponding Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not align with\nthe Index's objective and/or criteria. While the Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index (i.e.,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), a Fund's return may not match the return of the Index\nfor a number of reasons. For example, the return on the sample of securities purchased by a Fund (or the\nreturn on securities not included in the Index) may not correlate precisely with the return of the Index.\nEach Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in buying and\nselling securities. In addition, a Fund may not be fully invested at times, either as a result of cash flows\ninto or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between a Fund's return and that of\nthe Index. Changes in the composition of the Index and regulatory requirements also may impact a Fund's\nability to match the return of the Index. The Adviser may apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment\ntechniques to refine or limit the number or types of issuers included in the Index in which a Fund may\ninvest. Application of such screens or techniques may result in investment performance below that of the\nIndex and may not produce results expected by the Adviser. Index tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Pursuant to each Index methodology,\na security may be removed from an Index in the event that it does not comply with the eligibility\nrequirements of the Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced to sell securities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the Index components. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of an Index and the corresponding Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio\nto attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund's portfolio and the Index, any transaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders.\nUnscheduled changes to an Index may expose the corresponding Fund to additional tracking error risk. A Fund\nmay recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect changes\nin the securities included in the corresponding Index. A Fund also may be required to distribute any such\ngains to its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax consequences. Industrial Sector Risk .\nIndustrial companies are affected by supply and demand both for their specific product or service and for\nindustrial sector products and services in general. Government regulation, world events, exchange rates and\neconomic conditions, technological developments and liabilities for environmental damage and general civil\nliabilities will likewise affect the performance of these companies. Aerospace and defense companies, a\ncomponent of the industrial sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because\ncompanies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and foreign government demand for\ntheir products and services. Thus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by governmental defense spending policies which are typically under\npressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other) government budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have occasional sharp price movements which may result\nfrom changes in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and insurance costs. Large-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk. Securities issued by large-capitalization companies may present risks not present in\nsmaller companies. For example, larger companies may be unable to respond as quickly as smaller and mid-\nsized companies to competitive challenges or to changes in business, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able to maintain growth at the high rates that may be achieved by\nwell-managed smaller and mid-sized companies, especially during strong economic periods. Returns on\ninvestments in securities of large companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of smaller\nand mid-sized companies. Leveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions, reverse repurchase agreements, certain\nderivatives transactions, securities lending transactions and other investment transactions such as when-\nissued, delayed-delivery, or forward commitment transactions may create investment leverage. If a Fund\nengages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund's investment portfolio, the value of the\nFund will be potentially more volatile and all other risks will tend to be 16 compounded. This is because\nleverage generally creates investment risk with respect to a larger base of assets than a Fund would\notherwise have and so magnifies the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to be a speculative investment practice and may result in losses\nto a Fund. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to\ndo so to satisfy repayment, interest payment, or margin obligations or to meet asset coverage requirements.\nLiquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk that a Fund may not be able to dispose of investments readily at\na favorable time or prices (or at all) or at prices approximating those at which a Fund currently values\nthem. For example, certain investments may be subject to restrictions on resale, may trade in the over-the-\ncounter market or in limited volume, or may not have an active trading market. Illiquid investments may\ntrade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in\nmarket value. It may be difficult for a Fund to value illiquid investments accurately. The market for\ncertain investments may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions independent of any\nspecific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer. If the liquidity of a Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net asset value of\nFund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Disposal of illiquid investments may\nentail registration expenses and other transaction costs that are higher than those for liquid investments.\nA Fund may seek to borrow money to meet its obligations (including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of illiquid investments, resulting in borrowing expenses and\npossible leveraging of the Fund. Low Volatility Risk. Although subject to the risks of common stocks, low\nvolatility stocks are seen as having a lower risk profile than the overall markets. However, a portfolio\ncomprised of low volatility stocks may not produce investment exposure that has lower variability to changes\nin such stocks' price levels. Low volatility stocks are likely to underperform the broader market during\nperiods of rapidly rising stock prices. Market Risk . Market prices of investments held by a Fund will go up\nor down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. A Fund's investments are subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile, and prices of investments can change substantially due to various\nfactors, including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers and general market liquidity. Even if general\neconomic conditions do not change, the value of an investment in a Fund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the Fund invests do not perform well or are adversely affected by\nevents. Further, legal, political, regulatory and tax changes also may cause fluctuations in markets and\nsecurities prices. Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism,\nnatural disasters, public health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments. Due to the interconnectedness of economies and financial markets throughout the world, whether\nor not a Fund invests in securities of issuers located in or with significant exposure to countries\nexperiencing economic and financial difficulties, the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments may be\nnegatively affected. A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as COVID-19, and efforts to\ncontain its spread, may result in market volatility, inflation, reduced liquidity of certain instruments,\ndisruption in the trading of certain instruments, and systemic economic weakness. The foregoing could impact\na Fund and its investments and result in disruptions to the services provided to a Fund by its service\nproviders. Additionally, in March 2023, the shutdown of certain financial institutions raised economic\nconcerns over disruption in the U.S. banking system. There can be no certainty that the actions taken by the\nU.S. government to strengthen public confidence in the U.S. banking system will be effective in mitigating\nthe effects of financial institution failures on the economy and restoring public confidence in the U.S.\nbanking system. Small-Capitalization Securities Risk . The securities of small-capitalization companies may\nbe more volatile and may involve more risk than the securities of larger companies. These companies may have\nlimited product lines, markets or financial resources, may lack the competitive strength of larger\ncompanies, and may depend on a few key employees. In addition, these companies may have been recently\norganized and may have little or no track record of success. The securities of smaller companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities. The prices of these securities may\nfluctuate more sharply than those of other securities, and a Fund may experience some difficulty in\nestablishing or closing out positions in these securities at prevailing market prices. There may be less\npublicly available information about the issuers of these securities or less market interest in these\nsecurities than in the case of larger companies, both of which can cause significant price volatility. Some\nsecurities of smaller issuers may 17 be illiquid or may be restricted as to resale. A Fund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet a Fund's\nobligations. Returns on investments in securities of small-capitalization companies could trail the returns\non investments in securities of larger companies. Unconstrained Sector Risk . A Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more economic sectors or industries, which may change from\ntime to time. When a Fund focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector, financial, economic,\nbusiness, and other developments affecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will have a\ngreater effect on the Fund than if it had not focused its assets in that industry, market, or economic\nsector, which may increase the volatility of the Fund. Valuation Risk . Certain portfolio holdings may be\nvalued on the basis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in\ntime might differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using\nmarket quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were used. Technological issues or other service disruption issues\ninvolving third-party service providers may cause a Fund to value its investments incorrectly. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that a Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for\nit at any time, and it is possible that a Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or\nclosed out at a discount to the valuation established by a Fund at that time. Non-Principal Risks Each risk\ndiscussed below is a non-principal risk of a Fund to the extent it is not identified as a principal risk for\nsuch Fund in the preceding \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION - PRINCIPAL RISKS\u201d section. Authorized Participants,\nMarket Makers and Liquidity Providers Concentration Risk. A Fund has a limited number of financial\ninstitutions that may act as Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are responsible for the creation and\nredemption activity for a Fund. In addition, there may be a limited number of market makers and/or liquidity\nproviders in the marketplace. To the extent either of the following events occur, Fund Shares may trade at a\nmaterial discount to NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit the business or otherwise become unable\nto process creation and/or redemption orders and no other APs step forward to perform these services, or\n(ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers exit the business or significantly reduce their business\nactivities and no other entities step forward to perform their functions. Concentration Risk. A Fund's\nassets may be concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to the extent that the Fund's\nunderlying Index concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries. When a Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect on the Fund than\nif it had not focused its assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may increase the\nvolatility of the Fund. Conflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a Fund will be subject to a number of\nactual or potential conflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser or its affiliates may provide services\nto a Fund, such as securities lending agency services, custodial, administrative, bookkeeping, and\naccounting services, transfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities brokerage services, and other\nservices for which the Fund would compensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest in\nother pooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise affiliated with the Adviser. There is no\nassurance that the rates at which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its affiliates, or the\nterms on which it enters into transactions with the Adviser or its affiliates will be the most favorable\navailable in the market generally or as favorable as the rates the Adviser or its affiliates make available\nto other clients. Because of its financial interest, the Adviser will have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of a Fund with itself or its affiliates in circumstances where it\nmight not have done so in the absence of that interest, provided that the Adviser will comply with\napplicable regulatory requirements. The Adviser and its affiliates serve as investment adviser to other\nclients and may make investment decisions that may be different from those that will be made by the Adviser\non behalf of the Funds. For example, the Adviser may provide asset allocation advice to some clients that\nmay include a recommendation to invest in or redeem from particular issuers while not providing that same\nrecommendation to all clients invested in the same or similar issuers. The 18 Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to purchase (or sell) investments for a Fund and to sell (or\npurchase) the same investment for accounts, funds, or structured products for which it serves as asset\nmanager, or for other clients or affiliates. The Adviser and its affiliates may invest for clients in\nvarious securities that are senior, pari passu or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to,\nthe securities that are owned by a Fund. The Adviser or its affiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material nonpublic confidential information that may restrict the Adviser\nfrom purchasing securities or selling securities for itself or its clients (including the Funds) or\notherwise using such information for the benefit of its clients or itself. The foregoing does not purport to\nbe a comprehensive list or complete explanation of all potential conflicts of interests which may affect a\nFund. A Fund may encounter circumstances, or enter into transactions, in which conflicts of interest that\nare not listed or discussed above may arise. Costs of Buying and Selling Shares . Investors buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by\nbrokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a\nsignificant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of Fund Shares.\nIn addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the difference between the price that an\ninvestor is willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which an investor is willing\nto sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as the\n\u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time for Fund Shares based on trading volume\nand market liquidity, and is generally lower if Fund Shares have more trading volume and market liquidity\nand higher if Fund Shares have little trading volume and market liquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling Fund Shares, including\nbid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Fund Shares may significantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small\ninvestments. Cybersecurity Risk . With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the\ndependence on computer systems to perform business and operational functions, funds (such as the Funds) and\ntheir service providers (including the Adviser) may be prone to operational and information security risks\nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or technological malfunctions. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions may have\nincreased the scale and sophistication of deliberate cybersecurity attacks, particularly those from nation-\nstates or from entities with nation-state backing. In general, cyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects. Cyber-attacks include, among others, stealing or corrupting\ndata maintained online or digitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information without authorization, and causing operational disruption.\nSuccessful cyber-attacks against, or security breakdowns of, a Fund, the Adviser or a custodian, transfer\nagent, or other affiliated or third-party service provider may adversely affect a Fund or its shareholders.\nFor instance, cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may interfere with the processing of shareholder or\nother transactions, affect a Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the release of private shareholder\ninformation or confidential Fund information, impede trading, cause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial losses, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and\nadditional compliance costs. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may render records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and other data integral to the functioning of a Fund\ninaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. A Fund may also incur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund and its shareholders could be\nnegatively impacted as a result. While the Adviser has established business continuity plans and systems\ndesigned to minimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the use of technology, processes and controls, there\nare inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not\nbeen identified, given the evolving nature of this threat. Each Fund relies on third-party service providers\nfor many of its day-to-day operations, and will be subject to the risk that the protections and protocols\nimplemented by those service providers will be ineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-attack. The\nAdviser does not control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Adviser or the\nFunds. Similar types of cybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions also are present for issuers of\nsecurities in which each Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers,\nand may cause a Fund's investment in such securities to lose value. Index Construction Risk . A security\nincluded in an Index may not exhibit the characteristic or provide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently a Fund's holdings may not exhibit returns consistent with that characteristic or\nexposure. 19 Index Licensing Risk . It is possible that the license under which the Adviser or a Fund is\npermitted to replicate or otherwise use an Index will be terminated or may be disputed, impaired or cease to\nremain in effect. In such a case, the Adviser may be required to replace the relevant Index with another\nindex which it considers to be appropriate in light of the investment strategy of a Fund. The use of any\nsuch substitute index may have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. In the event that the Adviser is\nunable to identify a suitable replacement for the relevant Index, it may determine to terminate a Fund.\nMoney Market Fund Investment Risk . An investment in a money market fund is not a deposit of any bank and is\nnot insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Certain money market funds seek to\npreserve the value of their shares at $1.00 per share, although there can be no assurance that they will do\nso, and it is possible to lose money by investing in such a money market fund. A major or unexpected change\nin interest rates or a decline in the credit quality of an issuer or entity providing credit support, an\ninactive trading market for money market instruments, or adverse market, economic, industry, political,\nregulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions could cause the share price of such a money market fund to\nfall below $1.00. It is possible that such a money market fund will issue and redeem shares at $1.00 per\nshare at times when the fair value of the money market fund's portfolio per share is more or less than\n$1.00. None of State Street Corporation, State Street, State Street Global Advisors (\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or\ntheir affiliates (\u201cState Street Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an investment in a money market fund at\n$1.00 per share. Investors should have no expectation of capital support to a money market fund from State\nStreet Entities. Other money market funds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV that will fluctuate along\nwith changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV may be worth\nmore or less than their original purchase price. Recent changes in the regulation of money market funds may\naffect the operations and structures of money market funds. A money market fund may be permitted or required\nto impose redemption fees during times of market stress. Portfolio Turnover Risk . A Fund may engage in\nfrequent trading of its portfolio securities. Fund turnover generally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to a Fund, including, for example, brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and\nbid/asked spreads, and transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover have the effect of reducing a Fund's investment return, and\nthe sale of securities by the Fund may result in the realization of taxable capital gains, including short-\nterm capital gains. A Fund may engage in significant trading of its portfolio securities in connection with\nIndex rebalancing. Frequent or significant trading may cause a Fund to incur additional transaction costs\nand experience different tax consequences in comparison to an ETF that does not engage in frequent or\nsignificant trading. Regulatory Risk. Governmental and regulatory actions may have unexpected or adverse\nconsequences on particular markets, strategies, or investments, which may adversely impact a Fund and impair\nhow it is managed. Policy and legislative changes in the United States and in other countries may affect\naspects of financial regulation, and may in some instances contribute to decreased liquidity and increased\nvolatility in the financial markets. The impact of these changes on the markets, and the practical\nimplications for market participants, may not be fully known for some time. Securities Lending Risk. Each\nFund may lend portfolio securities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For these\npurposes, net assets shall exclude the value of all assets received as collateral for the loan. Such loans\nmay be terminated at any time. Any such loans must be continuously secured by collateral maintained on a\ncurrent basis in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned by a Fund, marked to\nmarket each trading day. A Fund will receive the amount of all dividends, interest and other distributions\non the loaned securities; however, the borrower has the right to vote the loaned securities. A Fund will\ncall loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to\nrecall such securities promptly may be unsuccessful, especially for foreign securities or thinly traded\nsecurities. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. Should the borrower of the\nsecurities fail financially, a Fund may experience delays in recovering the securities or exercising its\nrights in the collateral. Loans are made only to borrowers that are deemed by the securities lending agent\nto be of good financial standing. In a loan transaction, a Fund will also bear the risk of any decline in\nvalue of securities provided as collateral or acquired with cash collateral. Each Fund will attempt to\nminimize this risk by limiting the investment of cash collateral to high quality instruments of short\nmaturity either directly on behalf of the lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or funds, which\nmay include those managed by the Adviser. To the extent the collateral provided or investments made with\ncash collateral differ from securities included in an Index, such collateral or investments may have a\ngreater risk of loss than the securities included in the Index. In addition, a Fund 20\n\nwill be subject to the risk that any income generated by lending its securities or reinvesting cash\ncollateral is lower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when overseeing a Fund's securities\nlending activity. Trading Issues . Although Fund Shares are listed for trading on the Exchange and may be\nlisted or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the Exchange, there can be no assurance\nthat an active trading market for such Fund Shares will develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund Shares on\nthe Exchange may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make\ntrading in Fund Shares inadvisable. In addition, trading in Fund Shares on the Exchange is subject to\ntrading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d rules.\nSimilar to the shares of operating companies listed on a stock exchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility in the trading price of the Fund's shares. While\neach Fund expects that the ability of Authorized Participants to create and redeem Fund Shares at net asset\nvalue should be effective in reducing any such volatility, there is no guarantee that it will eliminate the\nvolatility associated with such short sales. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange\nnecessary to maintain the listing of a Fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged or that Fund\nShares will trade with any volume, or at all, on any stock exchange. Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM\nserves as the investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (\u201cInvestment\nAdvisory Agreement\u201d) between the Trust and the Adviser, and, subject to the oversight of the Board, is\nresponsible for the investment management of each Fund. The Adviser provides an investment management\nprogram for each Fund and manages the investment of each Fund's assets. In addition, the Adviser provides\nadministrative, compliance and general management services to each Fund. The Adviser is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc., which itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation. The Adviser is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.\nThe Adviser and certain other affiliates of State Street Corporation make up SSGA. SSGA is one of the\nworld's largest institutional money managers and the investment management arm of State Street Corporation.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Adviser managed approximately $1.01 trillion in assets and SSGA managed\napproximately $4.37 trillion in assets. The Adviser's principal business address is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. For the services provided to each Fund under the Investment Advisory Agreement, for the\nfiscal year ended June 30, 2024, each Fund paid the Adviser the annual fees based on a percentage of each\nFund's average daily net assets as set forth below:\n                                                          \n  SPDR SSGA US Large Cap Low Volatility Index ETF  0.12%  \n  SPDR SSGA US Small Cap Low Volatility Index ETF  0.12%  \n                                                          \nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all or a portion of its management fee. The Adviser has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount equal\nto any acquired fund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) for each Fund until October 31, 2025. This waiver and/or reimbursement does not provide for the\nrecoupment by the Adviser of any amounts waived or reimbursed. This waiver and/or reimbursement may not be\nterminated prior to October 31, 2025 except with the approval of the Board. The Adviser pays all expenses of\neach Fund other than the management fee, brokerage expenses, taxes, interest, fees and expenses of the\nIndependent Trustees (including any Trustee's counsel fees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees and\nexpenses and other extraordinary expenses. A discussion regarding the Board's consideration of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement is provided in the Funds' Form N-CSR filing with the SEC for the period ended\nJune 30, 2024. SSGA FM, as the investment adviser for the Funds, may hire one or more sub-advisers to\noversee the day-to-day investment activities of the Funds. The sub-advisers are subject to oversight by the\nAdviser. The Adviser and SPDR Series Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) have received an exemptive order from the SEC that\npermits the Adviser, with the approval of the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, of\nthe Trust, to retain and amend existing sub-advisory agreements with unaffiliated investment sub-advisers\nfor a Fund without submitting the sub-advisory agreement to a vote of the Fund's shareholders. The Trust\nwill notify shareholders in the event of any change in the identity of such\n\n21\n\nsub-adviser or sub-advisers. The Adviser has ultimate responsibility for the investment performance of the\nFunds due to its responsibility to oversee each sub-adviser and recommend their hiring, termination and\nreplacement. The Adviser is not required to disclose fees paid to any unaffiliated sub-adviser retained\npursuant to the order. Portfolio Managers.\nThe Adviser manages the Funds using a team of investment professionals. The team approach is used to create\nan environment that encourages the flow of investment ideas. The portfolio managers within each team work\ntogether in a cohesive manner to develop and enhance techniques that drive the investment process for the\nrespective investment strategy. This approach requires portfolio managers to share a variety of\nresponsibilities, including investment strategy and analysis, while retaining responsibility for the\nimplementation of the strategy within any particular portfolio. The approach also enables the team to draw\nupon the resources of other groups within SSGA. Each portfolio management team is overseen by the SSGA\nInvestment Committee. The table below identifies the professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of each Fund:\n                                                                                    \n  Portfolio Managers               Fund                                             \n  Karl Schneider and Juan Acevedo  SPDR SSGA US Large Cap Low Volatility Index ETF  \n  Karl Schneider and John Law      SPDR SSGA US Small Cap Low Volatility Index ETF  \n                                                                                    \nJuan Acevedo is a Vice President of SSGA and the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic\nEquity Beta Group.

The Board oversees generally the operations of the Funds and the Trust. The Trust\nenters into contractual arrangements with various parties, including among others the Funds' investment\nadviser, custodian, transfer agent, and accountants, who provide services to the Funds. Shareholders are not\nparties to any such contractual arrangements or intended beneficiaries of those contractual arrangements,\nand those contractual arrangements are not intended to create in any shareholder any right to enforce them\ndirectly against the service providers or to seek any remedy under them directly against the service\nproviders. This Prospectus provides information concerning the Trust and the Funds that you should consider\nin determining whether to purchase Fund Shares. Neither this Prospectus nor the related SAI is intended, or\nshould be read, to be or give rise to an agreement or contract between the Trust or the Funds and any\ninvestor, or to give rise to any rights in any shareholder or other person other than any rights under\nfederal or state law that may not be waived. Index/Trademark Licenses/Disclaimers Each Fund's Index\n(collectively, the \u201cIndices\u201d) was created and is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d or \u201cSSGA\u201d), an affiliate of the Funds and the Funds' Adviser. SSGA or one or more of its\naffiliates has entered into a license agreement with the Funds pursuant to which the Funds use the Indices\nat no charge. The Index Provider establishes and maintains rules which are used to determine the composition\nof the Index and relative weightings of the securities in the Index. In order to minimize any potential for\nconflicts caused by the fact that SSGA acts as Index Provider and its affiliate acts as Advisor to the\nFunds, SSGA has retained an unaffiliated third party to calculate the Indices (the \u201cCalculation Agent\u201d). The\nCalculation Agent, using the rules-based methodology, will calculate, maintain and disseminate the Indices\non a daily basis. SSGA will monitor the results produced by the Calculation Agent to help ensure that the\nIndices are being calculated in accordance with the rules-based methodology. In addition, SSGA and the\nAdviser have established policies and procedures designed to prevent non-public information about pending\nchanges to the Indices from being used or disseminated in an improper manner. Furthermore, SSGA and the\nAdviser have established policies and procedures designed to prevent improper use and dissemination of non-\npublic information about the Funds' portfolio strategies. The Index Provider has no obligation to take the\nneeds of the Funds or the owners of Funds Shares into consideration in establishing and maintaining the\nIndices. The Index Provider does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or performance of the Indices or\nthe data included therein and shall have no liability in connection with the Indices or Index calculation.\nIndex Calculation Agent. The Indices are calculated by Solactive AG. The Funds are not sponsored, promoted,\nsold or supported in any other manner by Solactive AG, nor does Solactive AG offer any express or implicit\nguarantee or assurance either with regard to the results of using the Indices and/or an Index trade mark or\nan Index price at any time or in any other respect. The Indices are calculated and published by Solactive\nAG. Solactive AG uses its best efforts to ensure that the Indices are calculated correctly. Irrespective of\nits obligations towards the issuer, Solactive AG has no obligation to point out errors in the Indices to\nthird parties including but not limited to investors and/or financial intermediaries of the Funds. Neither\npublication of the Indices by Solactive AG nor the licensing of the Indices or an Index trade mark for the\npurpose of use in connection with the Funds constitutes a recommendation by Solactive AG to invest capital\nin said Funds nor does it in any way represent an assurance or opinion of Solactive AG with regard to any\ninvestment in the Funds.

In addition, you\nmay incur customary brokerage commissions and charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the bid\nand the offered price in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction.\nThe trading prices of Fund Shares will fluctuate continuously throughout trading hours based on market\nsupply and demand rather than the relevant Fund's net asset value, which is calculated at the end of each\nbusiness day. Fund Shares will trade on the Exchange at prices that may be above ( i.e ., at a premium) or\nbelow ( i.e ., at a discount), to varying degrees, the daily net asset value of Fund Shares. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares may deviate significantly from the relevant Fund's net asset value during periods of\nmarket volatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares can be issued and redeemed daily in Creation Units, the\nAdviser believes that large discounts and premiums to net asset value should not be sustained over long\nperiods. The Exchange will disseminate, every fifteen seconds during the regular trading day, an indicative\noptimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to each Fund. The IOPV calculations are estimates of the value\nof each Fund's net asset value per Fund Share. Premiums and discounts between the IOPV and the market price\nmay occur. This should not be viewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset value per Fund Share. The IOPV\nis based on the current market value of the published basket of portfolio securities and/or cash required to\nbe deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit and does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of a\nFund's actual portfolio at a particular point in time. Moreover, the IOPV is generally determined by using\ncurrent market quotations and/or price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market\nintermediaries and valuations based on current market rates. The IOPV may not be calculated in the same\nmanner as the NAV, which (i) is computed only once a day, (ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be subject, in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act,\nto fair valuation at different prices than those used in the calculations of the IOPV. Therefore, the IOPV\nmay not reflect the best possible valuation of a Fund's current portfolio. Neither the Funds nor the Adviser\nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of such\nIOPVs and make no warranty as to their accuracy. The Funds do not impose any restrictions on the frequency\nof purchases and redemptions; however, the Funds reserve the right to reject or limit purchases at any time\nas described in the SAI. When considering that no restriction or policy was necessary, the Board evaluated\nthe risks posed by market timing activities, such as whether frequent purchases and redemptions would\ninterfere with the efficient implementation of a Fund's investment strategy, or whether they would cause a\nFund to experience increased transaction costs. The Board considered that, unlike traditional mutual funds,\nFund Shares are issued and redeemed only in large quantities of shares known as Creation Units, available\nonly from a Fund directly, and that most trading in a Fund occurs on the Exchange at prevailing market\nprices and does not involve the Fund directly. Given this structure, the Board determined that it is\nunlikely that (a) market timing would be attempted by a Fund's shareholders or (b) any attempts to market\ntime a Fund by shareholders would result in negative impact to the Fund or its shareholders. Distributions\nDividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are entitled to your share of the applicable Fund's\nincome and net realized gains on its investments. Each Fund pays out substantially all of its net earnings\nto its shareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d 24 Each Fund may earn income dividends from stocks, interest from\ndebt securities and, if participating, securities lending income. These amounts, net of expenses and taxes\n(if applicable), are passed along to Fund shareholders as \u201cincome dividend distributions.\u201d Each Fund will\ngenerally realize short-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets held for one year\nor less. Net short-term capital gains will generally be treated as ordinary income when distributed to\nshareholders. Each Fund will generally realize long-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or\nexchanges assets held for more than one year. Net capital gains (the excess of a Fund's net long-term\ncapital gains over its net short-term capital losses) are distributed to shareholders as \u201ccapital gain\ndistributions.\u201d Income dividend distributions, if any, are generally distributed to shareholders quarterly,\nbut may vary significantly from period to period. Net capital gains for each Fund are distributed at least\nannually. Dividends may be declared and paid more frequently or at any other time to improve Index tracking\nor to comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\u201cCode\u201d). Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole Fund Shares only if the\nbroker through whom you purchased Fund Shares makes such option available. Distributions which are\nreinvested will nevertheless be taxable to the same extent as if such distributions had not been reinvested.\nPortfolio Holdings Disclosure The Funds' portfolio holdings disclosure policy is described in the SAI. In\naddition, the identities and quantities of the securities held by each Fund are disclosed on the Funds'\nwebsite. Additional Tax Information The following discussion is a summary of some important U.S. federal\nincome tax considerations generally applicable to an investment in a Fund. Your investment in a Fund may\nhave other tax implications. Please consult your tax advisor about federal, state, local, foreign or other\ntax laws applicable to you. Investors, including non-U.S. investors, may wish to consult the SAI tax section\nfor additional disclosure. Taxes on Distributions. In general, your distributions are subject to federal\nincome tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in a Fund. The income\ndividends and short-term capital gains distributions you receive from a Fund will be taxed as either\nordinary income or qualified dividend income. Subject to certain limitations, dividends that are reported by\na Fund as qualified dividend income are taxable to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Any\ndistributions of a Fund's net capital gains are taxable as long-term capital gain regardless of how long you\nhave owned Fund Shares. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced\nrates. Distributions in excess of a Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a\ntax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the applicable Fund's shares, and, in general, as\ncapital gain thereafter. In general, dividends may be reported by a Fund as qualified dividend income if\nthey are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund, which, in general, includes\ndividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and certain foreign corporations ( i.e ., certain foreign\ncorporations incorporated in a possession of the United States or in certain countries with a comprehensive\ntax treaty with the United States, and certain other foreign corporations if the stock with respect to which\nthe dividend is paid is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States), provided\nthat the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and\nhas not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. A dividend generally will not be treated as\nqualified dividend income if the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held by a Fund for\nfewer than 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on which\nsuch share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, for\nfewer than 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date. These holding period\nrequirements will also apply to your ownership of Fund Shares. Holding periods may be suspended for these\npurposes for stock that is hedged. Additionally, income derived in connection with a Fund's securities\nlending activities will not be treated as qualified dividend income. 25 U.S. individuals with income\nexceeding specified thresholds are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on all or a portion of their\n\u201cnet investment income,\u201d which includes taxable interest, dividends and certain capital gains (generally\nincluding capital gain distributions and capital gains realized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This 3.8% tax\nalso applies to all or a portion of the undistributed net investment income of certain shareholders that are\nestates and trusts. Certain tax-exempt educational institutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on net\ninvestment income. For these purposes, certain dividends and capital gain distributions, and certain gains\nfrom the disposition of Fund Shares (among other categories of income), are generally taken into account in\ncomputing a shareholder's net investment income. If you lend your Fund Shares pursuant to securities lending\narrangements you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares are held by the\nborrower) as qualified dividend income. You should consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor to\ndiscuss your particular circumstances. Distributions paid in January, but declared by a Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year, payable to shareholders of record in such a month, may be taxable\nto you in the calendar year in which they were declared. The Funds will inform you of the amount of your\nordinary income dividends, qualified dividend income and capital gain distributions shortly after the close\nof each calendar year. A distribution will reduce a Fund's net asset value per Fund Share and may be taxable\nto you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may\nconstitute a return of capital. Derivatives and Other Complex Securities. A Fund may invest in complex\nsecurities. These investments may be subject to numerous special and complex rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund are treated as ordinary income or capital gain, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to a Fund and/or defer a Fund's ability to recognize losses. In turn, these rules may\naffect the amount, timing or character of the income distributed to you by a Fund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding the application of these rules. Taxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund Shares is generally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if Fund Shares have been held for more than one year and as short-term capital gain or loss if Fund\nShares have been held for one year or less, except that any capital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held for\nsix months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to such Fund Shares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units. A person who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units generally will recognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss will be\nequal to the difference between the market value of the Creation Units at the time and the exchanger's\naggregate basis in the securities surrendered plus any cash paid for the Creation Units. A person who\nexchanges Creation Units for securities will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the exchanger's basis in the Creation Units and the aggregate market value of the securities and the\namount of cash received. The Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss realized\nupon an exchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing\n\u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position. Persons\nexchanging securities should consult their own tax advisor with respect to whether wash sale rules apply and\nwhen a loss might be deductible. Under current federal tax laws, any capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the\napplicable Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have been held for more than one year and as a short-term\ncapital gain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have been held for one year\nor less. If you create or redeem Creation Units, you will be sent a confirmation statement showing how many\nFund Shares you purchased or sold and at what price. The Trust on behalf of each Fund has the right to\nreject an order for Creation Units if the purchaser (or a group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the applicable Fund and if, pursuant to\nSection 351 of the Code, the applicable Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market\nvalue of the securities on the date of deposit. The Trust also has the right to require information\nnecessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination. If the Trust 26\ndoes issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a group of purchasers) that would, upon obtaining the Fund\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the applicable Fund, the purchaser (or group\nof purchasers) will not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of securities for Creation Units. If a Fund\nredeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear additional costs and recognize more capital gains than it would\nif it redeems Creation Units in-kind. Non-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income dividends paid by a Fund to\nshareholders who are non-resident aliens or foreign entities will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.\nwithholding tax (other than distributions reported by the Fund as interest-related dividends and short-term\ncapital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty rate applies or unless such income is effectively connected\nwith a U.S. trade or business. In general, a Fund may report interest-related dividends to the extent of its\nnet income derived from U.S.-source interest, and a Fund may report short-term capital gain dividends to the\nextent its net short-term capital gain for the taxable year exceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains on\nthe sale of Fund Shares and dividends that are, in each case, effectively connected with the conduct of a\ntrade or business within the U.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal net income taxation at regular\nincome tax rates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of a Fund's shares\nare urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning special tax rules that may apply to their investment.\nUnless certain non-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply with IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding U.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts with, such\nentities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to distributions payable to such entities. A non-U.S. shareholder\nmay be exempt from the withholding described in this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental\nagreement between the U.S. and a foreign government, provided that the shareholder and the applicable\nforeign government comply with the terms of such agreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund will be required in\ncertain cases to withhold (as \u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has\nprovided the Fund either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, (2) is subject to\nbackup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, (3) has\nfailed to certify to the Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or (4) has not\ncertified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will not be applied to payments that have been subject to the 30%\nwithholding tax on shareholders who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of the United States. Other\nTax Issues. A Fund may be subject to tax in certain states where the Fund does business (or is treated as\ndoing business as a result of its investments). Furthermore, in those states which have income tax laws, the\ntax treatment of the Funds and of Fund shareholders with respect to distributions by the Funds may differ\nfrom federal tax treatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current\nfederal income tax law of an investment in the Funds. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice.\nConsult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in the Funds under\nall applicable tax laws. General Information The Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on\nJune 12, 1998. If shareholders of any Fund are required to vote on any matters, shareholders are entitled to\none vote for each Fund Share they own. Annual meetings of shareholders will not be held except as required\nby the 1940 Act and other applicable law. See the SAI for more information concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization Each Fund is a separate series of the Trust, which is an open-end\nregistered management investment company. From time to time, a Fund may advertise yield and total return\nfigures. Yield is a historical measure of dividend income, and total return is a measure of past dividend\nincome (assuming that it has been reinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither yield nor total return\nshould be used to predict the future performance of a Fund. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel to\nthe Trust, including the Funds. Ernst & Young LLP serves as the independent registered public accounting\nfirm and will audit the Funds' financial statements annually. 27 Financial Highlights These financial\nhighlight tables are intended to help you understand each Fund's financial performance for the past five\nfiscal years or, if shorter, the period since a Fund's inception. Certain information reflects the\nperformance results for a single Fund Share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an\ninvestor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in each Fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends\nand distributions). This information has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the Trust's independent\nregistered public accounting firm, whose report, along with each Fund's financial highlights and financial\nstatements, is included in the Form N-CSR, which is available upon request. Any references to Notes in these\nfinancial highlight tables refer to the \u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d section of each Fund's financial\nstatements, and the financial information included in these tables should be read in conjunction with the\nfinancial statements incorporated by reference in the SAI. 28\n\nSPDR SERIES TRUST FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Selected data for a share outstanding

You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                  \n  Management fees                        0.1345%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None     \n  Other expenses                         0.0011%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.1356%  \n                                                  \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $14        $44     $77     $174  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 0 % of the average value\nof its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\nIn seeking to track the performance of the Bloomberg 1-3\nMonth U.S. Treasury Bill Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes.\n\n4\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of public\nobligations of the U.S. Treasury that have a remaining\nmaturity of greater than or equal to 1 month and less than\n3 months. The Index includes all publicly issued U.S.\nTreasury Bills that have a remaining maturity of less than\n3 months and at least 1 month, and are rated investment-\ngrade. In addition, the securities must be denominated in\nU.S. dollars and must have a fixed rate. The Index is\nmarket capitalization weighted, with securities held in the\nFederal Reserve System Open Market Account (the portfolio\nof U.S. Treasuries, Federal Agency securities, and foreign\ncurrency investments held by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank)\ndeducted from the total amount outstanding. Securities in\nthe Index are updated on the last business day of each\nmonth. As of July 31, 2024, there were approximately 18\nsecurities in the Index. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other fixed income securities\nin their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and\nother characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to\nthe financial condition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be\ntimes when the market price of the shares is more than the\nnet asset value per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened\nin times of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which 5\ntypically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's performance may be less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the Index will\naffect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index\nand, consequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Securities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or any investments made with cash collateral.\nThese events could also trigger adverse tax consequences\nfor the Fund. To the extent the collateral provided or\ninvestments made with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss than the\nsecurities included in the Index. Valuation Risk: Certain\nportfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors\nother than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio\nholding when market quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio holding at a point\nin time might differ from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market\nprices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price\n\n7\n\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                  \n  Management fees                        0.1345%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None     \n  Other expenses                         0.0011%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.1356%  \n                                                  \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $14        $44     $77     $174  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 0 % of the average value\nof its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\nIn seeking to track the performance of the Bloomberg 3-12\nMonth U.S. Treasury Bill Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. The Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of public obligations\nof the U.S. Treasury that have a remaining maturity of\ngreater than or equal to 3 months and less than 12 months.\nThe Index includes all publicly issued U.S.\n\n9\n\nTreasury Bills that have a remaining maturity of less than\n12 months and at least 3 months, and are rated investment-\ngrade. In addition, the securities must be denominated in\nU.S. dollars and must have a fixed rate. The Index is\nmarket capitalization weighted, with securities held in the\nFederal Reserve System Open Market Account deducted from\nthe total amount outstanding. Securities in the Index are\nreconstituted and rebalanced on the last business day of\neach month. As of July 31, 2024, there were approximately\n24 securities in the Index. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other fixed income securities\nin their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and\nother characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to\nthe financial condition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be\ntimes when the market price of the shares is more than the\nnet asset value per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened\nin times of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\n10 Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Securities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or any investments made with cash collateral.\nThese events could also trigger adverse tax consequences\nfor the Fund. To the extent the collateral provided or\ninvestments made with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss than the\nsecurities included in the Index. Valuation Risk: Certain\nportfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors\nother than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio\nholding when market quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio holding at a point\nin time might differ from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. 11\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.15%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 22 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg 1-10 Year U.S. Government Inflation-Linked Bond\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy,\nwhich means that the Fund is not required to purchase all\nof the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a subset of the securities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nBased on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund either may invest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in substantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the same\nproportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser to\nbe in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index and\nin securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities that comprise\nthe Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are not included in\nthe Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. The Index is designed to measure the performance\nof the inflation protected public obligations of the U.S.\nTreasury commonly known as \u201cTIPS\u201d that have a remaining\nmaturity greater than or equal to 1 year and less than 10\nyears.\n\n14\n\nTIPS are securities issued by the U.S. Treasury that are\ndesigned to provide inflation protection to investors. The\nIndex includes publicly issued TIPS that have at least 1\nyear and less than 10 years remaining to maturity on the\nindex rebalancing date, with an issue size equal to or in\nexcess of $500 million. The total amount outstanding for\neach issue is reflected, there are no adjustments made for\nsums held in the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account\n(SOMA) account. Bonds must be capital-indexed and linked to\na domestic inflation index. The securities must be issued\nby the U.S. Government and must be denominated in U.S.\ndollars and pay coupon and principal in U.S. dollars. New\nbonds/reopening's entering the Index must settle on or\nbefore the index rebalancing date. The Index is rebalanced\non the last business day of each month. As of July 31,\n2024, the Index comprised 33 securities. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other fixed income securities\nin their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and\nother characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to\nthe financial condition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Inflation-Indexed Securities Risk:\nThe principal amount of an inflation-indexed security\ntypically increases with inflation and decreases with\ndeflation, as measured by a specified index. It is possible\nthat, in a period of declining inflation rates, the Fund\ncould receive at maturity less than the initial principal\namount of an inflation-indexed security. Changes in the\nvalues of inflation-indexed securities may be difficult to\npredict, and it is possible that an investment in such\nsecurities will have an effect different from that\nanticipated. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. 15 Income\nRisk: The Fund's income may decline due to falling interest\nrates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the\nFund may call or redeem the securities during periods of\nfalling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying lower interest\nrates. If an obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Securities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or any investments made with cash collateral.\nThese events could also trigger adverse tax consequences\nfor the Fund. To the extent the collateral provided or\ninvestments made with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss than the\nsecurities included in the Index. Valuation Risk: Certain\nportfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors\nother than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio\nholding when market quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio holding at a point\nin time might differ from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. 16\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

James Kramer is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996. Cynthia Moy is a Principal\nof the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n2007. Joanna Madden is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2003. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers)\nonly in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in\nexchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\n\n17\n\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund\nShares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to\naccept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 18\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg Convertible Securities ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Bloomberg Convertible Securities ETF (the  \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results         \n  that,before fees and expenses, correspond           \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index that tracksUnited States convertible          \n  securities markets.                                 \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 30 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg U.S. Convertible Liquid Bond Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the\nFund is not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to the extent\nthat the Index concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries.\n\n19\n\nThe Index is designed to represent the market of U.S.\nconvertible securities, such as convertible bonds and\nconvertible preferred stock. Convertible bonds are bonds\nthat can be exchanged, at the option of the holder or\nissuer, for a specific number of shares of the issuer's\nequity securities. Convertible preferred stock is preferred\nstock that includes an option for the holder to convert to\ncommon stock. The Index components are a subset of issues\nin the Bloomberg Convertible Composite Index. To be\nincluded in the Index, a security must meet the following\nrequirements: (i) have an issue amount of at least $350\nmillion and a par amount outstanding of at least $250\nmillion; (ii) be a non-called, non-defaulted security;\n(iii) have at least 31 days until maturity; (iv) be U.S.\ndollar denominated; and (v) be a registered or a\nconvertible tranche issued under Rule 144A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended. The Index may include\ninvestment grade, below investment grade and unrated\nsecurities. The Index is rebalanced on a monthly basis on\nthe last business day of the month. As of August 31, 2024,\na significant portion of the Fund comprised companies in\nthe technology sector, although this may change from time\nto time. As of July 31, 2024, there were 291 securities in\nthe Index. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Convertible Securities Risk: Convertible\nsecurities may be subordinate to other debt securities\nissued by the same issuer. Issuers of convertible\nsecurities are often not as strong financially as issuers\nwith higher credit ratings. Convertible securities\ntypically provide yields lower than comparable non-\nconvertible securities. Their values may be more volatile\nthan those of non-convertible securities, reflecting\nchanges in the values of the securities into which they are\nconvertible. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. 20 Below\nInvestment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-quality debt\nsecurities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) are considered\npredominantly speculative, and can involve a substantially\ngreater risk of default than higher quality debt\nsecurities. Issuers of lower-quality debt securities may\nhave substantially greater risk of insolvency or bankruptcy\nthan issuers of higher-quality debt securities. They can be\nilliquid, and their values can have significant volatility\nand may decline significantly over short periods of time.\nLower-quality debt securities tend to be more sensitive to\nadverse news about the issuer, or the market or economy in\ngeneral. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S. securities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent investments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have a more\nsignificant impact on the Fund. Certain countries may\ninstitute negative interest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate conditions may be 21\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's susceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity.\nPreferred Stock Risk: Generally, preferred stock holders\nhave no or limited voting rights with respect to the\nissuing company. In addition, preferred stock is generally\nsenior to common stock, but may be subordinated to bonds\nand other debt instruments in a company's capital structure\nand therefore may be subject to greater credit risk than\nthose debt instruments. In the event an issuer of preferred\nstock experiences economic difficulties, the issuer's\npreferred stock may lose substantial value due to the\nincreased likelihood of deferred dividend payments and the\nfact that the preferred stock may be subordinated to other\nsecurities of the same issuer. Further, because preferred\nstocks pay dividends at a fixed rate, their market price\ncan be sensitive to changes in interest rates in a manner\nsimilar to bonds \u2014 that is, as interest rates rise, the\nvalue of preferred stock held by the Fund is likely to\ndecline. In addition, to the extent preferred stocks allow\nholders to convert the preferred stock into common stock of\nthe issuer, their market price can be sensitive to changes\nin the value of the issuer's common stock and, therefore,\ndeclining common stock values may also cause the value of\nthe Fund's investments to decline. Preferred stock often\nhave call features which allow the issuer to redeem the\nsecurity at its discretion. The redemption of a preferred\nstock having a higher than average yield may cause a\ndecrease in the Fund's yield. Restricted Securities Risk:\nThe Fund may hold securities that have not been registered\nfor sale to the public under the U.S. federal securities\nlaws. There can be no assurance that a trading market will\nexist at any time for any particular restricted security.\nLimitations on the resale of these securities may have an\nadverse effect on their marketability, and may prevent the\nFund from disposing of them promptly at reasonable prices.\nThe Fund may have to bear the expense of registering the\nsecurities for resale and the risk of substantial delays in\neffecting the registration. Also, restricted securities may\nbe difficult to value because market quotations may not be\nreadily available, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Technology Sector Risk: Market or economic\nfactors impacting technology companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technological advances could have a major\neffect on the value of the Fund's investments. The value of\nstocks of technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, including competition\nfrom foreign competitors with lower production costs.\nStocks of technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are heavily dependent\non patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from\nyear to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Michael\nBrunell, Christopher DiStefano and Frank Miethe. Michael Brunell, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 1997.\nChristopher DiStefano is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2010. Frank Miethe, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2010. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through\nyour broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\n\n23\n\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information. 24\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg Emerging Markets USD Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets USD Bond ETF    \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment            \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses, correspond   \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index thattracks fixed and floating-rate US         \n  dollar-denominated debt issued by sovereign and     \n  quasi-sovereign emergingmarket issuers.             \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.23%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.23%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $24        $74    $130     $293  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 31 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg Emerging Market USD Sovereign and Sovereign Owned\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy,\nwhich means that the Fund is not required to purchase all\nof the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a subset of the securities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nBased on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund either may invest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in substantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the same\nproportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser to\nbe in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is classified as \u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; however,\nthe Fund may become \u201cnon-diversified\u201d solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or\nmore component securities). When the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may invest a relatively high percentage of\nits assets in a limited number of issuers. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially\nall, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index and in securities that the\nAdviser determines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest\n\n25\n\nin cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments\n(including money market funds advised by the Adviser) for\ncash management purposes. In seeking to track the Index,\nthe Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Swaps and futures contracts (each, a type of\nderivative instrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to its Index and in managing\ncash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of fixed and floating-rate US dollar-\ndenominated debt issued by emerging market sovereigns, as\nwell as government guaranteed emerging market issuers and\n100% government owned emerging market issuers (i.e., quasi-\nsovereign emerging market issuers). An emerging market is a\ncountry that the World Bank Income group classifies as\nlow/middle income or the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nclassifies as a non-advanced country. In addition, the\nIndex Provider (defined below) may classify a country as an\nemerging market based on factors such as investability\nconcerns, the presence of capital controls, and/or\ngeographic considerations. The Index includes bonds of any\ncredit quality with a minimum par amount outstanding of $1\nbillion, a remaining maturity of at least one year and an\noriginal maturity of greater than two and a half years.\nSEC-registered, Rule 144A and Regulation S bonds are each\neligible for inclusion in the Index. As of August 31, 2024,\nthere were approximately 630 securities in the Index. The\nIndex is calculated by the Index Provider (as defined\nbelow) using a capped weighting methodology. At each\nrebalance, each constituent country within the Index is\ncapped at 5% with respect to the total market value of the\nIndex. Any country weight exceeding the 5% limit will be\nredistributed on a pro rata basis to the bonds of all other\ncountries in the Index that are below the 5% cap. The Index\nis rebalanced and reconstituted monthly on the last\nbusiness day of the month. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Non-U.S. Securities Risk: Non-U.S. securities\nare subject to political, regulatory, and economic risks\nnot present in domestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a non-U.S. entity than\nabout a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not\nsubject to accounting, auditing, legal and financial report\nstandards comparable to those in the United States.\nFurther, such entities and/or their securities may be\nsubject to risks associated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market\nvolatility; differing securities 26 market structures;\nhigher transaction costs; and various administrative\ndifficulties, such as delays in clearing and settling\nportfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent investments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have a more\nsignificant impact on the Fund. Certain countries may\ninstitute negative interest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's susceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity.\nEmerging Markets Risk: Risks of investing in emerging\nmarkets include, among others, greater political and\neconomic instability, greater volatility in currency\nexchange rates, less developed securities markets,\nincreased potential for market manipulation, possible trade\nbarriers, currency transfer restrictions, a more limited\nnumber of potential buyers and issuers, an emerging market\ncountry's dependence on revenue from particular commodities\nor international aid, less governmental supervision and\nregulation, unavailability of currency hedging techniques,\ndifferences in auditing and financial reporting standards,\nand less developed legal systems. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as expropriation,\nnationalization, embargo, and acts of war. The securities\nof emerging market companies may trade less frequently and\nin smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market\ndisruptions or substantial market corrections may limit\nvery significantly the liquidity of securities of certain\ncompanies in a particular country or geographic region, or\nof all companies in the country or region. The Fund may be\nunable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any\ntime, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's\nobligations. These risks are generally greater for\ninvestments in frontier market countries, which typically\nhave smaller economies or less developed capital markets\nthan traditional emerging market countries. Sovereign Debt\nObligations Risk: Investments in debt securities issued by\ngovernments or by government agencies and instrumentalities\ninvolve the risk that the governmental entities responsible\nfor repayment may be unable or unwilling to pay interest\nand repay principal when due. Any restructuring of a\nsovereign debt obligation held by the Fund will likely have\na significant adverse effect on the value of the\nobligation. In the event of default of sovereign debt, the\nFund may be unable to pursue legal action against the\nsovereign issuer or to realize on collateral securing the\ndebt. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Below\nInvestment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-quality debt\nsecurities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) are considered\npredominantly speculative, and can involve a substantially\ngreater risk of default than higher quality debt\nsecurities. Issuers of lower-quality debt securities may\nhave substantially greater risk of insolvency or bankruptcy\nthan issuers of higher-quality debt securities. They can be\nilliquid, and their values can have significant volatility\nand may decline significantly over short periods of time.\nLower-quality debt securities tend to be more sensitive to\nadverse news about the issuer, or the market or economy in\ngeneral. Futures Contract Risk: A futures contract is a\nstandardized agreement that calls for the purchase or sale\nof a specific asset at a specific price at a specific\nfuture time, or cash settlement of the terms of the\ncontract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. 27 Income Risk: The Fund's income\nmay decline due to falling interest rates or other factors.\nIssuers of securities held by the Fund may call or redeem\nthe securities during periods of falling interest rates,\nand the Fund would likely be required to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower interest rates. If an obligation\nheld by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest\nthe prepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-Diversification\nRisk: To the extent the Fund becomes \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d the\nFund may hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a\nrelatively small number of issuers, a decline in the market\nvalue of a particular security held by the Fund may affect\nits value more than if it invested in a larger number of\nissuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified funds. The Fund\nmay become non-diversified for periods of time solely as a\nresult of tracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings\nof one or more component securities). Restricted Securities\nRisk: The Fund may hold securities that have not been\nregistered for sale to the public under the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws. There can be no assurance that a trading\nmarket will exist at any time for any particular restricted\nsecurity. Limitations on the resale of these securities may\nhave an adverse effect on their marketability, and may\nprevent the Fund from disposing of them promptly at\nreasonable prices. The Fund may have to bear the expense of\nregistering the securities for resale and the risk of\nsubstantial delays in effecting the registration. Also,\nrestricted securities may be difficult to value because\nmarket quotations may not be readily available, and the\nsecurities may have significant volatility. Swaps Risk: A\nswap is a two-party contract that generally obligates the\nparties to exchange payments based on a specified reference\nsecurity, basket of securities, security index or index\ncomponent. Swaps can involve greater risks than direct\ninvestment in securities because swaps may be leveraged and\nare subject to counterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a\ncounterparty's defaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy),\ncredit risk and pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult\nto value). It may not be possible for the Fund to liquidate\na swap position at an advantageous time or price, which may\nresult in significant losses. 28 Valuation Risk: Certain\nportfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors\nother than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio\nholding when market quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio holding at a point\nin time might differ from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time.\nVariable and Floating Rate Securities Risk: During periods\nof increasing interest rates, changes in the coupon rates\nof variable or floating rate securities may lag behind the\nchanges in market rates or may have limits on the maximum\nincreases in coupon rates. Alternatively, during periods of\ndeclining interest rates, the coupon rates on such\nsecurities will typically readjust downward resulting in a\nlower yield. In addition, investment in derivative variable\nrate securities, such as inverse floaters, whose rates vary\ninversely with market rates of interest, or range floaters\nor capped floaters, whose rates are subject to periodic or\nlifetime caps, or in securities that pay a rate of interest\ndetermined by applying a multiple to the variable rate\ninvolves special risks as compared to investment in a\nfixed-rate security and may involve leverage. Floating rate\nnotes are generally subject to legal or contractual\nrestrictions on resale, may trade infrequently, and their\nvalue may be impaired when the Fund needs to liquidate such\nsecurities. 29\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective October 31, 2024 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Bloomberg Emerging USD Bond Core Index (the \u201cPrevious\nBenchmark Index\u201d) to the Bloomberg Emerging Market USD Sovereign and Sovereign Owned Index, consistent with\na change in the Fund's principal investment strategy to track the performance of the current index.\nPerformance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date is therefore based on the Fund's investment\nstrategy to track the Previous Benchmark Index and may have been different had the Fund tracked the current\nindex.\n                                                                               \n                                                      OneYear  SinceInception  \n  4/7/2021                                                                     \n  Return Before Taxes                                 9.71%    -2.85%          \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 7.35%    -4.75%          \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     5.66%    -2.95%          \n  Fund Shares                                                                  \n  Bloomberg Emerging USD Bond Core Index (reflects    9.92%    -3.37%          \n  no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                    \n  Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no  5.72%    -4.65%          \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                       \n                                                                               \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund.

Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the\n\u201cExchange\u201d), other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading\nsystems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than\nat net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information\nregarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income\nand/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable\nto you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information. 31\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (the        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the price and yield performance of an index that   \n  tracks the U.S.high yield corporate bond market.   \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.40%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.40%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $41       $128    $224     $505  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 33 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg High Yield Very Liquid Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or\n\n32\n\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives, including credit\ndefault swaps and credit default index swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of publicly issued U.S. dollar denominated high\nyield corporate bonds with above-average liquidity. High\nyield securities are generally rated below investment-grade\nand are commonly referred to as \u201cjunk bonds.\u201d The Index\nincludes publicly issued U.S. dollar denominated, non-\ninvestment-grade, fixed-rate, taxable corporate bonds that\nhave a remaining maturity of at least one year, but not\nmore than fifteen years, regardless of optionality; are\nrated high-yield (Ba1/BB+/BB+ or below) using the middle\nrating of Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings\nInc., or S&P Global Ratings, respectively; and have $500\nmillion or more of outstanding face value. To be eligible\nfor inclusion in the Index, a bond must have been issued\nwithin the past five years. Exposure to each eligible\nissuer will be capped at two percent of the Index. In\naddition, securities must be registered, exempt from\nregistration at the time of issuance or issued under Rule\n144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Original\nissue zero coupon bonds, step-up coupons that change\naccording to a predetermined schedule, and payment-in-kind\n(\u201cPIK\u201d) securities and toggle notes paying interest in cash\nare also eligible. In addition, callable fixed-to-floating\nrate and fixed-to-variable bonds are eligible during their\nfixed-rate term only. The Index includes only corporate\ncategories. The corporate categories are Industrial,\nUtility, and Financial Institutions. Securities excluded\nfrom the Index include non-corporate bonds, structured\nnotes, private placements, bonds with equity-type features\n(e.g., warrants, convertibility), floating-rate issues,\nEurobonds, defaulted bonds, partial PIK securities, PIK\nsecurities and toggle notes paying interest in-kind, and\nemerging market bonds. The Index is issuer capped and the\nsecurities in the Index are updated on the last business\nday of each month. As of August 31, 2024, a significant\nportion of the Fund comprised companies in the consumer\ncyclical sector, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, there were 1,108 securities in\nthe Index. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Below Investment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-\nquality debt securities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) are\nconsidered predominantly speculative, and can involve a\nsubstantially greater risk of default than higher quality\ndebt securities. Issuers of lower-quality debt securities\nmay have substantially greater risk of insolvency or 33\nbankruptcy than issuers of higher-quality debt securities.\nThey can be illiquid, and their values can have significant\nvolatility and may decline significantly over short periods\nof time. Lower-quality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or the market\nor economy in general. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be\ntimes when the market price of the shares is more than the\nnet asset value per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened\nin times of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Consumer Cyclical Sector Risk: Companies in the\nconsumer cyclical sector are largely impacted by the\nperformance of the overall global economy, changes in\ninterest rates, fluctuations in supply and demand, and\nchanges in consumer preferences. Success depends heavily on\ndisposable household income and consumer spending. As a\nresult, consumer cyclical companies may be adversely\naffected and lose value quickly in periods of economic\ndownturns. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Restricted\nSecurities Risk: The Fund may hold securities that have not\nbeen registered for sale to the public under the U.S.\nfederal securities laws. There can be no assurance that a\ntrading market will exist at any time for any particular\nrestricted security. Limitations on the resale of these\nsecurities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of\nthem promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund may have to\nbear the expense of registering the securities for resale\nand the risk of substantial delays in effecting the 34\n\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult\nto value because market quotations may not be readily\navailable, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract that\ngenerally obligates the parties to exchange payments based\non a specified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve\ngreater risks than direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk\n(e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be\npossible for the Fund to liquidate a swap position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be\nvalued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from\nyear to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Kyle Kelly, CFA, FRM, is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2007. Bradley\nSullivan, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2015. Ryan Mensching, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and\na Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2024. Purchase and\nSale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d\nCreation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca,\nInc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading\nsystems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than\nat net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information\nregarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income\nand/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable\nto you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information. 36\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg Investment Grade Floating Rate ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Bloomberg Investment Grade Floating Rate   \n  ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment        \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses, correspond   \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index thattracks the market for U.S.                \n  dollar-denominated, investment grade floating rate  \n  notes with maturities greaterthan or equal to one   \n  month and less than five years.                     \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.15%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 40 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg U.S. Dollar Floating Rate Note \u02c2 5 Years Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which\nmeans that the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the\nIndex in approximately the same proportions as the Index,\nas determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to the extent\nthat the Index concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries.\n\n37\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of U.S.\ndollar-denominated, investment grade floating rate notes.\nSecurities in the Index must have a remaining maturity of\ngreater than or equal to one month and less than five\nyears, and have $300 million or more of outstanding face\nvalue. In addition, securities in the Index must be rated\ninvestment grade (Baa3, BBB- or BBB- by Moody's Investors\nService (\u201cMoody's\u201d), S&P Global Ratings or Fitch Ratings\nInc., respectively). The Index consists of debt instruments\nthat pay a variable coupon rate with a fixed spread. The\nIndex may include U.S. registered, dollar denominated bonds\nof non-U.S. corporations, governments and supranational\nentities, as well as securities that are subject to\nrestrictions on resale under the U.S. federal securities\nlaws (\u201crestricted securities\u201d). Excluded from the Index are\nfixed rate bullet bonds, fixed-rate puttable and fixed-rate\ncallable bonds, fixed rate and fixed to floating capital\nsecurities, bonds with equity-linked features (e.g.\nwarrants and convertibles), inflation linked bonds and\nsecuritized bonds. The Index is market capitalization\nweighted and the securities in the Index are updated on the\nlast calendar day of each month. As of August 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised companies in the\nfinancial sector, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, there were 364 securities in the\nIndex. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services\nLimited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Variable and Floating Rate Securities Risk:\nDuring periods of increasing interest rates, changes in the\ncoupon rates of variable or floating rate securities may\nlag behind the changes in market rates or may have limits\non the maximum increases in coupon rates. Alternatively,\nduring periods of declining interest rates, the coupon\nrates on such securities will typically readjust downward\nresulting in a lower yield. In addition, investment in\nderivative variable rate securities, such as inverse\nfloaters, whose rates vary inversely with market rates of\ninterest, or range floaters or capped floaters, whose rates\nare subject to periodic or lifetime caps, or in securities\nthat pay a rate of interest determined by applying a\nmultiple to the variable rate involves special risks as\ncompared to investment in a fixed-rate security and may\ninvolve leverage. Floating rate notes are generally subject\nto legal or contractual restrictions on resale, may trade\ninfrequently, and their value may be impaired when the Fund\nneeds to liquidate such securities. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold\nin the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times 38 when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Financial Sector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which may limit both the amounts and types of\nloans and other financial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of\nthe credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in\na broad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Income Risk: The\nFund's income may decline due to falling interest rates or\nother factors. Issuers of securities held by the Fund may\ncall or redeem the securities during periods of falling\ninterest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to\nreinvest in securities paying lower interest rates. If an\nobligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying\nincome at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. 39 Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk: Non-U.S. securities are subject to\npolitical, regulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less information\npublicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial report standards\ncomparable to those in the United States. Further, such\nentities and/or their securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls; expropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater market volatility; differing\nsecurities market structures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as delays in\nclearing and settling portfolio transactions or in\nreceiving payment of dividends. To the extent underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that\nare closed when the exchange on which the Fund's shares\ntrade is open, there may be deviations between the current\nprice of an underlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed foreign market.\nThese deviations could result in the Fund experiencing\npremiums or discounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Securities traded on foreign\nmarkets may be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities\ntraded domestically. Foreign governments may impose\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Certain countries may\ninstitute negative interest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's susceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity.\nRestricted Securities Risk: The Fund may hold securities\nthat have not been registered for sale to the public under\nthe U.S. federal securities laws. There can be no assurance\nthat a trading market will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Limitations on the resale\nof these securities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of\nthem promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund may have to\nbear the expense of registering the securities for resale\nand the risk of substantial delays in effecting the\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult\nto value because market quotations may not be readily\navailable, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest\na substantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from\nyear to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                                                                    \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                 6.63%    2.53%      1.84%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 4.19%    1.53%      1.07%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     3.89%    1.51%      1.07%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                       \n  Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Floating Rate Note \u02c2 5 Years                                \n  Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses     6.70%    2.78%      2.06%     \n  ortaxes)                                                                          \n  Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no    5.53%    1.10%      1.81%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                            \n                                                                                    \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are David\nMarchetti, Frank Miethe and Christopher DiStefano. David Marchetti, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2013. Frank\nMiethe, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. He joined the Adviser in 2010. Christopher DiStefano is a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2010. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.\n\n41\n\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund\nShares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to\naccept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 42\n\nSPDR \u00ae Bloomberg Short Term High Yield Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Bloomberg Short Term High Yield Bond ETF   \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment            \n  resultsthat, before fees and expenses, correspond   \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index thattracks the U.S. high yield short term     \n  corporate bond market.                              \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.40%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.40%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $41       $128    $224     $505  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 54 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg US High Yield 350mn Cash Pay 0-5 Yr 2% Capped\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy,\nwhich means that the Fund is not required to purchase all\nof the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a subset of the securities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based\non a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nBased on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser\nto be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index and\nin securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities that comprise\nthe Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are not included in\nthe Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or\n\n43\n\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives, including credit\ndefault swaps and credit default index swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of short-term publicly issued U.S. dollar-\ndenominated high yield corporate bonds. High yield\nsecurities are generally rated below investment-grade and\nare commonly referred to as \u201cjunk\u201d bonds. The Index\nincludes publicly issued U.S. dollar denominated, non-\ninvestment-grade, fixed rate, taxable corporate bonds that\nhave a remaining maturity of less than 5 years regardless\nof optionality, are rated between Caa3/CCC-/CCC- and\nBa1/BB+/BB+ using the middle rating of Moody's Investors\nService, Inc., Fitch Ratings Inc., or S&P Global Ratings,\nrespectively, and have at least a $350 million outstanding\npar value. The Index includes only corporate categories.\nThe corporate categories are Industrial, Utility and\nFinancial Institutions. Securities included in the Index\nmay include securities that are subject to restrictions on\nresale under the U.S. federal securities laws (\u201crestricted\nsecurities\u201d). Excluded from the Index are non-corporate\nbonds, structured notes with embedded swaps or other\nspecial features, bonds with equity-type features (e.g.,\nwarrants, convertibility), floating-rate securities and\nsecurities that move from fixed to floating-rate, Emerging\nMarket Bonds, defaulted bonds, original issue zero coupon\nbonds, private placements and payment in kind securities.\nThe Index is issuer-capped and the securities in the Index\nare updated on the index rebalancing date. The securities\nin the Index are updated on the last business day of each\nmonth. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nFund comprised companies in the consumer cyclical sector,\nalthough this may change from time to time. As of July 31,\n2024, there were 1,052 securities in the Index and the\ndollar-weighted average maturity of the securities in the\nIndex was 3.43 years. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Below Investment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-\nquality debt securities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) are\nconsidered predominantly speculative, and can involve a\nsubstantially greater risk of default than higher quality\ndebt securities. Issuers of lower-quality debt securities\nmay have substantially greater risk of insolvency or\nbankruptcy than issuers of higher-quality debt securities.\nThey can be illiquid, and their values can have significant\nvolatility and may decline significantly over short periods\nof time. Lower-quality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or the market\nor economy in general. 44 Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be\ntimes when the market price of the shares is more than the\nnet asset value per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened\nin times of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Consumer Cyclical Sector Risk: Companies in the\nconsumer cyclical sector are largely impacted by the\nperformance of the overall global economy, changes in\ninterest rates, fluctuations in supply and demand, and\nchanges in consumer preferences. Success depends heavily on\ndisposable household income and consumer spending. As a\nresult, consumer cyclical companies may be adversely\naffected and lose value quickly in periods of economic\ndownturns. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Restricted\nSecurities Risk: The Fund may hold securities that have not\nbeen registered for sale to the public under the U.S.\nfederal securities laws. There can be no assurance that a\ntrading market will exist at any time for any particular\nrestricted security. Limitations on the resale of these\nsecurities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of\nthem promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund may have to\nbear the expense of registering the securities for resale\nand the risk of substantial delays in effecting the\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult\nto value because market quotations may not be readily\navailable, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. 45\n\nSwaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract that generally\nobligates the parties to exchange payments based on a\nspecified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve\ngreater risks than direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk\n(e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be\npossible for the Fund to liquidate a swap position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be\nvalued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time.

Bradley Sullivan, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2015. Kyle\nKelly, CFA, FRM, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2007. Ryan Mensching, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and\na Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2024. Purchase and\nSale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d\nCreation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca,\nInc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading\nsystems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than\nat net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information\nregarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income\nand/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable\nto you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information. 47\n\nSPDR \u00ae MarketAxess Investment Grade 400 Corporate Bond ETF\n                                                   \n  Investment Objective                             \n  The SPDR MarketAxess Investment Grade 400        \n  Corporate Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to         \n  provideinvestment results that, before fees and  \n  expenses, correspond generally to the price and  \n  yield performanceof an index that tracks the     \n  investment grade U.S. corporate bond market.     \n                                                   \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                  \n  Management fees                        0.09%    \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None     \n  Other expenses                         0.00%    \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.09%    \n  Less contractual fee waiver1           (0.02)%  \n  Net annual Fund operating expenses     0.07%    \n                                                  \n1 SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (the \u201cAdviser\u201d) has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management\nfee and/or reimburse certain expenses, until October 31, 2025 , so that the net annual Fund operating\nexpenses, before application of any fees and expenses not paid by the Adviser pursuant to the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement, if any, will be limited to 0.07% of the Fund's average daily net assets. The contractual\nfee waiver does not provide for the recoupment by the Adviser of any fees the Adviser previously waived. The\nAdviser may continue the waiver and/or reimbursement from year to year, but there is no guarantee that the\nAdviser will do so and the waiver and/or reimbursement may be cancelled or modified at any time after\nOctober 31, 2025. This waiver and/or reimbursement may not be terminated prior to October 31, 2025 except\nwith the approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees. Example: This Example is intended to help you compare the\ncost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest\n$10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end\nof those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the\nFund's operating expenses remain the same. The Example reflects the Fund's contractual fee waiver and/or\nexpense reimbursement only in the periods for which the contractual fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement\nis expected to continue. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $7         $27     $49     $113  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 73 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nMarketAxess U.S. Investment Grade 400 Corporate Bond Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which\nmeans that the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of\n\n48\n\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to the extent the\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives, including credit\ndefault swaps and credit default index swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of 400 U.S. dollar denominated investment grade\ncorporate bonds with higher-than-average liquidity relative\nto the broader U.S. corporate bond market. In order to be\nincluded in the Index, a bond must have a corporate bond\nclassification from Refinitiv. Bonds included in the Index\nmust also, as of the Index Determination Date (defined\nbelow), (i) be rated investment grade, (ii) be issued in\nthe U.S. by an issuer that is U.S. or non-U.S. domiciled,\n(iii) be U.S. dollar denominated, (iv) have $300 million or\nmore of par amount outstanding, (v) have a remaining\nmaturity of at least 2 years, (vi) have an issue date prior\nto the month of the Index Determination Date (as defined\nbelow), and (vii) have a fixed rate (which includes fixed-\nto-floating rate bonds, provided that such bonds are in\ntheir fixed rate term as of the Index Determination Date\n(as defined below)) or zero percent coupon. The Index\nconsiders investment grade securities to be rated\nBaa3/BBB-/BBB- or higher, using the middle rating of\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc., or\nS&P Global Ratings. If only two of the three agencies rate\nthe security, then the more conservative (lower) rating\nwill be used to determine Index eligibility. If only one of\nthe agencies rates the security, then that rating will be\nused. In addition, in order to be included in the Index,\nbonds must have both bid and offer price Composite+ TM\n(\u201cCP+\u201d) valuations. CP+ is the Index Provider's (defined\nbelow) proprietary algorithmic pricing engine. CP+ analyzes\nindustry and proprietary trading and liquidity data to\nprovide an indication of the bid price and offer price\nvaluations of a bond. If the CP+ pricing algorithm does not\nhave access to enough liquidity inputs for a bond, it will\nnot generate bid and offer price valuations and the bond\nwill not be eligible for inclusion in the Index. Bonds are\nalso screened based on liquidity as measured by their\nRelative Liquidity Score (\u201cRLS\u201d). RLS is the Index\nProvider's proprietary methodology that analyzes industry\nand proprietary trading data to score a bond's liquidity\nrelative to bonds identified by the Index Provider as\nhaving similar risk and return characteristics. A bond's\nRLS ranges from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most liquid, and\nonly bonds with a ten-day average RLS of 7 or higher are\neligible for inclusion in the Index. Bonds that remain\neligible for inclusion in the Index after applying the\nscreens referred to above are then ranked by par value face\namount from highest to lowest. For bonds with the same par\nvalue face amount, ranking is based on the following in\norder of priority: bonds with higher ten-day average RLS,\nearlier issue date, and tighter CP+ bid/offer spread. After\napplying such ranking, the 400 highest-ranked bonds that\ncomply with the following limitations are selected for\ninclusion in the Index and weighted by market value: (1)\nany single issuer is limited to 4% of the weight of the\nIndex and (2) to the extent a sector's weight in the\nMarketAxess U.S. Investment Grade Broad Corporate Bond\nIndex (the \u201cBroad Market Index\u201d) is 5% or greater, a\nsector's weight in the Index is limited to 2.5% above such\nsector's weight in the Broad Market Index. The Index is\nrebalanced and reconstituted monthly after the close of\nbusiness on the last business day of the month (the \u201cIndex\nRebalance Date\u201d) based on determinations made on the fourth\nto last business day preceding the Index Rebalance Date\n(the \u201cIndex Determination Date\u201d). Securities eligible for\ninclusion in the Index include senior and subordinated\ndebt, callable and puttable bonds, Rule 144A securities and\nRegulation S securities. As of August 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised companies in the\nfinancial and industrial sectors, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of July 31, 2024, there were 400\nsecurities in the Index. The Index is sponsored by\nMarketAxess Technologies Inc. (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which\nis not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index\nProvider determines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency. 49\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation, which may limit both the\namounts and types of loans and other financial commitments\nthey can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge,\nthe scope of their activities, the prices they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an\nadverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money markets\ngenerally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets. Certain events in the financial\nsector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in\nthe financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause\ncertain financial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Income Risk: The\nFund's income may decline due to falling interest rates or\nother factors. Issuers of securities held by the Fund may\ncall or redeem the securities during periods of falling\ninterest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to\nreinvest in securities paying lower interest rates. If an\nobligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying\nincome at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or 50 at all, which may have\nan adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Less Experienced Index Provider Risk: The\nIndex was created by and is owned and maintained by the\nIndex Provider. The Index Provider has a limited history of\nexperience as an index provider, which may create\nadditional risks for investing in the Fund. There is no\nassurance that Index data, Index computations or Index\nconstruction will be free from error, or that any such\nerrors will be identified and corrected in a timely manner\nor at all. Limited Track Record Risk: The Fund has a\nlimited track record and there is no assurance that the\nFund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size is small, the\nFund may experience low trading volume, which could lead to\nwider bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain\nconditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could cause elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its\nshareholders. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,\nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on resale may\nlimit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid investments\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in\nmarket value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S. securities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. Foreign governments may impose restrictions on\nthe repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have a more\nsignificant impact on the Fund. Certain countries may\ninstitute negative interest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's susceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity. 51\n\nPortfolio Turnover Risk: Frequent purchases and sales of\nportfolio securities may result in higher Fund expenses and\nmay result in more significant distributions of short-term\ncapital gains to investors, which are taxed to individuals\nas ordinary income. Restricted Securities Risk: The Fund\nmay hold securities that have not been registered for sale\nto the public under the U.S. federal securities laws. There\ncan be no assurance that a trading market will exist at any\ntime for any particular restricted security. Limitations on\nthe resale of these securities may have an adverse effect\non their marketability, and may prevent the Fund from\ndisposing of them promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund\nmay have to bear the expense of registering the securities\nfor resale and the risk of substantial delays in effecting\nthe registration. Also, restricted securities may be\ndifficult to value because market quotations may not be\nreadily available, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Subordinated Debt Risk: The Fund may invest in\ndebt securities that are subordinated to more senior\nsecurities of the issuer. Holders of debt securities that\nare subordinated or \u201cjunior\u201d to more senior securities are\nentitled to payment after holders of more senior\nsecurities. Subordinated debt securities are more likely to\nsuffer a credit loss than non-subordinated securities of\nthe same issuer, may be disproportionately affected by a\ndefault, downgrade or perceived decline in\ncreditworthiness, and may take longer to recover interest\nor principal. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract\nthat generally obligates the parties to exchange payments\nbased on a specified reference security, basket of\nsecurities, security index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment in securities\nbecause swaps may be leveraged and are subject to\ncounterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a counterparty's\ndefaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk\nand pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to value).\nIt may not be possible for the Fund to liquidate a swap\nposition at an advantageous time or price, which may result\nin significant losses. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio\nholdings may be valued on the basis of factors other than\nmarket quotations. This may occur more often in times of\nmarket turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple\nmethods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available. The value\nestablished for any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using a different\nmethodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. Zero-\nCoupon Bond Risk: Zero-coupon bonds usually trade at a deep\ndiscount from their face or par values and are subject to\ngreater market value fluctuations from changing interest\nrates than debt obligations of comparable maturities that\nmake current distributions of interest. Fund Performance\nThe following bar chart and table provide an indication of\nthe risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in\nthe Fund's performance from year to year and by showing how\nthe Fund's average annual returns for certain time periods\ncompare with the average annual returns of the Index and of\na relevant broad-based securities index.

Frank Miethe,\nCFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He\njoined the Adviser in 2010. Bradley Sullivan, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2015. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the\n\u201cExchange\u201d), other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading\nsystems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than\nat net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information\nregarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income\nand/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable\nto you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to\n\n53\n\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the\nbroker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask\nyour salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information. 54\n\nSPDR \u00ae Nuveen Bloomberg High Yield Municipal Bond ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg High Yield Municipal     \n  Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide             \n  investmentresults that, before fees and expenses,  \n  correspond generally to the price and yield        \n  performance of an indexthat tracks the U.S. high   \n  yield municipal bond market and to provide income  \n  that is exempt from federalincome taxes.           \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.35%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 7 % of the average value\nof its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\nIn seeking to track the performance of the Bloomberg\nMunicipal Yield Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, Nuveen Asset Management, LLC (\u201cNuveen Asset\nManagement\u201d or the \u201cSub-Adviser\u201d), the investment sub-\nadviser to the Fund, either may invest the Fund's assets in\na subset of securities in the Index or may invest the\nFund's assets in substantially all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index in approximately the same\nproportions as the Index, as determined by the Sub-Adviser\nto be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index and\nin securities that the Sub-Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities that comprise\nthe Index. Additionally, the Fund intends to invest, under\nnormal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in\ninvestments the income of which is exempt from Federal\nincome tax. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are not included in\nthe Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by SSGA Funds\n\n55\n\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. The Index is\nmarket value-weighted and designed to measure the\nperformance of U.S. dollar-denominated high-yield municipal\nbonds issued by U.S. states, the District of Columbia, U.S.\nterritories and local governments or agencies. The Index\nincludes fully tax-exempt investment grade, non-investment\ngrade (\u201cjunk\u201d) and non-rated bonds, but does not include\ndefaulted securities. Bonds included in the Index may\ninclude private activity bonds, which are typically issued\nby or on behalf of local or state governments for the\npurpose of financing the project of a private user. The\nIndex consists of bonds that are constituents of the\nBloomberg Municipal High Yield Bond Index and Bloomberg\nU.S. Municipal Bond Index as follows: (i) 70% of the Index\nis represented by the constituents of the Bloomberg\nMunicipal High Yield Bond Index, the constituents of which\nare non-rated or rated no higher than Ba1 by Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody's\u201d) or BB+ by Standard &\nPoor's (\u201cS&P\u201d) or Fitch Ratings Inc. (\u201cFitch\u201d); (ii) 20% of\nthe Index is represented by the constituents of the\nBloomberg U.S. Municipal Bond Index that are rated Baa3,\nBaa2, or Baa1 by Moody's or BBB-, BBB, or BBB+ by S&P or\nFitch; and (iii) 10% of the Index is represented by the\nconstituents of the Bloomberg U.S. Municipal Bond Index\nthat are rated A3, A2, or A1 by Moody's or A-, A, or A+ by\nS&P or Fitch. Constituents of the Bloomberg Municipal High\nYield Bond Index must have a total amount outstanding of $3\nmillion or more and be issued as part of a transaction of\nat least $20 million. Constituents of the Bloomberg U.S.\nMunicipal Bond Index must have a total amount outstanding\nof $7 million or more and be issued as part of a\ntransaction of at least $75 million. Only fixed-rate coupon\nbonds (including zero coupon bonds) with a remaining\nmaturity of at least one year and a dated date of January\n1, 1991 or later are eligible for inclusion in the Index.\nSecurities included in the Index may include when-issued\nsecurities, as well as securities that are subject to\nrestrictions on resale under the U.S. federal securities\nlaws (\u201crestricted securities\u201d). The securities in the Index\nrebalance on the last business day of each month. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, there were 18,497 securities in the Index.\nThe Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund, the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Below Investment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-\nquality debt securities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) are\nconsidered predominantly speculative, and can involve a\nsubstantially greater risk of default than higher quality\ndebt securities. Issuers of lower-quality debt securities\nmay have substantially greater risk of insolvency or 56\nbankruptcy than issuers of higher-quality debt securities.\nThey can be illiquid, and their values can have significant\nvolatility and may decline significantly over short periods\nof time. Lower-quality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or the market\nor economy in general. Municipal Obligations Risk: Issuers,\nincluding governmental issuers, may be unable to pay their\nobligations as they come due. The values of municipal\nobligations may be adversely affected by local political\nand economic conditions and developments. In addition, the\nvalues of municipal obligations that depend on a specific\nrevenue source to fund their payment obligations may\nfluctuate as a result of actual or anticipated changes in\nthe cash flows generated by the revenue source or changes\nin the priority of the municipal obligation to receive the\ncash flows generated by the revenue source. Municipal\nobligations may be more susceptible to downgrades or\ndefaults during recessions or similar periods of economic\nstress. In addition, changes in U.S. federal tax laws or\nthe activity of an issuer may adversely affect the tax-\nexempt status of municipal obligations. Loss of tax-exempt\nstatus may cause interest received and distributed by the\nFund to shareholders to be taxable and may result in a\nsignificant decline in the values of such municipal\nobligations. Political Risk: A significant restructuring of\nfederal income tax rates or even serious discussion on the\ntopic in Congress could cause municipal bond prices to\nfall. The demand for municipal securities is strongly\ninfluenced by the value of tax-exempt income to investors.\nLower income tax rates could reduce the advantage of owning\nmunicipals. Private Activity Bonds Risk: Private activity\nbonds are issued by or on behalf of public authorities to\nobtain funds to provide privately operated housing\nfacilities, airport, mass transit or port facilities,\nsewage disposal, solid waste disposal or hazardous waste\ntreatment or disposal facilities and certain local\nfacilities for water supply, gas or electricity. Other\ntypes of private activity bonds, the proceeds of which are\nused for the construction, equipment, repair or improvement\nof privately operated industrial or commercial facilities,\nmay constitute municipal securities, although the current\nfederal tax laws place limitations on the size of such\nissues. The credit and quality of private activity bonds\nare usually related to the credit of the corporate user of\nthe facilities. Payment of interest on and repayment of\nprincipal of such bonds are the responsibility of the\ncorporate user (and/or any guarantor), which means that the\nholder of the private activity bond is exposed to the risk\nthat the corporate user (and/or any guarantor) may default\non the private activity bond. Conditions such as regulatory\nand environmental restrictions and economic downturns may\nlower the need for and the ability of corporate users to\npay for the projects financed by private activity bonds.\nThe Fund's distributions of its interest income from\nprivate activity bonds may subject certain investors to the\nfederal alternative minimum tax applicable to noncorporate\ntaxpayers. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Income\nRisk: The Fund's income may decline due to falling interest\nrates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the\nFund may call or redeem the securities during periods of\nfalling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying lower interest\nrates. If an obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\n57 to its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Sub-Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Sub-Adviser\nmay attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Restricted\nSecurities Risk: The Fund may hold securities that have not\nbeen registered for sale to the public under the U.S.\nfederal securities laws. There can be no assurance that a\ntrading market will exist at any time for any particular\nrestricted security. Limitations on the resale of these\nsecurities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of\nthem promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund may have to\nbear the expense of registering the securities for resale\nand the risk of substantial delays in effecting the\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult\nto value because market quotations may not be readily\navailable, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Tax Exemption Risk: There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund's income will be exempt from federal or state\nincome taxes. Events occurring after the date of issuance\nof a municipal bond or after the Fund's acquisition of a\nmunicipal bond may result in a determination that interest\non that bond is includible in gross income for federal\nincome tax purposes retroactively to its date of issuance.\nSuch a determination may cause a portion of prior\ndistributions by the Fund to its shareholders to be taxable\nto those shareholders in the year of receipt. Federal or\nstate changes in income or alternative minimum tax rates or\nin the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make municipal\nbonds less attractive as investments and cause them to\ndecline in value. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio\nholdings may be valued on the basis of factors other than\nmarket quotations. This may occur more often in times of\nmarket turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple\nmethods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available. The value\nestablished for any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using a different\nmethodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. When-\nIssued Securities Risk: The Fund may purchase securities on\na when-issued or forward commitment basis. The purchase\nprice of such securities is typically fixed at the time of\nthe commitment, with delivery and payment taking place in\nthe future. At the time of delivery of the securities, the\nvalue may be more or less than the purchase or sale price.\nPurchase of securities on a when-issued or forward\ncommitment basis may give rise to investment leverage, and\nmay result in increased volatility of the Fund's net asset\nvalue. Default by, or bankruptcy of, a counterparty to a\nwhen-issued transaction would expose the Fund to possible\nlosses because of an adverse market action, expenses or\ndelays in connection with the purchase or sale of the pools\nspecified in such transaction. Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority, Inc. rules impose mandatory margin\nrequirements for certain types of when-issued or forward\ncommitment transactions, with limited exceptions. Such\ntransactions require mandatory collateralization which may\nincrease the cost of such transactions and impose added\noperational complexity. 58\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective October 1, 2019 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the S&P Municipal Yield Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark\nIndex\u201d) to the Bloomberg Municipal Yield Index, consistent with a change in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of the current index. Performance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index\nChange Date is therefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the Previous Benchmark Index and\nmay have been different had the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                                                                  \n                                                    OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                               7.36%    1.73%      3.78%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions               7.34%    1.71%      3.75%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of   6.09%    2.20%      3.88%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                     \n  Bloomberg Municipal Yield Index/S&P Municipal                                   \n  Yield Index1(reflects no deduction for fees,      8.97%    3.41%      4.86%     \n  expensesor taxes)                                                               \n  Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no  5.53%    1.10%      1.81%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                          \n                                                                                  \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the Index for periods beginning on the Benchmark Index Change Date and the\nPrevious Benchmark Index for periods prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date. Portfolio Management\nInvestment Adviser and Sub-Adviser SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d) serves as the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund. Nuveen Asset Management serves as investment sub-adviser to the Fund,\nsubject to supervision by the Adviser and oversight by the Trust's Board of Trustees. To the extent that a\nreference in this Prospectus refers to the Adviser, with respect to the Fund, such reference should also be\nread to refer to Nuveen Asset Management, where the context requires. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Timothy Ryan and Joel Levy. Timothy T.\nRyan, CFA, is a Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Nuveen Asset Management. Mr. Ryan joined an\naffiliate of Nuveen Asset Management in 2010. Joel H. Levy is a Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at\nNuveen Asset Management. Mr. Levy joined an affiliate of Nuveen Asset Management in 2011.\n\n59\n\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund intends to pay income that is exempt from\nregular federal income tax, but which may be subject to federal alternative minimum tax. A portion of the\nFund's distributions may be subject to such taxes. Income from municipal securities of states other than the\nshareholder's state of residence generally will not qualify for tax-free treatment for such shareholder with\nrespect to state and local taxes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser\nor its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems,\nor other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund\nover another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more\ninformation. 60\n\nSPDR \u00ae Nuveen Bloomberg Municipal Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Municipal Bond ETF (the   \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results         \n  that,before fees and expenses, correspond           \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index that tracksthe U.S. municipal bond market     \n  and provides income that is exempt from federal     \n  income taxes.                                       \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.23%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.23%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $24        $74    $130     $293  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 24 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg Municipal Managed Money 1-25 Years Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, Nuveen Asset Management, LLC\n(\u201cNuveen Asset Management\u201d or the \u201cSub-Adviser\u201d), the\ninvestment sub-adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Sub-\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index and\nin securities that the Sub-Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities that comprise\nthe Index. Additionally, the Fund intends to invest, under\nnormal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in\ninvestments the income of which is exempt from Federal\nincome tax. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are not included in\nthe Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by SSGA Funds\n\n61\n\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. The Index is\ndesigned to track the U.S. fully tax-exempt bond market.\nThe Index includes state and local general obligation\nbonds, revenue bonds, pre-refunded bonds, and insured\nbonds. The Index is comprised of tax-exempt municipal\nsecurities issued by states, cities, counties, districts\nand their respective agencies. A general obligation bond is\nsecured by the full faith and credit of its issuer. A\nrevenue bond is payable from a specific source of revenue.\nA pre-refunded bond is a revenue bond that the issuer has\nallocated funds to fully retire. An insured bond is\nprotected from issuer default or rating downgrade by an\ninsurance company. The Index also includes municipal lease\nobligations, which are securities issued by state and local\ngovernments and authorities to finance the acquisition of\nequipment and facilities. They may take the form of a\nlease, an installment purchase contract, a conditional\nsales contract, or a participation interest in a lease or\ncontract. The Index is a rules-based, market-value weighted\nindex engineered for the tax-exempt bond market. All bonds\nin the Index must be U.S. dollar denominated and rated\nAa3/AA- or higher by at least two of the following\nstatistical ratings agencies: Moody's Investors Service,\nInc., S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch Ratings Inc. If only\ntwo of the three agencies rate the security, the lower\nrating is used to determine index eligibility. If only one\nof the agencies rates the security, the rating must be at\nleast Aa3/AA-. In addition, to be included in the Index, a\nsecurity must meet the following requirements: (i) must be\nfixed rate; (ii) have been issued within the last five\nyears; (iii) have an outstanding par value of at least $7\nmillion and have been issued as part of a transaction of at\nleast $75 million; and (iv) have a remaining maturity of\ngreater than or equal to 1 year and less than 25 years.\nSecurities included in the Index may include when-issued\nsecurities. Bonds subject to alternative minimum tax,\nhospital bonds, housing bonds, tobacco bonds, and airline\nbonds are excluded from the Index. The Index is rebalanced\nmonthly on the last business day of the month. As of July\n31, 2024, there were 20,697 securities in the Index. The\nIndex is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund,\nthe Adviser or the Sub-Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. 62 Municipal Obligations Risk: Issuers,\nincluding governmental issuers, may be unable to pay their\nobligations as they come due. The values of municipal\nobligations may be adversely affected by local political\nand economic conditions and developments. In addition, the\nvalues of municipal obligations that depend on a specific\nrevenue source to fund their payment obligations may\nfluctuate as a result of actual or anticipated changes in\nthe cash flows generated by the revenue source or changes\nin the priority of the municipal obligation to receive the\ncash flows generated by the revenue source. Municipal\nobligations may be more susceptible to downgrades or\ndefaults during recessions or similar periods of economic\nstress. In addition, changes in U.S. federal tax laws or\nthe activity of an issuer may adversely affect the tax-\nexempt status of municipal obligations. Loss of tax-exempt\nstatus may cause interest received and distributed by the\nFund to shareholders to be taxable and may result in a\nsignificant decline in the values of such municipal\nobligations. Political Risk: A significant restructuring of\nfederal income tax rates or even serious discussion on the\ntopic in Congress could cause municipal bond prices to\nfall. The demand for municipal securities is strongly\ninfluenced by the value of tax-exempt income to investors.\nLower income tax rates could reduce the advantage of owning\nmunicipals. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Income\nRisk: The Fund's income may decline due to falling interest\nrates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the\nFund may call or redeem the securities during periods of\nfalling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying lower interest\nrates. If an obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Sub-Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Sub-Adviser\nmay attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. 63\n\nTax Exemption Risk: There is no guarantee that the Fund's\nincome will be exempt from federal or state income taxes.\nEvents occurring after the date of issuance of a municipal\nbond or after the Fund's acquisition of a municipal bond\nmay result in a determination that interest on that bond is\nincludible in gross income for federal income tax purposes\nretroactively to its date of issuance. Such a determination\nmay cause a portion of prior distributions by the Fund to\nits shareholders to be taxable to those shareholders in the\nyear of receipt. Federal or state changes in income or\nalternative minimum tax rates or in the tax treatment of\nmunicipal bonds may make municipal bonds less attractive as\ninvestments and cause them to decline in value. Valuation\nRisk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on the basis\nof factors other than market quotations. This may occur\nmore often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple methods that can be used to value a\nportfolio holding when market quotations are not readily\navailable. The value established for any portfolio holding\nat a point in time might differ from what would be produced\nusing a different methodology or if it had been priced\nusing market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued\nusing techniques other than market quotations, including\n\u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next\nthan if market quotations were used. In addition, there is\nno assurance that the Fund could sell or close out a\nportfolio position for the value established for it at any\ntime, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a\ndiscount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. When-Issued Securities Risk: The Fund may purchase\nsecurities on a when-issued or forward commitment basis.\nThe purchase price of such securities is typically fixed at\nthe time of the commitment, with delivery and payment\ntaking place in the future. At the time of delivery of the\nsecurities, the value may be more or less than the purchase\nor sale price. Purchase of securities on a when-issued or\nforward commitment basis may give rise to investment\nleverage, and may result in increased volatility of the\nFund's net asset value. Default by, or bankruptcy of, a\ncounterparty to a when-issued transaction would expose the\nFund to possible losses because of an adverse market\naction, expenses or delays in connection with the purchase\nor sale of the pools specified in such transaction.\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. rules impose\nmandatory margin requirements for certain types of when-\nissued or forward commitment transactions, with limited\nexceptions. Such transactions require mandatory\ncollateralization which may increase the cost of such\ntransactions and impose added operational complexity. Fund\nPerformance The following bar chart and table provide an\nindication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's performance from year to year and by\nshowing how the Fund's average annual returns for certain\ntime periods compare with the average annual returns of the\nIndex and of a relevant broad-based securities index.

After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective January 2, 2019 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Bloomberg Municipal Managed Money Index (the \u201cPrevious\nBenchmark Index\u201d) to the Bloomberg Municipal Managed Money 1-25 Years Index, consistent with a change in the\nFund's principal 64\n\ninvestment strategy to track the performance of the current index. Performance of the Fund prior to the\nBenchmark Index Change Date is therefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the Previous\nBenchmark Index and may have been different had the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                                                                    \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                 5.78%    1.62%      2.62%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 5.77%    1.61%      2.60%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     4.44%    1.72%      2.54%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                       \n  Bloomberg Municipal Managed Money 1-25 Years                                      \n  Index/Bloomberg Municipal Managed Money             6.44%    2.23%      3.06%     \n  Index1(reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or                                \n  taxes)                                                                            \n  Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no    5.53%    1.10%      1.81%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                            \n                                                                                    \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the Index for periods beginning on the Benchmark Index Change Date and the\nPrevious Benchmark Index for periods prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date. Portfolio Management\nInvestment Adviser and Sub-Adviser SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d) serves as the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund. Nuveen Asset Management serves as investment sub-adviser to the Fund,\nsubject to supervision by the Adviser and oversight by the Trust's Board of Trustees. To the extent that a\nreference in this Prospectus refers to the Adviser, with respect to the Fund, such reference should also be\nread to refer to Nuveen Asset Management, where the context requires. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Timothy Ryan and Joel Levy. Timothy T.\nRyan, CFA, is a Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Nuveen Asset Management. Mr. Ryan joined an\naffiliate of Nuveen Asset Management in 2010. Joel H. Levy is a Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at\nNuveen Asset Management. Mr. Levy joined an affiliate of Nuveen Asset Management in 2011. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through\nyour broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund intends to pay income that is exempt from regular federal income tax, but which may\nbe subject to federal alternative minimum tax. A portion of the Fund's distributions may be subject to such\ntaxes. Income from municipal securities of states other than the shareholder's state of residence generally\nwill not qualify for tax-free treatment for such shareholder with respect to state and local taxes. Payments\nto Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or\nother financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n65\n\nSPDR \u00ae Nuveen Bloomberg Short Term Municipal Bond ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Short Term Municipal     \n  Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide             \n  investmentresults that, before fees and expenses,  \n  correspond generally to the price and yield        \n  performance of an indexthat tracks the short term  \n  tax exempt municipal bond market and provides      \n  income that is exempt fromfederal income taxes.    \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.20%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.20%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 40 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg Managed Money Municipal Short Term Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, Nuveen Asset Management, LLC\n(\u201cNuveen Asset Management\u201d or the \u201cSub-Adviser\u201d), the\ninvestment sub-adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Sub-\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index and\nin securities that the Sub-Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities that comprise\nthe Index. Additionally, the Fund intends to invest, under\nnormal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets, plus\nthe amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in\ninvestments the income of which is exempt from Federal\nincome tax. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are not included in\nthe Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by SSGA Funds\n\n66\n\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. The Index is\ndesigned to track the publicly traded municipal bonds that\ncover the U.S. dollar denominated short term tax exempt\nbond market, including state and local general obligation\nbonds, revenue bonds, pre-refunded bonds, and insured\nbonds. A general obligation bond is secured by the full\nfaith and credit of its issuer. A revenue bond is payable\nfrom a specific source of revenue. A pre-refunded bond is a\nrevenue bond that the issuer has allocated funds to fully\nretire. An insured bond is protected from issuer default or\nrating downgrade by an insurance company. The Index is a\nrules-based, market-value weighted index. All bonds in the\nIndex must be rated Aa3/AA- or higher by at least two of\nthe following statistical ratings agencies: Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings or Fitch\nRatings Inc. If only two of the three agencies rate the\nsecurity, the lower rating is used to determine index\neligibility. If only one of the agencies rates the\nsecurity, the rating must be at least Aa3/AA-. Each Index\nsecurity must have an outstanding par value of at least $7\nmillion and be issued as part of a transaction of at least\n$75 million. The bonds must be fixed rate and have a\nnominal maturity of one to five years. No issuer may\nconstitute more than 10% of the Index. Securities included\nin the Index may include when-issued securities. Bonds\nsubject to alternative minimum tax, hospital bonds, housing\nbonds, tobacco bonds, and airline bonds, along with\nremarketed issues, taxable municipal bonds, floaters, and\nderivatives are all excluded from the Index. As of July 31,\n2024, there were 3,916 securities in the Index and the\ndollar-weighted average maturity of the securities in the\nIndex was 3 years. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund, the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser.\nThe Index Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Municipal Obligations Risk: Issuers, including\ngovernmental issuers, may be unable to pay their\nobligations as they come due. The values of municipal\nobligations may be adversely affected by local political\nand economic conditions and developments. In addition, the\nvalues of municipal obligations that depend on a specific\nrevenue source to fund their payment obligations may\nfluctuate as a result of actual or anticipated changes in\nthe cash flows generated by the revenue source or changes\nin the priority of the municipal obligation to receive the\ncash flows generated by the revenue source. Municipal\nobligations may be more susceptible to downgrades or\ndefaults during recessions or similar periods of economic\nstress. In addition, changes in U.S. federal tax laws or\nthe activity 67 of an issuer may adversely affect the tax-\nexempt status of municipal obligations. Loss of tax-exempt\nstatus may cause interest received and distributed by the\nFund to shareholders to be taxable and may result in a\nsignificant decline in the values of such municipal\nobligations. Political Risk: A significant restructuring of\nfederal income tax rates or even serious discussion on the\ntopic in Congress could cause municipal bond prices to\nfall. The demand for municipal securities is strongly\ninfluenced by the value of tax-exempt income to investors.\nLower income tax rates could reduce the advantage of owning\nmunicipals. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Income\nRisk: The Fund's income may decline due to falling interest\nrates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the\nFund may call or redeem the securities during periods of\nfalling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying lower interest\nrates. If an obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Sub-Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Sub-Adviser\nmay attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Low Short-Term\nInterest Rates Risk: During market conditions in which\nshort-term interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be very low, and the Fund may have a negative\nyield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis).\nDuring these conditions, it is possible that the Fund will\ngenerate an insufficient amount of income to pay its\nexpenses, and will not be able to pay its scheduled\ndividend. In addition, it is possible that during these\nconditions the Fund may experience difficulties purchasing\nand/or selling securities with respect to 68\n\nscheduled rebalances, and may, as a result, maintain a\nportion of its assets in cash, on which it may earn little,\nif any, income. Such market conditions may adversely affect\nthe Fund's ability to achieve a high degree of correlation\nwith the Index. Tax Exemption Risk: There is no guarantee\nthat the Fund's income will be exempt from federal or state\nincome taxes. Events occurring after the date of issuance\nof a municipal bond or after the Fund's acquisition of a\nmunicipal bond may result in a determination that interest\non that bond is includible in gross income for federal\nincome tax purposes retroactively to its date of issuance.\nSuch a determination may cause a portion of prior\ndistributions by the Fund to its shareholders to be taxable\nto those shareholders in the year of receipt. Federal or\nstate changes in income or alternative minimum tax rates or\nin the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make municipal\nbonds less attractive as investments and cause them to\ndecline in value. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio\nholdings may be valued on the basis of factors other than\nmarket quotations. This may occur more often in times of\nmarket turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple\nmethods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available. The value\nestablished for any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using a different\nmethodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. When-\nIssued Securities Risk: The Fund may purchase securities on\na when-issued or forward commitment basis. The purchase\nprice of such securities is typically fixed at the time of\nthe commitment, with delivery and payment taking place in\nthe future. At the time of delivery of the securities, the\nvalue may be more or less than the purchase or sale price.\nPurchase of securities on a when-issued or forward\ncommitment basis may give rise to investment leverage, and\nmay result in increased volatility of the Fund's net asset\nvalue. Default by, or bankruptcy of, a counterparty to a\nwhen-issued transaction would expose the Fund to possible\nlosses because of an adverse market action, expenses or\ndelays in connection with the purchase or sale of the pools\nspecified in such transaction. Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority, Inc. rules impose mandatory margin\nrequirements for certain types of when-issued or forward\ncommitment transactions, with limited exceptions. Such\ntransactions require mandatory collateralization which may\nincrease the cost of such transactions and impose added\noperational complexity.

Nuveen Asset Management serves as investment sub-\nadviser to the Fund, subject to supervision by the Adviser and oversight by the Trust's Board of Trustees.\nTo the extent that a reference in this Prospectus refers to the Adviser, with respect to the Fund, such\nreference should also be read to refer to Nuveen Asset Management, where the context requires. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Timothy Ryan\nand Joel Levy. Timothy T. Ryan, CFA, is a Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Nuveen Asset\nManagement. Mr. Ryan joined an affiliate of Nuveen Asset Management in 2010. Joel H. Levy is a Managing\nDirector and Portfolio Manager at Nuveen Asset Management. Mr. Levy joined an affiliate of Nuveen Asset\nManagement in 2011. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks\nand other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade\nat market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV\n(premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase\nFund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund intends to pay income that is exempt\nfrom regular federal income tax, but which may be subject to federal alternative minimum tax. A portion of\nthe Fund's distributions may be subject to such taxes. Income from municipal securities of states other than\nthe shareholder's state of residence generally will not qualify for tax-free treatment for such shareholder\nwith respect to state and local taxes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser\nor its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems,\nor other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund\nover another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more\ninformation.\n\n70\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio Aggregate Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Portfolio Aggregate Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)  \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before    \n  feesand expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  price and yield performance of an index that        \n  tracks the U.S.dollar denominated investment grade  \n  bond market.                                        \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.03%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 13 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. TBA Transactions\n(as defined below) are included within the above-noted\ninvestment policy. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in debt securities that are not\nincluded in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and\ncash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\n\n71\n\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives, including credit\ndefault swaps and credit default index swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of the U.S. dollar denominated investment grade\nbond market, which includes investment grade (must be\nBaa3/BBB- or higher using the middle rating of Moody's\nInvestors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch\nRatings Inc.) government bonds, investment grade corporate\nbonds, mortgage pass-through securities, commercial\nmortgage backed securities and other asset backed\nsecurities that are publicly for sale in the United States.\nThe securities in the Index must have at least 1 year\nremaining to maturity and must have $300 million or more of\noutstanding face value. Asset backed securities must have a\nminimum deal size of $500 million and a minimum tranche\nsize of $25 million. For commercial mortgage backed\nsecurities, the original aggregate transaction must have a\nminimum deal size of $500 million, and a minimum tranche\nsize of $25 million; the aggregate outstanding transaction\nsizes must be at least $300 million to remain in the Index.\nIn addition, the securities must be U.S. dollar\ndenominated, fixed rate, non-convertible, and taxable.\nCertain types of securities, such as flower bonds, targeted\ninvestor notes, and state and local government series bonds\nare excluded from the Index. Also excluded from the Index\nare structured notes with embedded swaps or other special\nfeatures, private placements, floating rate securities and\nEurobonds. The Index is market capitalization weighted and\nthe securities in the Index are updated on the last\nbusiness day of each month. As of July 31, 2024, there were\n13,627 securities in the Index. As of July 31, 2024,\napproximately 25.56% of the bonds represented in the Index\nwere U.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities. U.S.\nagency mortgage pass-through securities are securities\nissued by entities such as Government National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cGNMA\u201d) and Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFNMA\u201d) that are backed by pools of mortgages.\nTransactions in mortgage pass-through securities may occur\nthrough standardized contracts for future delivery in which\nthe exact mortgage pools to be delivered are not specified\nuntil a few days prior to settlement, referred to as a \u201cto-\nbe-announced transaction\u201d or \u201cTBA Transaction.\u201d In a TBA\nTransaction, the buyer and seller agree upon general trade\nparameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount and\nprice. The actual pools delivered generally are determined\ntwo days prior to the settlement date; however, it is not\nanticipated that the Fund will receive pools, but instead\nwill participate in rolling TBA Transactions. The Fund\nexpects to enter into such contracts on a regular basis.\nThe Fund, pending settlement of such contracts, will invest\nits assets in high-quality, liquid short term instruments,\nincluding shares of affiliated money market funds. The\nIndex is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or\nthe Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition\nof the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on 72\nthe values of debt securities of longer durations. Returns\non investments in debt securities could trail the returns\non other investment options, including investments in\nequity securities. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nin the secondary market may differ from the Fund's daily\nnet asset value per share and there may be times when the\nmarket price of the shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset value per\nshare (discount). This risk is heightened in times of\nmarket volatility or periods of steep market declines.\nIncome Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to falling\ninterest rates or other factors. Issuers of securities held\nby the Fund may call or redeem the securities during\nperiods of falling interest rates, and the Fund would\nlikely be required to reinvest in securities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an obligation held by the Fund is\nprepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the prepayment in\nother obligations paying income at lower rates. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Money Market Fund\nInvestment Risk: An investment in a money market fund is\nnot a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed\nby the FDIC or any other government agency. Certain money\nmarket funds seek to preserve the value of their shares at\n$1.00 per share, although there can be no assurance that\nthey will do so, and it is possible to lose money by\ninvesting in such a money market fund. A major or\nunexpected change in interest rates or a decline in the\ncredit quality of an issuer or entity providing credit\nsupport, an inactive trading market for money market\ninstruments, or adverse market, economic, industry,\npolitical, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions\ncould cause the share price of such a money market fund to\nfall below $1.00. Other money market funds price and\ntransact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV that will fluctuate along with\nchanges in the market-based value of fund assets. Shares\nsold utilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or less\nthan their original purchase price. Recent changes in the\nregulation of money market funds may affect the operations\nand structures of money market funds. 73 Mortgage-Related\nand Other Asset-Backed Securities Risk: Investments in\nmortgage-related and other asset-backed securities are\nsubject to the risk of significant credit downgrades,\nilliquidity, and defaults to a greater extent than many\nother types of fixed-income investments. The liquidity of\nmortgage-related and asset-backed securities may change\nover time. During periods of falling interest rates,\nmortgage- and asset-backed securities may be called or\nprepaid, which may result in the Fund having to reinvest\nproceeds in other investments at a lower interest rate.\nDuring periods of rising interest rates, the average life\nof mortgage- and asset-backed securities may extend, which\nmay lock in a below-market interest rate, increase the\nsecurity's duration and interest rate sensitivity, and\nreduce the value of the security. Enforcing rights against\nthe underlying assets or collateral may be difficult, and\nthe underlying assets or collateral may be insufficient if\nthe issuer defaults. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party\ncontract that generally obligates the parties to exchange\npayments based on a specified reference security, basket of\nsecurities, security index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment in securities\nbecause swaps may be leveraged and are subject to\ncounterparty risk (e.g., the risk of a counterparty's\ndefaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk\nand pricing risk (i.e., swaps may be difficult to value).\nIt may not be possible for the Fund to liquidate a swap\nposition at an advantageous time or price, which may result\nin significant losses. U.S. Government Securities Risk:\nCertain U.S. government securities are supported by the\nfull faith and credit of the United States; others are\nsupported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the\nU.S. Treasury; others are supported by the discretionary\nauthority of the U.S. government to purchase the agency's\nobligations; and still others are supported only by the\ncredit of the issuing agency, instrumentality, or\nenterprise. Although U.S. government-sponsored enterprises\nsuch as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\n(\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) and the Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) may be chartered or sponsored by\nCongress, they are not funded by Congressional\nappropriations, and their securities are not issued by the\nU.S. Treasury, are not supported by the full faith and\ncredit of the U.S. government, and involve increased credit\nrisks. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be\nvalued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. When-Issued, TBA and Delayed Delivery\nSecurities Risk: The Fund may purchase securities on a\nwhen-issued, to-be-announced (\u201cTBA\u201d) or delayed delivery\nbasis and may purchase securities on a forward commitment\nbasis. The purchase price of the securities is typically\nfixed at the time of the commitment, but delivery and\npayment can take place a month or more after the date of\nthe commitment. At the time of delivery of the securities,\nthe value may be more or less than the purchase or sale\nprice. Purchase of securities on a when-issued, TBA,\ndelayed delivery, or forward commitment basis may give rise\nto investment leverage, and may result in increased\nvolatility of the Fund's net asset value. Default by, or\nbankruptcy of, a counterparty to a when-issued, TBA or\ndelayed delivery transaction would expose the Fund to\npossible losses because of an adverse market action,\nexpenses or delays in connection with the purchase or sale\nof the pools specified in such transaction. The Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority, Inc. imposes mandatory\nmargin requirements for certain types of when-issued, TBA,\ndelayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, with\nlimited exceptions. Such transactions require mandatory\ncollateralization which may increase the cost of such\ntransactions and impose added operational complexity. 74\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                                                                    \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                 5.59%    1.04%      1.73%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 4.13%    -0.06%     0.61%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     3.28%    0.35%      0.84%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                       \n  Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no    5.53%    1.10%      1.81%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                            \n  Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no  5.72%    -0.32%     0.38%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                            \n                                                                                    \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Marc\nDiCosimo, Michael Przygoda and Read Burns. Marc DiCosimo, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2013. Michael\nPrzygoda, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. He joined the Adviser in 2006. Read Burns is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager\nin the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2012. Purchase and Sale Information The\nFund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other\nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions\nare conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national\nsecurities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\n\n75\n\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information. 76\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio Corporate Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Portfolio Corporate Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)  \n  seeks to provide investment results that, before    \n  feesand expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  price and yield performance of an index that        \n  tracks the U.S.corporate bond market.               \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.03%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 21 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or\n\n77\n\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives, including credit\ndefault swaps and credit default index swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of the investment grade corporate bond market.\nThe Index includes publicly issued, investment grade,\nfixed-rate, taxable, U.S. dollar-denominated corporate\nbonds issued by U.S. and non-U.S. industrial, utility, and\nfinancial institutions. Bonds included in the Index must\nhave $300 million or more of par amount outstanding and a\nremaining maturity of at least 1 year. The Index considers\ninvestment grade securities to be rated Baa3/BBB- or\nhigher, using the middle rating of Moody's Investors\nService, Inc., Fitch Ratings Inc., or S&P Global Ratings.\nIf only two of the three agencies rate the security, then\nthe more conservative (lower) rating will be used to\ndetermine Index eligibility. If only one of the agencies\nrates the security, then that rating will be used. SEC-\nregistered securities, bonds exempt from registration at\nthe time of issuance and SEC Rule 144A securities with\nregistration rights are eligible for inclusion. The Index\nis rebalanced monthly on the last business day of the\nmonth. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the\nFund comprised companies in the financial and industrial\nsectors, although this may change from time to time. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, there were 8,040 securities in the Index.\nThe Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation, which may limit both the\namounts and types of loans and other financial commitments\nthey can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge,\nthe scope of their activities, the prices they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds and can fluctuate 78 significantly when\ninterest rates change or due to increased competition. In\naddition, deterioration of the credit markets generally may\ncause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide range of\nfinancial institutions and markets. Certain events in the\nfinancial sector may cause an unusually high degree of\nvolatility in the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services companies to\nincur large losses. Securities of financial services\ncompanies may experience a dramatic decline in value when\nsuch companies experience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to raise capital\n(such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or\ncease operations. Credit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can negatively impact the\nsector. Insurance companies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or political\ndevelopments could adversely affect financial institutions\nengaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to the value of\nreal estate. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,\nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on resale may\nlimit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid investments\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in\nmarket value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, 79 the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S. securities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent investments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have a more\nsignificant impact on the Fund. Certain countries may\ninstitute negative interest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's susceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity.\nRestricted Securities Risk: The Fund may hold securities\nthat have not been registered for sale to the public under\nthe U.S. federal securities laws. There can be no assurance\nthat a trading market will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Limitations on the resale\nof these securities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of\nthem promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund may have to\nbear the expense of registering the securities for resale\nand the risk of substantial delays in effecting the\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult\nto value because market quotations may not be readily\navailable, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract that\ngenerally obligates the parties to exchange payments based\non a specified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve\ngreater risks than direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk\n(e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be\npossible for the Fund to liquidate a swap position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be\nvalued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. 80\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the\nFund will perform in the future.

Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective July 31, 2018 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Bloomberg Issuer Scored Corporate Index (the \u201cPrevious\nBenchmark Index\u201d) to the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the performance of the current index.

Michael Brunell, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Frank Miethe,\nCFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He\njoined the Adviser in 2010. Christopher DiStefano is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager\nin the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2010.\n\n81\n\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as\na 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement\nmay be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund\nShares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its\naffiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems,\nor other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund\nover another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more\ninformation. 82\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio High Yield Bond ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Portfolio High Yield Bond ETF (the        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  before feesand expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the price and yield performance of an index that   \n  tracks the broadU.S. corporate high yield market.  \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.05%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.05%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $5         $16     $28      $64  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 32 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the ICE\nBofA US High Yield Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index and\nin securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities that comprise\nthe Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are not included in\nthe Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or\n\n83\n\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives, including credit\ndefault swaps and credit default index swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of U.S. dollar denominated below investment\ngrade (commonly referred to as \u201cjunk\u201d) corporate debt\npublicly issued in the U.S. domestic market. The Index\nincludes securities rated below investment grade (based on\nan average of Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Fitch\nRatings Inc., and S&P Global Ratings) with at least 18\nmonths remaining to final maturity at the time of issuance\nand at least one year remaining term to final maturity as\nof the Index's rebalancing date. In addition, individual\nsecurities of qualifying issuers must have a fixed coupon\nschedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million.\nQualifying corporate issuers must have risk exposure to an\nFX-G10 or Western European country, or a territory of the\nUnited States or a Western European country. As of July 31,\n2024, the FX-G10 includes all Eurozone members, the United\nStates, Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New\nZealand, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden. Securities\nincluded in the Index may include securities that are\nsubject to restrictions on resale under the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws (\u201crestricted securities\u201d). The Index is\nmarket capitalization weighted, and is rebalanced on the\nlast calendar day of the month based on information\navailable up to and including the third business day before\nthe last business day of the month. As of August 31, 2024,\na significant portion of the Fund comprised companies in\nthe consumer cyclical sector, although this may change from\ntime to time. As of July 31, 2024, there were approximately\n1,858 securities in the Index. The Index is sponsored by\nICE Data Indices, LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Below Investment-Grade Securities Risk: Lower-\nquality debt securities (\u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) are\nconsidered predominantly speculative, and can involve a\nsubstantially greater risk of default than higher quality\ndebt securities. Issuers of lower-quality debt securities\nmay have substantially greater risk of insolvency or\nbankruptcy than issuers of higher-quality debt securities.\nThey can be illiquid, and their values can have significant\nvolatility and may decline significantly over short periods\nof time. Lower-quality debt securities tend to be more\nsensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or the market\nor economy in general. 84 Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be\ntimes when the market price of the shares is more than the\nnet asset value per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened\nin times of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Consumer Cyclical Sector Risk: Companies in the\nconsumer cyclical sector are largely impacted by the\nperformance of the overall global economy, changes in\ninterest rates, fluctuations in supply and demand, and\nchanges in consumer preferences. Success depends heavily on\ndisposable household income and consumer spending. As a\nresult, consumer cyclical companies may be adversely\naffected and lose value quickly in periods of economic\ndownturns. Geographic Focus Risk: The performance of a fund\nthat invests significantly in one or more countries or\ngeographic regions will be closely tied to market,\ncurrency, economic, political, environmental, or regulatory\nconditions and developments in the countries or regions in\nwhich the fund invests, and may be more volatile than the\nperformance of a fund that does not invest significantly in\nsuch countries or regions. Europe: Developed and emerging\nmarket countries in Europe will be significantly affected\nby the fiscal and monetary controls of the Economic and\nMonetary Union of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). Changes in\nregulations on trade, decreasing imports or exports,\nchanges in the exchange rate of the euro and recessions\namong European countries may have a significant adverse\neffect on the economies of other European countries. In\naddition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or\nwithdraw from the EU. For example, on January 31, 2020, the\nUnited Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU (commonly\nreferred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and, after a transition period,\nleft the EU single market and customs union under the terms\nof a new trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The\nagreement governs the new relationship between the United\nKingdom and EU with respect to trading goods and services,\nbut critical aspects of the relationship remain unresolved\nand subject to further negotiation and agreement. The full\nscope and nature of the consequences of the exit are not at\nthis time known and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown whether the\nUnited Kingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of other\ncountries also departing the EU. Any exits from the EU, or\nthe possibility of such exits, may have a significant\nimpact on the United Kingdom, Europe, and global economies,\nwhich may result in increased volatility and illiquidity,\nnew legal and regulatory uncertainties and potentially\nlower economic growth for such economies that could\npotentially have an adverse effect on the value of the\nFund's investments. In addition, a number of countries in\nEurope have suffered terrorist attacks and additional\nattacks may occur in the future. Such attacks may cause\nuncertainty in financial markets and may adversely affect\nthe performance of the issuers to which the Fund has\nexposure. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a 85\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S. securities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent investments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have a more\nsignificant impact on the Fund. Certain countries may\ninstitute negative interest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's susceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity.\nRestricted Securities Risk: The Fund may hold securities\nthat have not been registered for sale to the public under\nthe U.S. federal securities laws. There can be no assurance\nthat a trading market will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Limitations on the resale\nof these securities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of\nthem promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund may have to\nbear the expense of registering the securities for resale\nand the risk of substantial delays in effecting the\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult\nto value because market quotations may not be readily\navailable, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract that\ngenerally obligates the parties to exchange payments based\non a specified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve\ngreater risks than direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk\n(e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be\npossible for the Fund to liquidate a swap position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose 86\n\nout a portfolio position for the value established for it\nat any time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a\nloss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at\na discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that\ntime. Fund Performance The following bar chart and table\nprovide an indication of the risks of investing in the Fund\nby showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to\nyear and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns\nfor certain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the\nFund will perform in the future.

Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective April 1, 2019 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the ICE BofAML US Diversified Crossover Corporate Index (the\n\u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the ICE BofA US High Yield Index (formerly known as ICE BofAML US High Yield\nIndex), consistent with a change in the Fund's principal investment strategy to track the performance of the\ncurrent index. Performance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date is therefore based on the\nFund's investment strategy to track the Previous Benchmark Index and may have been different had the Fund\ntracked the current index.\n                                                                                  \n                                                    OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                               13.54%   5.25%      4.39%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions               10.13%   2.66%      2.18%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of   7.89%    2.91%      2.38%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                     \n  ICE BofA US High Yield Index/ICE BofAML US                                      \n  Diversified Crossover Corporate Index1(reflects   13.46%   4.99%      4.42%     \n  nodeduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                        \n  Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no  5.53%    1.10%      1.81%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                          \n                                                                                  \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the Index for periods beginning on the Benchmark Index Change Date and the\nPrevious Benchmark Index for periods prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers)\nonly in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in\nexchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market\nprices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a\nbuyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's\ndistributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing\nthrough a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 88\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate     \n  Bond ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide             \n  investmentresults that, before fees and expenses,  \n  correspond generally to the price and yield        \n  performance of an indexthat tracks the             \n  intermediate term (1-10 years) sector of the       \n  United States corporate bond market.               \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.04%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.04%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $4         $13     $23      $51  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 30 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg U.S. Intermediate Corporate Bond Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the\nIndex in approximately the same proportions as the Index,\nas determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or\n\n89\n\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives, including credit\ndefault swaps and credit default index swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of U.S. corporate bonds that have a maturity of\ngreater than or equal to 1 year and less than 10 years. The\nIndex is a component of the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Index\nand includes investment grade, fixed-rate, taxable, U.S.\ndollar denominated debt with $300 million or more of par\namount outstanding, issued by U.S. and non-U.S. industrial,\nutility, and financial institutions. Subordinated issues,\nsecurities with normal call and put provisions and sinking\nfunds, medium-term notes (if they are publicly\nunderwritten), 144A securities with registration rights,\nand global issues that are SEC-registered are included.\nStructured notes with embedded swaps or other special\nfeatures, as well as private placements, floating- rate\nsecurities, and Eurobonds are excluded from the Index. The\nIndex is rebalanced monthly, on the last business day of\nthe month. As of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of\nthe Fund comprised companies in the financial and\nindustrial sectors, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, there were 5,024 securities in\nthe Index and the dollar-weighted average maturity of the\nsecurities in the Index was 4.85 years. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation, which may limit both the\namounts and types of loans and other financial commitments\nthey can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge,\nthe scope of their activities, the prices they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds and can fluctuate 90 significantly when\ninterest rates change or due to increased competition. In\naddition, deterioration of the credit markets generally may\ncause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide range of\nfinancial institutions and markets. Certain events in the\nfinancial sector may cause an unusually high degree of\nvolatility in the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services companies to\nincur large losses. Securities of financial services\ncompanies may experience a dramatic decline in value when\nsuch companies experience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to raise capital\n(such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or\ncease operations. Credit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can negatively impact the\nsector. Insurance companies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or political\ndevelopments could adversely affect financial institutions\nengaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to the value of\nreal estate. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,\nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on resale may\nlimit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid investments\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in\nmarket value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, 91 the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S. securities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent investments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have a more\nsignificant impact on the Fund. Certain countries may\ninstitute negative interest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's susceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity.\nRestricted Securities Risk: The Fund may hold securities\nthat have not been registered for sale to the public under\nthe U.S. federal securities laws. There can be no assurance\nthat a trading market will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Limitations on the resale\nof these securities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of\nthem promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund may have to\nbear the expense of registering the securities for resale\nand the risk of substantial delays in effecting the\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult\nto value because market quotations may not be readily\navailable, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Swaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract that\ngenerally obligates the parties to exchange payments based\non a specified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve\ngreater risks than direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk\n(e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be\npossible for the Fund to liquidate a swap position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be\nvalued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. 92\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through\nyour broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\n\n93\n\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information. 94\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio Intermediate Term Treasury ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Treasury ETF   \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results    \n  that,before fees and expenses, correspond           \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index that tracksthe intermediate-term sector of    \n  the United States Treasury market.                  \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.03%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 19 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg 3-10 Year U.S. Treasury Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. The Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of intermediate term\n(3-10 years) public obligations of the U.S. Treasury. The\nIndex includes all publicly issued U.S. Treasury securities\nthat have a remaining maturity of greater than\n\n95\n\nor equal to 3 years and less than 10 years, are rated\ninvestment grade and have $300 million or more of\noutstanding face value. In addition, the securities must be\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, fixed rate and non-\nconvertible. Securities excluded from the Index include\nstate and local government series bonds, inflation\nprotected public obligations of the U.S. Treasury, commonly\nknown as \u201cTIPS,\u201d floating rate bonds and coupon issues that\nhave been stripped from bonds included in the Index. The\nIndex is market capitalization weighted and the securities\nin the Index are updated on the last business day of each\nmonth. As of July 31, 2024, there were 108 securities in\nthe Index and the dollar-weighted average maturity of the\nsecurities in the Index was 5.58 years. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other fixed income securities\nin their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and\nother characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to\nthe financial condition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be\ntimes when the market price of the shares is more than the\nnet asset value per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened\nin times of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than 96 that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Securities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or any investments made with cash collateral.\nThese events could also trigger adverse tax consequences\nfor the Fund. To the extent the collateral provided or\ninvestments made with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss than the\nsecurities included in the Index. Valuation Risk: Certain\nportfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors\nother than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio\nholding when market quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio holding at a point\nin time might differ from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. 97\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective April 30, 2018 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Bloomberg Intermediate U.S. Treasury Index (the\n\u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the Bloomberg 3-10 Year U.S. Treasury Index, consistent with a change in the\nFund's principal investment strategy to track the performance of the current index. Performance of the Fund\nprior to the Benchmark Index Change Date is therefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index and may have been different had the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                                                                   \n                                                     OneYear  FiveYears  TenYears  \n  Return Before Taxes                                4.26%    0.77%      1.13%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                2.98%    0.13%      0.52%     \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of    2.50%    0.32%      0.60%     \n  Fund Shares                                                                      \n  Bloomberg 3-10 Year U.S. Treasury Index/Bloomberg                                \n  Intermediate U.S. Treasury Index1(reflects         4.27%    0.84%      1.22%     \n  nodeduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                         \n  Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (reflects no   5.53%    1.10%      1.81%     \n  deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)                                           \n                                                                                   \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the Index for periods beginning on the Benchmark Index Change Date and the\nPrevious Benchmark Index for periods prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date.

Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.04%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.04%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $4         $13     $23      $51  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 15 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg U.S. Long Term Corporate Bond Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the\nIndex in approximately the same proportions as the Index,\nas determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to the extent\nthat the Index concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries.\n\n100\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of U.S.\ncorporate bonds that have a maturity of greater than or\nequal to 10 years. The Index is a component of the\nBloomberg U.S. Corporate Index and includes investment\ngrade, fixed-rate, taxable, U.S. dollar-denominated debt\nwith $300 million or more of par amount outstanding, issued\nby U.S. and non-U.S. industrial, utility, and financial\ninstitutions. Subordinated issues, securities with normal\ncall and put provisions and sinking funds, medium-term\nnotes (if they are publicly underwritten), 144A securities\nwith registration rights, and global issues that are SEC-\nregistered are included. Structured notes with embedded\nswaps or other special features, as well as private\nplacements, floating-rate securities, and Eurobonds are\nexcluded from the Index. The Index is rebalanced monthly,\non the last business day of the month. As of August 31,\n2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies\nin the industrial and financial sectors, although this may\nchange from time to time. As of July 31, 2024, there were\n3,016 securities in the Index and the dollar-weighted\naverage maturity of the securities in the Index was 22.64\nyears. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services\nLimited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation, which may limit both the\namounts and types of loans and other financial commitments\nthey can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge,\nthe scope of their activities, the prices they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability\nis largely dependent on the availability and cost of\ncapital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an\nadverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money markets\ngenerally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial\ninstitutions and markets. Certain events in the financial\nsector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in\nthe financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause\ncertain financial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial 101 services companies may\nexperience a dramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the valuations of their\nassets, take action to raise capital (such as the issuance\nof debt or equity securities), or cease operations. Credit\nlosses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers\nand financial losses associated with investment activities\ncan negatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may\nbe subject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Income Risk: The\nFund's income may decline due to falling interest rates or\nother factors. Issuers of securities held by the Fund may\ncall or redeem the securities during periods of falling\ninterest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to\nreinvest in securities paying lower interest rates. If an\nobligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying\nincome at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,\nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on resale may\nlimit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid investments\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in\nmarket value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S. securities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards 102\n\ncomparable to those in the United States. Further, such\nentities and/or their securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls; expropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater market volatility; differing\nsecurities market structures; higher transaction costs; and\nvarious administrative difficulties, such as delays in\nclearing and settling portfolio transactions or in\nreceiving payment of dividends. To the extent underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges that\nare closed when the exchange on which the Fund's shares\ntrade is open, there may be deviations between the current\nprice of an underlying security and the last quoted price\nfor the underlying security on the closed foreign market.\nThese deviations could result in the Fund experiencing\npremiums or discounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Securities traded on foreign\nmarkets may be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities\ntraded domestically. Foreign governments may impose\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries will have a\nmore significant impact on the Fund. Certain countries may\ninstitute negative interest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's susceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity.\nRestricted Securities Risk: The Fund may hold securities\nthat have not been registered for sale to the public under\nthe U.S. federal securities laws. There can be no assurance\nthat a trading market will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Limitations on the resale\nof these securities may have an adverse effect on their\nmarketability, and may prevent the Fund from disposing of\nthem promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund may have to\nbear the expense of registering the securities for resale\nand the risk of substantial delays in effecting the\nregistration. Also, restricted securities may be difficult\nto value because market quotations may not be readily\navailable, and the securities may have significant\nvolatility. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may\nbe valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. Fund Performance The following bar chart and\ntable provide an indication of the risks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from\nyear to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual\nreturns for certain time periods compare with the average\nannual returns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are David\nMarchetti, Frank Miethe and Christopher DiStefano. David Marchetti, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2013. Frank\nMiethe, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. He joined the Adviser in 2010. Christopher DiStefano is a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2010. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through\nyour broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\n\n104\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio Long Term Treasury ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Portfolio Long Term Treasury ETF (the     \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the price and yield performance of an index that   \n  tracks the longterm (10+ years) sector of the      \n  United States Treasury market.                     \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.03%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 3 % of the average value\nof its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\nIn seeking to track the performance of the Bloomberg Long\nU.S. Treasury Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index and\nin securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the\neconomic characteristics of the securities that comprise\nthe Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the\nFund may invest in debt securities that are not included in\nthe Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. The Index is designed to measure the performance\nof public obligations of the U.S. Treasury that have a\nremaining maturity of 10 years or more. The Index includes\nall publicly issued, U.S. Treasury securities that have a\nremaining\n\n105\n\nmaturity of 10 years or more, are rated investment grade,\nand have $300 million or more of outstanding face value. In\naddition, the securities must be denominated in U.S.\ndollars and must be fixed rate and non-convertible.\nExcluded from the Index are certain special issues, such as\nflower bonds, targeted investor notes, state and local\ngovernment series bonds, inflation protected public\nobligations of the U.S. Treasury, commonly known as \u201cTIPS,\u201d\nand coupon issues that have been stripped from bonds\nincluded in the Index. The Index is market capitalization\nweighted and the securities in the Index are updated on the\nlast business day of each month. As of July 31, 2024, there\nwere 84 securities in the Index and the dollar-weighted\naverage maturity of the securities in the Index was 22.50\nyears. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services\nLimited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other fixed income securities\nin their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and\nother characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to\nthe financial condition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be\ntimes when the market price of the shares is more than the\nnet asset value per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened\nin times of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than 106 that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Securities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or any investments made with cash collateral.\nThese events could also trigger adverse tax consequences\nfor the Fund. To the extent the collateral provided or\ninvestments made with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss than the\nsecurities included in the Index. Valuation Risk: Certain\nportfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors\nother than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio\nholding when market quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio holding at a point\nin time might differ from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. 107\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Joanna\nMadden, Cynthia Moy and James Kramer. Joanna Madden is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio\nManager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2003. Cynthia Moy is a Principal\nof the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n2007. James Kramer is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income\nBeta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers)\nonly in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in\nexchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market\nprices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may\ntrade at a price\n\n108\n\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information. 109\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio Mortgage Backed Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Portfolio Mortgage Backed Bond ETF (the    \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results         \n  that,before fees and expenses, correspond           \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index that tracksthe U.S. agency mortgage           \n  pass-through sector of the U.S. investment grade    \n  bond market.                                        \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                  \n  Management fees                        0.04%    \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None     \n  Other expenses                         0.00%    \n  Acquired fund fees and expenses1       0.01%    \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.05%    \n  Less contractual fee waiver2           (0.01)%  \n  Net annual Fund operating expenses     0.04%    \n                                                  \n1 \u201cAcquired fund fees and expenses\u201d are not included in the Fund's financial statements, which provide a\nclearer picture of the Fund's actual operating costs. 2 SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (the \u201cAdviser\u201d) has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount equal\nto any acquired fund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) until October 31, 2025 . This waiver and/or reimbursement does not provide for the recoupment by the\nAdviser of any amounts waived or reimbursed. The Adviser may continue the waiver and/or reimbursement from\nyear to year, but there is no guarantee that the Adviser will do so and the waiver and/or reimbursement may\nbe cancelled or modified at any time after October 31, 2025. This waiver and/or reimbursement may not be\nterminated prior to October 31, 2025 except with the approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees. Example: This\nExample is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in\nother funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated, and\nthen sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. The Example\nreflects the Fund's contractual fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement only in the periods for which the\ncontractual fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement is expected to continue. Although your actual costs may\nbe higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $4         $15     $27      $63  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 10 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg U.S. MBS Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management,\n\n110\n\nInc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a\nsubset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund's\nassets in substantially all of the securities represented\nin the Index in approximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in the best\ninterest of the Fund in pursuing its objective. Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in\nthe securities comprising the Index and in securities that\nthe Adviser determines have economic characteristics that\nare substantially identical to the economic characteristics\nof the securities that comprise the Index. TBA Transactions\n(as defined below) are included within the above-noted\ninvestment policy. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in debt securities that are not\nincluded in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and\ncash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of the U.S. agency mortgage pass-through\nsegment of the U.S. investment grade bond market. The term\n\u201cU.S. agency mortgage pass-through security\u201d refers to a\ncategory of pass-through securities backed by pools of\nmortgages and issued by one of the following U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises: Government National\nMortgage Association (\u201cGNMA\u201d); Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFNMA\u201d) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage\nCorporation (\u201cFHLMC\u201d). The Index is formed by grouping the\nuniverse of individual fixed rate mortgage backed\nsecurities pools into generic aggregates according to the\nfollowing parameters: (i) agency; (ii) program; (iii) pass-\nthrough coupon; and (iv) origination year. Index maturity\nand liquidity criteria are then applied to these aggregates\nto determine which qualify for inclusion in the Index. To\nbe included in the Index, securities must be fixed rate,\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and be part of a cohort that\nhas $1 billion or more of outstanding face value and have a\nweighted average maturity of at least one year. Excluded\nfrom the Index are buydowns, graduated equity mortgages,\nproject loans, manufactured homes (dropped in January\n1992), graduated payment mortgages (dropped in January\n1995), non-agency (whole loan) securities, jumbo\nsecurities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and hybrid\nadjustable-rate mortgages. The Index is market\ncapitalization weighted and the securities in the Index are\nupdated on the last calendar day of each month. As of July\n31, 2024, there were 1,007 securities in the Index.\nTransactions in mortgage pass-through securities may occur\nthrough standardized contracts for future delivery in which\nthe exact mortgage pools to be delivered are not specified\nuntil a few days prior to settlement, referred to as a \u201cto-\nbe announced transaction\u201d or \u201cTBA Transaction.\u201d In a TBA\nTransaction, the buyer and seller agree upon general trade\nparameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount and\nprice. The actual pools delivered generally are determined\ntwo days prior to the settlement date. The Fund expects to\nenter into such contracts on a regular basis, and pending\nsettlement of such contracts, the Fund will invest its\nassets in liquid, short-term instruments, including shares\nof money market funds advised by the Adviser or its\naffiliates. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index\nServices Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider\ndetermines the composition of the Index, relative\nweightings of the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the Index.\nPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed 111 income securities,\nand increased volatility of the fixed income markets.\nDuring periods when interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative\nyield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To\nthe extent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed\nSecurities Risk: Investments in mortgage-related and other\nasset-backed securities are subject to the risk of\nsignificant credit downgrades, illiquidity, and defaults to\na greater extent than many other types of fixed-income\ninvestments. The liquidity of mortgage-related and asset-\nbacked securities may change over time. During periods of\nfalling interest rates, mortgage- and asset-backed\nsecurities may be called or prepaid, which may result in\nthe Fund having to reinvest proceeds in other investments\nat a lower interest rate. During periods of rising interest\nrates, the average life of mortgage- and asset-backed\nsecurities may extend, which may lock in a below-market\ninterest rate, increase the security's duration and\ninterest rate sensitivity, and reduce the value of the\nsecurity. Enforcing rights against the underlying assets or\ncollateral may be difficult, and the underlying assets or\ncollateral may be insufficient if the issuer defaults.\nFluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Cash\nTransaction Risk: The Fund may sell portfolio securities to\nmeet some or all of a redemption request with cash. In such\ncases, the Fund may incur taxable gains or losses that it\nmight not have incurred had it made redemptions entirely\nin-kind. As a result, the Fund may pay out higher annual\ncapital gain distributions than if the in-kind redemption\nprocess was used. Income Risk: The Fund's income may\ndecline due to falling interest rates or other factors.\nIssuers of securities held by the Fund may call or redeem\nthe securities during periods of falling interest rates,\nand the Fund would likely be required to reinvest in\nsecurities paying lower interest rates. If an obligation\nheld by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest\nthe prepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. 112\n\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market\nconditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or\nprice or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid investments and may\nbe subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the\nliquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead\nto differences between the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the\nFund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition,\nthe Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid\ninvestments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling\nsuch investments, may be unable to achieve its desired\nlevel of exposure to a certain market or sector. U.S.\nGovernment Securities Risk: Certain U.S. government\nsecurities are supported by the full faith and credit of\nthe United States; others are supported by the right of the\nissuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury; others are\nsupported by the discretionary authority of the U.S.\ngovernment to purchase the agency's obligations; and still\nothers are supported only by the credit of the issuing\nagency, instrumentality, or enterprise. Although U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises such as the Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) and the Federal\nNational Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) may be\nchartered or sponsored by Congress, they are not funded by\nCongressional appropriations, and their securities are not\nissued by the U.S. Treasury, are not supported by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. government, and involve\nincreased credit risks. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio\nholdings may be valued on the basis of factors other than\nmarket quotations. This may occur more often in times of\nmarket turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple\nmethods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are not readily available. The value\nestablished for any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using a different\nmethodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. When-\nIssued, TBA and Delayed Delivery Securities Risk: The Fund\nmay purchase securities on a when-issued, to-be-announced\n(\u201cTBA\u201d) or delayed delivery basis and may purchase\nsecurities on a forward commitment basis. The purchase\nprice of the securities is typically fixed at the time of\nthe commitment, but delivery and payment can take place a\nmonth or more after the date of the commitment. At the time\nof delivery of the securities, the value may be more or\nless than the purchase or sale price. Purchase of\nsecurities on a when-issued, TBA, delayed delivery, or\nforward commitment basis may give rise to investment\nleverage, and may result in increased volatility of the\nFund's net asset value. Default by, or bankruptcy of, a\ncounterparty to a when-issued, TBA or delayed delivery\ntransaction would expose the Fund to possible losses\nbecause of an adverse market action, expenses or delays in\nconnection with the purchase or sale of the pools specified\nin such transaction. The Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority, Inc. imposes mandatory margin requirements for\ncertain types of when-issued, TBA, delayed delivery or\nforward commitment transactions, with limited exceptions.\nSuch transactions require mandatory collateralization which\nmay increase the cost of such transactions and impose added\noperational complexity. Fund Performance The following bar\nchart and table provide an indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's\nperformance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's\naverage annual returns for certain time periods compare\nwith the average annual returns of the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based securities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Marc\nDiCosimo, Michael Przygoda and Read Burns. Marc DiCosimo, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2013. Michael\nPrzygoda, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. He joined the Adviser in 2006. Read Burns is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager\nin the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2012. Purchase and Sale Information The\nFund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other\nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions\nare conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash. Creation Unit transactions may be conducted in exchange for cash only, which may cause the Fund to\nrecognize capital gains and to pay out higher annual capital gain distributions to shareholders than if such\ntransactions had been conducted in-kind. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading\nsystems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than\nat net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to\nthe difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information\nregarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income\nand/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable\nto you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a\nbroker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to\n\n114\n\nthe sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the\nbroker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask\nyour salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information. 115\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio Short Term Corporate Bond ETF\n                                                      \n  Investment Objective                                \n  The SPDR Portfolio Short Term Corporate Bond ETF    \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results    \n  that,before fees and expenses, correspond           \n  generally to the price and yield performance of an  \n  index that tracksthe short-term U.S. corporate      \n  bond market.                                        \n                                                      \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.04%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.04%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $4         $13     $23      $51  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 51 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg U.S. 1-3 Year Corporate Bond Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the\nFund is not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or\n\n116\n\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. The Fund may use derivatives, including credit\ndefault swaps and credit default index swaps, to obtain\ninvestment exposure that the Adviser expects to correlate\nclosely with the Index, or a portion of the Index, and in\nmanaging cash flows. The Index is designed to measure the\nperformance of the short term U.S. corporate bond market.\nThe Index includes publicly issued U.S. dollar denominated\ncorporate issues that have a remaining maturity of greater\nthan or equal to 1 year and less than 3 years, are rated\ninvestment grade (must be Baa3/BBB- or higher using the\nmiddle rating of Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Fitch\nRatings Inc., or S&P Global Ratings), and have $300 million\nor more of outstanding face value. In addition, the\nsecurities must be denominated in U.S. dollars, fixed rate\nand non-convertible. The Index includes only corporate\ncategories. The corporate categories are Industrial,\nUtility, and Financial Institutions, which include both\nU.S. and non-U.S. corporations. The following instruments\nare excluded from the Index: structured notes with embedded\nswaps or other special features; private placements;\nfloating rate securities; and Eurobonds. The Index is\nmarket capitalization weighted and the securities in the\nIndex are updated on the last business day of each month.\nAs of August 31, 2024, a significant portion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in the financial and industrial\nsectors, although this may change from time to time. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, there were 1,502 securities in the Index and\nthe dollar-weighted average maturity of the securities in\nthe Index was 2.03 years. The Index is sponsored by\nBloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and\npublishes information regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are certain risks of investing in the\nFund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose\nmoney by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund\nis not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations\nand the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of\ninvestments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or\nrecession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in\nthe actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk\nthat geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets\nand adversely affect global economies and markets. Local,\nregional or global events such as war, military conflicts,\nacts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health issues, or other\nevents could have a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the\nvalue of those securities may fall sharply. A rising\ninterest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on\nthe liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and\nincreased volatility of the fixed income markets. During\nperiods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's\nyield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the\nextent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than\noriginally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation, which may limit both the\namounts and types of loans and other financial commitments\nthey can make, the interest rates and fees they can charge,\nthe scope of their activities, the prices they can charge\nand the amount of capital they 117 must maintain.\nProfitability is largely dependent on the availability and\ncost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when\ninterest rates change or due to increased competition. In\naddition, deterioration of the credit markets generally may\ncause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide range of\nfinancial institutions and markets. Certain events in the\nfinancial sector may cause an unusually high degree of\nvolatility in the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services companies to\nincur large losses. Securities of financial services\ncompanies may experience a dramatic decline in value when\nsuch companies experience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to raise capital\n(such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or\ncease operations. Credit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can negatively impact the\nsector. Insurance companies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or political\ndevelopments could adversely affect financial institutions\nengaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to the value of\nreal estate. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,\nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on resale may\nlimit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid investments\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in\nmarket value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's 118 holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet\nredemptions on a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due\nto limitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk: Non-U.S. securities are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic\ninvestments. There may be less information publicly\navailable about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity,\nand many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, legal and financial report standards comparable\nto those in the United States. Further, such entities\nand/or their securities may be subject to risks associated\nwith currency controls; expropriation; changes in tax\npolicy; greater market volatility; differing securities\nmarket structures; higher transaction costs; and various\nadministrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of\ndividends. To the extent underlying securities held by the\nFund trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of an\nunderlying security and the last quoted price for the\nunderlying security on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums\nor discounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in\ndomestic securities. Securities traded on foreign markets\nmay be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded\ndomestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions\non the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, to\nthe extent investments are made in a limited number of\ncountries, events in those countries will have a more\nsignificant impact on the Fund. Certain countries may\ninstitute negative interest rates on certain fixed-income\nsecurities, and similar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest rates may\nmagnify the Fund's susceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity.\nSwaps Risk: A swap is a two-party contract that generally\nobligates the parties to exchange payments based on a\nspecified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve\ngreater risks than direct investment in securities because\nswaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk\n(e.g., the risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk\n(i.e., swaps may be difficult to value). It may not be\npossible for the Fund to liquidate a swap position at an\nadvantageous time or price, which may result in significant\nlosses. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be\nvalued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. 119\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

David Marchetti, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2013. Frank\nMiethe, CFA, is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions\nGroup. He joined the Adviser in 2010. Christopher DiStefano is a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in 2010. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through\nyour broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset\nvalue (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\n\n120\n\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information. 121\n\nSPDR \u00ae Portfolio Short Term Treasury ETF\n                                                     \n  Investment Objective                               \n  The SPDR Portfolio Short Term Treasury ETF (the    \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment results that,  \n  beforefees and expenses, correspond generally to   \n  the price and yield performance of an index that   \n  tracks theshort term sector of the United States   \n  Treasury market.                                   \n                                                     \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.03%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 54 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund\nis not required to purchase all of the securities\nrepresented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold\na portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. The Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of short term (1-3\nyears) public obligations of the U.S. Treasury. The Index\nincludes all publicly issued U.S. Treasury securities that\nhave a remaining maturity of greater than or equal\n\n122\n\nto 1 year and less than 3 years, are rated investment grade\nand have $300 million or more of outstanding face value. In\naddition, the securities must be denominated in U.S.\ndollars, fixed rate and non-convertible. Securities\nexcluded from the Index include state and local government\nseries bonds, inflation protected public obligations of the\nU.S. Treasury, commonly known as \u201cTIPS,\u201d floating rate\nbonds and coupon issues that have been stripped from bonds\nincluded in the Index. The Index is market capitalization\nweighted and the securities in the Index are updated on the\nlast business day of each month. As of July 31, 2024, there\nwere 96 securities in the Index and the dollar-weighted\naverage maturity of the securities in the Index was 1.96\nyears. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services\nLimited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines\nthe composition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other fixed income securities\nin their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and\nother characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to\nthe financial condition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be\ntimes when the market price of the shares is more than the\nnet asset value per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened\nin times of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to\nfalling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the\nsecurities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the\nFund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower\nrates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance of an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising the Index.\nThis differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the\nFund's performance may be less favorable than 123 that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the\nFund. Errors in index data, index computations or the\nconstruction of the Index in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period\nof time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the\nFund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include,\nand the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to\nthe component securities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction\ncosts and market exposure arising from such portfolio\nchanges will be borne directly by the Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Securities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or any investments made with cash collateral.\nThese events could also trigger adverse tax consequences\nfor the Fund. To the extent the collateral provided or\ninvestments made with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss than the\nsecurities included in the Index. Valuation Risk: Certain\nportfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors\nother than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio\nholding when market quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio holding at a point\nin time might differ from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. 124\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective April 30, 2018 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the Bloomberg 1-5 Year U.S. Treasury Index (the \u201cPrevious\nBenchmark Index\u201d) to the Bloomberg 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury Index, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the performance of the current index.

Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as\na 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement\nmay be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund\nShares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its\naffiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems,\nor other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund\nover another investment.

You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.12%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.12%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 18 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the\nBloomberg U.S. Government Inflation-Linked Bond Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the Index. The\nquantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the\nFund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the\nIndex in approximately the same proportions as the Index,\nas determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of\nthe Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser\ndetermines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of\nthe securities that comprise the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. The Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of the inflation\nprotected public obligations of the U.S. Treasury, commonly\nknown as \u201cTIPS.\u201d TIPS are securities issued by the U.S.\nTreasury that are designed to provide inflation\n\n127\n\nprotection to investors. The Index includes publicly issued\nTIPS that have at least 1 year remaining to maturity on the\nIndex rebalancing date, with an issue size equal to or in\nexcess of $500 million. Bonds must be capital-indexed and\nlinked to an eligible inflation index. The securities must\nbe denominated in U.S. dollars and pay coupon and principal\nin U.S. dollars. The notional coupon of a bond must be\nfixed or zero. Bonds must settle on or before the Index\nrebalancing date. The securities in the Index are updated\non the last business day of each month. As of July 31,\n2024, there were 48 securities in the Index. The Index is\nsponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The\nvalues of debt securities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest payments, or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that\ninterest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially slower than originally anticipated\nand the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income\nmarkets. During periods when interest rates are at low\nlevels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster\nthan originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying\ninterest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest\nrates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on\ninvestments in debt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including investments in equity\nsecurities. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk: U.S. Treasury\nobligations may differ from other fixed income securities\nin their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and\nother characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to\nthe financial condition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Inflation-Indexed Securities Risk:\nThe principal amount of an inflation-indexed security\ntypically increases with inflation and decreases with\ndeflation, as measured by a specified index. It is possible\nthat, in a period of declining inflation rates, the Fund\ncould receive at maturity less than the initial principal\namount of an inflation-indexed security. Changes in the\nvalues of inflation-indexed securities may be difficult to\npredict, and it is possible that an investment in such\nsecurities will have an effect different from that\nanticipated. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums\nand Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Income\nRisk: The Fund's income may decline due to falling interest\nrates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the\nFund may call or redeem the securities during periods of\nfalling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying lower interest\nrates. If an obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the\nFund may have to reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates. 128 Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or restrictions on\nresale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security\nat an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations\nin market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Securities Lending\nRisk: The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities\nlending involves the risk that the borrower of the loaned\nsecurities fails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose money due to a\ndecline in the value of collateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or any investments made with cash collateral.\nThese events could also trigger adverse tax consequences\nfor the Fund. To the extent the collateral provided or\ninvestments made with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss than the\nsecurities included in the Index. Valuation Risk: Certain\nportfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors\nother than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio\nholding when market quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio holding at a point\nin time might differ from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time. 129\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses1                        0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.03%  \n                                                \n1 \u201cOther expenses\u201d are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year. Example: This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated, and then sell or\nhold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. The Example reflects the\nFund's contractual fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement only in the periods for which the contractual fee\nwaiver and/or expense reimbursement is expected to continue. Although your actual costs may be higher or\nlower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities\n(or \u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and\nmay result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not\nreflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. From the\nFund's commencement of operations on May 22, 2024 to the most recent fiscal year end, the Fund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 2 % of the average value of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy In\nseeking to track the performance of the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and return characteristics of the Index. The quantity\nof holdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the\nFund's assets in substantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same\nproportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective.\n\n132\n\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total\nassets in the securities comprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser determines have economic\ncharacteristics that are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt securities that\nare not included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management purposes. The Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of public obligations of the U.S. Treasury. The Index includes all\npublicly issued U.S. Treasury securities that have a remaining maturity of greater than or equal to 1 year,\nare rated investment grade and have $300 million or more of outstanding face value. In addition, the\nsecurities must be denominated in U.S. dollars, fixed rate and non-convertible. Securities excluded from the\nIndex include state and local government series bonds, inflation protected public obligations of the U.S.\nTreasury, commonly known as \u201cTIPS,\u201d floating rate bonds, and coupon issues that have been stripped from\nbonds included in the Index. The Index is market capitalization weighted and the securities in the Index are\nreconstituted and rebalanced on the last business day of each month. As of July 31, 2024, there were 288\nsecurities in the Index and the dollar-weighted average maturity of the securities in the Index was 7.80\nyears. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of the Index,\nrelative weightings of the securities in the Index and publishes information regarding the market value of\nthe Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As with all investments, there are certain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any\nother government agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets.\nInvestment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes\nin the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject to\nthe risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies and\nmarkets. Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural\ndisasters, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its investments. Debt Securities Risk: The values of debt securities may\nincrease or decrease as a result of the following: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or\nperceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that interest rates\nrise, certain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially slower than originally anticipated and\nthe value of those securities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate environment may cause the value of\nthe Fund's fixed income securities to decrease, an adverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and increased volatility of the fixed income markets. During periods when interest rates\nare at low levels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating basis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain underlying obligations may be\npaid off substantially faster than originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the prepayments of principal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling interest rates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the values of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities could trail the returns on other investment options, including\ninvestments in equity securities. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk: U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from\nother fixed income securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other\ncharacteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S.\ngovernment may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and\nsold in the secondary market at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there may be times when the market price of the\nshares is more than the net asset value per share (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market volatility or periods of steep market declines. 133\nIncome Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to falling interest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by the Fund may call or redeem the securities during periods of falling interest rates, and\nthe Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities paying lower interest rates. If an obligation\nheld by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the prepayment in other obligations paying income\nat lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current\nor projected performance of the Index or of the actual securities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or\nthe construction of the Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be\nidentified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse\nimpact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not\nalign with the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to the component securities of\nthe Index and the Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect\nchanges in the securities included in the Index. The Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Fund's return\nmay not match the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. In addition, the Fund may not be fully invested at\ntimes, generally as a result of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to\nmeet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities not included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of\ndivergence between the Fund's return and that of the Index. Limited Track Record Risk: The Fund has a\nlimited track record and there is no assurance that the Fund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading volume, which could lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing\nexchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause elevated transaction costs for the Fund and\nnegative tax consequences for its shareholders. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market\nconditions, or restrictions on resale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more\nliquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's\nholdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's\nholdings may also limit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid investments and/or the difficulty in\npurchasing and selling such investments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Securities Lending Risk: The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending\ninvolves the risk that the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could also lose money due to a decline in the value of collateral provided for\nloaned securities or any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax\nconsequences for the Fund. To the extent the collateral provided or investments made with cash collateral\ndiffer from securities included in the Index, such collateral or investments may have a greater risk of loss\nthan the securities included in the Index. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on the\nbasis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or\nreduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including\n\u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next\nthan if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close\nout a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation\nestablished by the Fund at that time. 134 Fund Performance The Fund has not yet completed a full calendar\nyear of operations and therefore does not report its performance history. Once the Fund has completed a full\ncalendar year of operations, a bar chart and table will be included that will provide some indication of the\nrisks of investing in the Fund by showing the variability of the Fund's returns based on net assets and\ncomparing the Fund's performance to the Index. When available, updated performance information may be\nobtained by calling 1-866-787-2257 or visiting the Fund's website: https://www.ssga.com . Portfolio\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio Managers The\nprofessionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Joanna Madden, Cynthia Moy\nand James Kramer. Joanna Madden is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed\nIncome Beta Solutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2003. Cynthia Moy is a Principal of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2007. James Kramer is\na Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He\njoined the Adviser in 1996. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of\nFund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit\nor delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the \u201cExchange\u201d), other national securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because\nFund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to\npay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask)\n(the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts,\nand bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are\nexpected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create\na conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to\nrecommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's\nwebsite for more information. 135 Additional Strategies Information Principal Strategies General . Please\nsee each Fund's \u201cThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund Summaries\u201d above for a\ndiscussion of each Fund's principal investment strategies. A Fund may invest in various types of securities\nand engage in various investment techniques which are not the principal focus of the Fund and therefore are\nnot described in this Prospectus. These securities, techniques and practices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional Information (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain free of charge by\ncontacting shareholder services (see the back cover of this Prospectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of each Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e ., obtain a high\ndegree of correlation with the Index). A number of factors may affect a Fund's ability to achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with its Index, and there can be no guarantee that a Fund will achieve a high degree\nof correlation. For example, a Fund may not be able to achieve a high degree of correlation with its Index\nwhen there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved in compiling a portfolio of securities\nto follow the Index, when a security in the Index becomes temporarily illiquid, unavailable or less liquid,\nor legal restrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from investing in a security in the Index. The Adviser\nwill utilize a sampling strategy in managing the Funds. Sampling means that the Adviser uses quantitative\nanalysis to select securities, including securities in the Index, outside of the Index and derivatives that\nhave a similar investment profile as the relevant Index in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes\nand other economic characteristics. These include industry weightings, market capitalization, and other\nfinancial characteristics of securities. The quantity of holdings in a Fund will be based on a number of\nfactors, including asset size of the Fund. In addition, from time to time, securities are added to or\nremoved from each Index. The Adviser may sell securities that are represented in an Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in an Index, in anticipation of their removal from or addition to an\nIndex. Further, the Adviser may choose to overweight securities in an Index, purchase or sell securities not\nin an Index, or utilize various combinations of other available techniques, in seeking to track an Index.\nThe SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg High Yield Municipal Bond ETF, SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg Municipal Bond ETF and SPDR\nNuveen Bloomberg Short Term Municipal Bond ETF (each a \u201cMunicipal Bond ETF,\u201d collectively the \u201cMunicipal\nBond ETFs\u201d) have adopted a fundamental investment policy and certain of the other Funds as described in the\nSAI, have adopted a non-fundamental investment policy to invest at least 80% of their respective net assets,\nplus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in investments suggested by their respective names,\nmeasured at the time of investment. A Fund will provide shareholders with at least 60 days' notice prior to\nany change in this non-fundamental 80% investment policy. Any change to a Municipal Bond ETF's fundamental\n80% investment policy will require shareholder approval. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d)\nmay change a Fund's investment strategy, Index and other policies without shareholder approval, except as\notherwise indicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI. The Board may also change a Fund's investment\nobjective without shareholder approval. Non-Principal Strategies Certain Other Investments . Each Fund may\ninvest in structured notes (notes on which the amount of principal repayment and interest payments are based\non the movement of one or more specified factors such as the movement of a particular security or index),\nswaps, options and futures contracts. Swaps, options and futures contracts and structured notes may be used\nby a Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to its Index and in managing cash flows. Temporary\nDefensive Positions . In certain situations or market conditions, a Fund may temporarily depart from its\nnormal investment policies and strategies, provided that the alternative is consistent with the Fund's\ninvestment objective and is in the best interest of the Fund. For example, a Fund may make larger than\nnormal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure to its Index if it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . Each Fund may borrow money from a bank as permitted by the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing statute, by the rules thereunder, or by the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund, but\nonly for temporary or emergency purposes. The 1940 Act presently allows a Fund to borrow from any bank\n(including pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets (not\nincluding temporary borrowings not in excess 136 of 5% of its total assets). A Fund may also invest in\nreverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions. Consistent with a rule under the 1940 Act,\na Fund may treat such investments as either borrowings or derivatives transactions. To the extent a Fund\ntreats reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions as borrowings, such investments will\nalso be included in the 33 1/3% limit. Under normal circumstances, any borrowings by a Fund (including\ninvestments in reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions treated as borrowings) will\nnot exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. Lending of Securities . Each Fund may lend its portfolio\nsecurities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets via a securities lending program\nthrough its securities lending agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d or the \u201cLending\nAgent\u201d), to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions desiring to borrow securities to complete\ntransactions and for other purposes. A securities lending program allows a Fund to receive a portion of the\nincome generated by lending its securities and investing the respective collateral. A Fund will receive\ncollateral for each loaned security which is at least equal to the market value of that security, marked to\nmarket each trading day. To the extent a Fund receives cash collateral, as of the date of this Prospectus,\nthe Adviser expects to invest such cash collateral in a fund managed by the Adviser that invests in: a broad\nrange of money market instruments; certificates of deposit and time deposits of U.S. and foreign banks;\ncommercial paper and other high quality obligations of U.S. or foreign companies; asset-backed securities;\nmortgage-related securities; repurchase agreements; and shares of money market funds. With respect to loans\nthat are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash\ncollateral. A Fund is compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash\ncollateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is\ncompensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned\nsecurities. In the securities lending program, the borrower generally has the right to vote the loaned\nsecurities; however, a Fund may call loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the Fund's economic\ninterest in the investment is to be voted upon. Security loans may be terminated at any time by a Fund.\nAdditional Risk Information The following section provides information regarding the principal risks\nidentified under \u201cPrincipal Risks of Investing in the Fund\u201d in each Fund Summary along with additional risk\ninformation.

Securities Risk . Securities rated below investment-grade and unrated securities of\ncomparable credit quality (commonly known as \u201chigh-yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds) lack strong investment-grade\ncharacteristics, are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to\nmake principal and interest payments, and are subject to greater levels of credit, liquidity and market risk\nthan higher-rated securities. They can involve a substantially greater risk of default than higher-rated\nsecurities, and their values can decline significantly over short periods of time. Issuers of lower-quality\ndebt securities may have substantially greater risk of insolvency or bankruptcy than issuers of higher-\nquality debt securities. In the event the issuer of a debt security held by a Fund defaults on its payments\nor becomes insolvent or bankrupt, the Fund may not receive the return it was promised on the investment and\ncould lose its entire investment. The lower ratings of junk bonds reflect a greater possibility that actual\nor perceived adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer or in general economic conditions, or\nan unanticipated rise in interest rates, may impair the ability of the issuer to make payments of interest\nand principal. If this were to occur, the values of such securities held by a Fund may fall substantially\nand a Fund could lose some or all of the value of its investment. Lower-quality debt securities tend to be\nmore sensitive to adverse news about the issuer, or the market or economy in general, than higher quality\ndebt securities. The market for lower quality debt securities can be less liquid than for higher quality\ndebt securities, especially during periods of recession or general market decline, which could make it\ndifficult at times for a Fund to sell certain securities at prices used in calculating a Fund's net asset\nvalue. These securities may have significant volatility. Call/Prepayment Risk . Call/prepayment risk is the\nrisk that an issuer will exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation held by a Fund earlier than\nexpected or required. This may occur, for example, when there is a decline in interest rates, and an issuer\nof bonds or preferred stock redeems the bonds or stock in order to replace them with obligations on which it\nis required to pay a lower interest or dividend rate. It may also occur when there is an unanticipated\nincrease in the rate at which mortgages or other receivables underlying mortgage- or asset-backed securities\nheld by a Fund are prepaid. In any such case, a Fund may be forced to invest the prepaid amounts in lower-\nyielding investments, resulting in a decline in the Fund's income. Cash Transaction Risk . To the extent a\nFund sells portfolio securities to meet some or all of a redemption request with cash, the Fund may incur\ntaxable gains or losses that it might not have incurred had it made redemptions entirely in-kind. As a\nresult, a Fund may pay out higher annual capital gain distributions than if the in-kind redemption process\nwas used. Consumer Cyclical Sector Risk . Companies in the consumer cyclical sector are largely impacted by\nthe performance of the overall global economy, changes in interest rates, fluctuations in supply and demand,\nand changes in consumer preferences. Success depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer\nspending. As a result, consumer cyclical companies may be adversely affected and lose value quickly in\nperiods of economic downturns. Also, companies in the consumer cyclical sector may be subject to severe\ncompetition, which may have an adverse impact on their respective profitability. Convertible Securities Risk\n. Convertible securities are bonds, debentures, notes, preferred stocks or other securities that may be\nconverted or exchanged (by the holder or by the issuer, depending on the terms of the securities) into\nshares of the underlying common stock (or cash or securities of equivalent value) at a stated exchange\nratio. Convertible securities may be subordinate to other debt securities issued by the same issuer. Issuers\nof convertible securities are often not as strong financially as issuers with higher credit ratings.\nConvertible securities typically provide yields lower than comparable non-convertible securities. Their\nvalues may be more volatile than those of non-convertible securities, reflecting changes in the values of\nthe securities into which they are convertible. Counterparty Risk . A Fund will be subject to credit risk\nwith respect to the counterparties with which the Fund enters into derivatives contracts and other\ntransactions such as repurchase agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. A Fund's ability to profit from\nthese types of investments and transactions will depend on the willingness and ability of its counterparty\nto perform its obligations. If a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, a Fund may be\nunable to terminate or realize any gain on the investment or transaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund. A\nFund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its counterparty (including recovery of any collateral posted by it) and\nmay obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances. If a Fund holds\ncollateral posted by its counterparty, it may be delayed or prevented from realizing on the collateral in\nthe event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding relating to the counterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if a Fund enters into an investment or 145 transaction with a financial\ninstitution and such financial institution (or an affiliate of the financial institution) experiences\nfinancial difficulties, then the Fund may in certain situations be prevented or delayed from exercising its\nrights to terminate the investment or transaction, or to realize on any collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations of the parties under such investment or transactions or in\nanother institution being substituted for that financial institution without the consent of the Fund.\nFurther, a Fund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under applicable law whereby, if required by the financial\ninstitution's authority, the financial institution's liabilities could be written down, eliminated or\nconverted into equity or an alternative instrument of ownership. A bail-in of a financial institution may\nresult in a reduction in value of some or all of its securities and, if a Fund holds such securities or has\nentered into a transaction with such a financial security when a bail-in occurs, such Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Credit Risk . Credit risk is the risk that an issuer, guarantor or liquidity provider of\na fixed-income security held by a Fund may be unable or unwilling, or may be perceived (whether by market\nparticipants, ratings agencies, pricing services or otherwise) as unable or unwilling, to make timely\nprincipal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. It includes the risk that the\nsecurity will be downgraded by a credit rating agency; generally, lower credit quality issuers present\nhigher credit risks. An actual or perceived decline in creditworthiness of an issuer of a fixed-income\nsecurity held by a Fund may result in a decrease in the value of the security. It is possible that the\nability of an issuer to meet its obligations will decline substantially during the period when a Fund owns\nsecurities of the issuer or that the issuer will default on its obligations or that the obligations of the\nissuer will be limited or restructured. The credit rating assigned to any particular investment does not\nnecessarily reflect the issuer's current financial condition and does not reflect an assessment of an\ninvestment's volatility or liquidity. Securities rated in the lowest category of investment-grade are\nconsidered to have speculative characteristics. If a security held by a Fund loses its rating or its rating\nis downgraded, the Fund may nonetheless continue to hold the security in the discretion of the Adviser. In\nthe case of asset-backed or mortgage-related securities, changes in the actual or perceived ability of the\nobligors on the underlying assets or mortgages to make payments of interest and/or principal may affect the\nvalues of those securities. Debt Securities Risk . The values of debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market fluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or perceived inability or\nunwillingness of issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments\nor illiquidity in debt securities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest rate environment may cause the value of a Fund's fixed income\nsecurities to decrease, a decline in a Fund's income and yield, an adverse impact on the liquidity of a\nFund's fixed income securities, and increased volatility of the fixed income markets. During periods when\ninterest rates are at low levels, a Fund's yield can be low, and a Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it\nmay lose money on an operating basis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain underlying\nobligations may be paid off substantially faster than originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of principal may have to be reinvested in obligations\npaying interest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest rates, the income received by a Fund may\ndecline. Changes in interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the values of debt securities of\nlonger durations. Returns on investments in debt securities could trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity securities. High levels of inflation and/or a significantly\nchanging interest rate environment can lead to heightened levels of volatility and reduced liquidity.\nDerivatives Risk. A derivative is a financial contract the value of which depends on, or is derived from,\nthe value of an underlying asset, interest rate, or index. Derivative transactions typically involve\nleverage and may have significant volatility. It is possible that a derivative transaction will result in a\nloss greater than the principal amount invested, and a Fund may not be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price. Risks associated with derivative instruments include potential\nchanges in value in response to interest rate changes or other market developments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential for the derivative transaction not to have the effect the\nAdviser anticipated or a different or less favorable effect than the Adviser anticipated; the failure of the\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction to perform its obligations under the transaction or to settle a\ntrade; possible mispricing or improper valuation of the derivative instrument; imperfect correlation in the\nvalue of a derivative with the asset, rate, or index underlying the derivative; the risk that a Fund may be\nrequired to post collateral or margin with its counterparty, and will not be able to recover the collateral\nor margin in the event of the counterparty's insolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will experience\nlosses on its derivatives investments and on its other portfolio investments, even when 146 the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or entirely to hedge those portfolio investments; the risks specific to\nthe asset underlying the derivative instrument; lack of liquidity for the derivative instrument, including,\nwithout limitation, absence of a secondary trading market; the potential for reduced returns to a Fund due\nto losses on the transaction and an increase in volatility; the potential for the derivative transaction to\nhave the effect of accelerating the recognition of gain; and legal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. Futures Contract Risk . The risk of loss relating to the use of\nfutures contracts is potentially unlimited. The ability to establish and close out positions in futures\ncontracts will be subject to the development and maintenance of a liquid secondary market. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange will exist for any particular futures contract or at\nany particular time. In the event no such market exists, it might not be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and a Fund will be unable to terminate the futures contract. In using futures contracts, a\nFund will be reliant on the ability of the Adviser to predict market and price movements correctly; the\nskills needed to use such futures contracts successfully are different from those needed for traditional\nportfolio management. If a Fund uses futures contracts for hedging purposes, there is a risk of imperfect\ncorrelation between movements in the prices of the futures contracts and movements in the securities or\nindex underlying the futures contracts or movements in the prices of the Fund's investments that are the\nsubject of such hedge. The prices of futures contracts, for a number of reasons, may not correlate perfectly\nwith movements in the securities or index underlying them. For example, participants in the futures markets\nare subject to margin deposit requirements. Such requirements may cause investors to take actions with\nrespect to their futures positions that they would not otherwise take. The margin requirements in the\nfutures markets may be less onerous than margin requirements in the securities markets in general, and as a\nresult those markets may attract more speculators than the securities markets do. Increased participation by\nspeculators in those markets may cause temporary price distortions. Due to the possibility of price\ndistortion, even a correct forecast of general market trends by the Adviser still may not result in a\nsuccessful futures activity over a very short time period. The risk of a position in a futures contract may\nbe very large compared to the relatively low level of margin a Fund is required to deposit. A Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its futures commission merchant in connection with its\ntransactions in futures contracts. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract\nmay result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to the size of a required\nmargin deposit. A Fund will incur brokerage fees in connection with its futures transactions. In the event\nof an insolvency of the futures commission merchant or a clearing house, a Fund may not be able to recover\nall (or any) of the margin it has posted with the futures commission merchant, or to realize the value of\nany increase in the price of its positions, or it may experience a significant delay in doing so. The\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have established limits referred\nto as \u201cspeculative position limits\u201d on the maximum net long or net short positions that any person and\ncertain affiliated entities may hold or control in a particular futures contract. In addition, federal\nposition limits apply to swaps that are economically equivalent to futures contracts that are subject to\nCFTC-set speculative limits. All positions owned or controlled by the same person or entity, even if in\ndifferent accounts, must be aggregated for purposes of complying with position limits. It is possible that\nthe positions of different clients managed by the Adviser may be aggregated for this purpose. Therefore, the\ntrading decisions of the Adviser may have to be modified and positions held by a Fund liquidated in order to\navoid exceeding such limits. The modification of investment decisions or the elimination of open positions,\nif it occurs, may adversely affect the performance of a Fund. A violation of position limits could also lead\nto regulatory action materially adverse to a Fund's investment strategy. In addition, exchanges may\nestablish accountability levels applicable to a futures contract instead of position limits, provided that\nthe futures contract is not subject to federal position limits. An exchange may order a person who holds or\ncontrols a position in excess of a position accountability level not to further increase its position, to\ncomply with any prospective limit that exceeds the size of the position owned or controlled, or to reduce\nany open position that exceeds the position accountability level if the exchange determines that such action\nis necessary to maintain an orderly market. Position accountability levels could adversely affect a Fund's\nability to establish and maintain positions in commodity futures contracts to which such levels apply, if\nthe Fund were to trade in such contracts, and a Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective. Futures\ncontracts traded on markets outside the U.S. are not generally subject to the same level of regulation by\nthe CFTC or other U.S. regulatory entities as contracts traded in the U.S., including without limitation as\nto the execution, delivery, and clearing of transactions. U.S. regulators neither regulate the activities of\na foreign exchange, nor have the power to compel enforcement of the rules of the foreign exchange or the\nlaws of the foreign country in question. Margin and other payments made by a Fund may not be afforded the\nsame protections 147 as are afforded those payments in the U.S., including in connection with the insolvency\nof an executing or clearing broker or a clearinghouse or exchange. Certain foreign futures contracts may be\nless liquid and more volatile than U.S. contracts. Swaps Risk. A swap is a two-party contract that generally\nobligates the parties to exchange payments based on a specified reference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can involve greater risks than direct investment in securities\nbecause swaps may be leveraged and are subject to counterparty risk ( e.g. , the risk of a counterparty's\ndefaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk ( i.e. , swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). Swaps may also be considered illiquid. It may not be possible for a Fund to liquidate a swap\nposition at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses. Emerging Markets Risk .\nInvestments in emerging markets are generally subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in\ndeveloped markets. This may be due to, among other things, the possibility of greater market volatility,\nlower trading volume and liquidity, greater risk of expropriation, nationalization, and social, political\nand economic instability, greater reliance on a few industries, international trade or revenue from\nparticular commodities, less developed accounting, legal and regulatory systems, increased potential for\nmarket manipulation, higher levels of inflation, deflation or currency devaluation, greater risk of market\nshutdown, and more significant governmental limitations on investment policy as compared to those typically\nfound in a developed market. There may be limited legal rights and remedies for investors in companies\ndomiciled in emerging markets. In addition, issuers (including governments) in emerging market countries may\nhave less financial stability than in other countries. The securities of emerging market companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Market disruptions or substantial\nmarket corrections may limit very significantly the liquidity of securities of certain companies in a\nparticular country or geographic region, or of all companies in the country or region. A Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its positions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the\nFund's obligations. There is also the potential for unfavorable action such as embargo and acts of war. As a\nresult, there will tend to be an increased risk of price volatility in investments in emerging market\ncountries, which may be magnified by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Settlement and asset\ncustody practices for transactions in emerging markets may differ from those in developed markets. Such\ndifferences may include possible delays in settlement and certain settlement practices, such as delivery of\nsecurities prior to receipt of payment, which increase the likelihood of a \u201cfailed settlement.\u201d Failed\nsettlements can result in losses. For these and other reasons, investments in emerging markets are often\nconsidered speculative. Extension Risk. During periods of rising interest rates, the average life of certain\ntypes of securities may be extended because of slower-than-expected principal payments. This may increase\nthe period of time during which an investment earns a below-market interest rate, increase the security's\nduration and reduce the value of the security. Extension risk may be heightened during periods of adverse\neconomic conditions generally, as payment rates decline due to higher unemployment levels and other factors.\nFinancial Sector Risk. Financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which\nmay limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, the interest\nrates and fees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition. In addition,\ndeterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause an unusually\nhigh degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain financial\nservices companies to incur large losses. Securities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the valuations of their\nassets, take action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or cease\noperations. Credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated\nwith investment activities can negatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be subject to severe\nprice competition. Adverse economic, business or political developments could adversely affect financial\ninstitutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. 148 Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk\n. The net asset value of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of a Fund's\nsecurities holdings. The market prices of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in\na Fund's net asset value and supply and demand of Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be predicted\nwhether Fund Shares will trade below, at or above their net asset value. Price differences may be due, in\nlarge part, to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the\nsecurities of an Index trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in time. The market prices of\nFund Shares may deviate significantly from the net asset value of Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units (unlike shares of\nmany closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to,\ntheir net asset value), the Adviser (and Sub-Adviser, as applicable) believe that large discounts or\npremiums to the net asset value of Fund Shares should not be sustained over long periods. While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to make it likely that Fund Shares normally will trade close to a\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to creations and redemptions or market volatility may result in trading\nprices that differ significantly from such Fund's net asset value. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at a\ntime when the market price is at a premium to the net asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a time when the\nmarket price is at a discount to the net asset value of Fund Shares, then the investor may sustain losses.\nGeographic Focus Risk . The performance of a fund that invests significantly in one or more countries or\ngeographic regions will be closely tied to market, currency, economic, political, environmental, or\nregulatory conditions and developments in the countries or regions in which the fund invests, and may be\nmore volatile than the performance of a fund that does not invest significantly in such countries or\nregions. Europe . The Economic and Monetary Union of the EU requires compliance with restrictions on\ninflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every country in Europe. Decreasing imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU\nregulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU\ncountries), the default or threat of default by an EU member country on its sovereign debt, and/or an\neconomic recession in an EU member country may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU\nmember countries and their trading partners. The European financial markets have recently experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in\nseveral European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. These events have\nadversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect every country in\nEurope, including countries that do not use the euro. Responses to the financial problems by European\ngovernments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired\nresults, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other\nunintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt\ncould have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world.\nIn addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. For example, on January\n31, 2020, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) formally withdrew from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and,\nafter a transition period, left the EU single market and customs union under the terms of a new trade\nagreement on December 31, 2020. The agreement governs the new relationship between the UK and EU with\nrespect to trading goods and services, but critical aspects of the relationship remain unresolved and\nsubject to further negotiation and agreement. Certain aspects of Brexit have had an adverse impact on the\nregion, leading to increased inflation, labor shortages and business closures, among others. The full scope\nand nature of the consequences of the exit are not at this time known and are unlikely to be known for a\nsignificant period of time. It is also unknown whether the UK's exit will increase the likelihood of other\ncountries also departing the EU. Any exits from the EU, or the possibility of such exits, may have a\nsignificant impact on the UK, Europe, and global economies, which may result in increased volatility and\nilliquidity, new legal and regulatory uncertainties and potentially lower economic growth for such economies\nthat could potentially have an adverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments. In addition, a number\nof countries in Europe have suffered terrorist attacks and additional attacks may occur in the future. Such\nattacks may cause uncertainty in financial markets and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers\nto which the Fund has exposure. 149 Income Risk. A Fund's income may decline due to falling interest rates\nor other factors. Issuers of securities held by a Fund may call or redeem the securities during periods of\nfalling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities paying lower\ninterest rates. If an obligation held by a Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the prepayment in\nother obligations paying income at lower rates. A reduction in the income earned by a Fund may limit the\nFund's ability to achieve its objective. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk . Each Fund is managed with\nan indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities.\nEach Fund will seek to provide investment results that correspond generally to the performance of the Index,\nregardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of the actual securities comprising the\nIndex. This differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index.\nEach Fund generally will buy and will not sell a security included in the Index as long as the security is\npart of the Index regardless of any sudden or material decline in value or foreseeable material decline in\nvalue of the security, even though the Adviser may make a different investment decision for other actively\nmanaged accounts or portfolios that hold the security. As a result, a Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The structure and\ncomposition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index (in absolute terms\nand by comparison with other indices) and, consequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of a Fund.\nErrors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Index in accordance with its methodology\nmay occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of\ntime or at all, which may have an adverse impact on a Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, an Index may include, and the corresponding Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align with the Index's objective and/or criteria. While\nthe Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex), a Fund's return may not match the return of the Index for a number of reasons. For example, the\nreturn on the sample of securities purchased by a Fund (or the return on securities not included in the\nIndex) may not correlate precisely with the return of the Index. Each Fund incurs a number of operating\nexpenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. In addition, a Fund\nmay not be fully invested at times, either as a result of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in\nfewer than all of the securities in the Index, or in some securities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between a Fund's return and that of the Index. Changes in the composition\nof the Index and regulatory requirements also may impact a Fund's ability to match the return of the Index.\nThe Adviser may apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment techniques to refine or limit the number or types\nof issuers included in the Index in which a Fund may invest. Application of such screens or techniques may\nresult in investment performance below that of the Index and may not produce results expected by the\nAdviser. Index tracking risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual\nmarket conditions. Pursuant to each Index methodology, a security may be removed from an Index in the event\nthat it does not comply with the eligibility requirements of the Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced to\nsell securities at inopportune times and/or unfavorable prices due to these changes in the Index components.\nWhen there are changes made to the component securities of an Index and the corresponding Fund in turn makes\nsimilar changes to its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund's portfolio and the\nIndex, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly\nby the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled changes to an Index may expose the corresponding Fund to\nadditional tracking error risk. A Fund may recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the securities included in the corresponding Index. A Fund also\nmay be required to distribute any such gains to its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. Industrial Sector Risk . Industrial companies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector products and services in general. Government\nregulation, world events, exchange rates and economic conditions, technological developments and liabilities\nfor environmental damage and general civil liabilities will likewise affect the performance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of the industrial sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant\nextent, on U.S. and foreign government demand for their products and services. Thus, the financial condition\nof, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by 150 governmental\ndefense spending policies which are typically under pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another component of the industrial sector, are cyclical and\nhave occasional sharp price movements which may result from changes in the economy, fuel prices, labor\nagreements and insurance costs. Inflation-Indexed Securities Risk . The principal amount of an inflation-\nindexed security typically increases with inflation and decreases with deflation, as measured by a specified\nindex. It is possible that, in a period of declining inflation rates, a Fund could receive at maturity less\nthan the initial principal amount of an inflation-indexed security. Although the holders of U.S. TIPS\nreceive no less than the par value of the security at maturity, if a Fund purchases U.S. TIPS in the\nsecondary market whose principal values have previously been adjusted upward and there is a period of\nsubsequent declining inflation rates, a Fund may receive at maturity less than it invested. Depending on the\nchanges in inflation rates during the period a Fund holds an inflation-indexed security, a Fund may earn\nless on the security than on a conventional bond. The principal amounts of inflation-indexed securities are\ntypically only adjusted periodically, and changes in the values of the securities may only approximately\nreflect changes in inflation rates and may occur substantially after the changes in inflation rates in\nquestion occur. Interest Rate Risk . Interest rate risk is the risk that the securities held by a Fund will\ndecline in value because of increases in market interest rates. Duration is a measure used to determine the\nsensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. Debt securities with longer durations tend\nto be more sensitive to changes in interest rates, usually making them more volatile than debt securities\nwith shorter durations. For example, the value of a security with a duration of five years would be expected\nto decrease by 5% for every 1% increase in interest rates. Falling interest rates also create the potential\nfor a decline in a Fund's income and yield. Interest-only and principal-only securities are especially\nsensitive to interest rate changes, which can affect not only their prices but can also change the income\nflows and repayment assumptions about those investments. Variable and floating rate securities also\ngenerally increase or decrease in value in response to changes in interest rates, although generally to a\nlesser degree than fixed-rate securities. A substantial increase in interest rates may also have an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of a security, especially those with longer durations. Interest rate changes can be\nsudden and unpredictable, and are influenced by a number of factors, including government policy, monetary\npolicy, inflation expectations, perceptions of risk, and supply and demand for bonds. Changes in government\nor central bank policy, including changes in tax policy or changes in a central bank's implementation of\nspecific policy goals, may have a substantial impact on interest rates. This could lead to heightened levels\nof interest rate, volatility and liquidity risks for the fixed income markets generally and could have a\nsubstantial and immediate effect on the values of a Fund's investments. There can be no guarantee that any\nparticular government or central bank policy will be continued, discontinued or changed, nor that any such\npolicy will have the desired effect on interest rates. Less Experienced Index Provider Risk . The Index was\ncreated by and is owned and maintained by MarketAxess Technologies Inc.. MarketAxess Technologies Inc. has a\nlimited history of experience as an index provider, which may create additional risks for investing in the\nFund. There is no assurance that Index data, Index computations or Index construction will be free from\nerror, or that any such errors will be identified and corrected in a timely manner or at all. Leveraging\nRisk . Borrowing transactions, reverse repurchase agreements, certain derivatives transactions, securities\nlending transactions and other investment transactions such as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward\ncommitment transactions may create investment leverage. If a Fund engages in transactions that have a\nleveraging effect on the Fund's investment portfolio, the value of the Fund will be potentially more\nvolatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. This is because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base of assets than a Fund would otherwise have and so magnifies\nthe effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund's underlying assets. The use of leverage is\nconsidered to be a speculative investment practice and may result in losses to a Fund. Certain derivatives\nhave the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial investment. The use of leverage\nmay cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to meet asset coverage requirements. Limited Track Record Risk .\nThe Fund has a limited track record and there is no assurance that the Fund will grow quickly. When the\nFund's size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume, which could lead to wider bid/ask spreads.\nIn addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of\nthe listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause elevated transaction costs for the\nFund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders. 151 Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk\nthat a Fund may not be able to dispose of investments readily at a favorable time or prices (or at all) or\nat prices approximating those at which a Fund currently values them. For example, certain investments may be\nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade in the over-the-counter market or in limited volume, or may not\nhave an active trading market. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. It may be difficult for a Fund to value\nilliquid investments accurately. The market for certain investments may become illiquid under adverse market\nor economic conditions independent of any specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer.\nIf the liquidity of a Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market price of\nFund Shares and the net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nDisposal of illiquid investments may entail registration expenses and other transaction costs that are\nhigher than those for liquid investments. A Fund may seek to borrow money to meet its obligations (including\namong other things redemption obligations) if it is unable to dispose of illiquid investments, resulting in\nborrowing expenses and possible leveraging of the Fund. Low Short-Term Interest Rates Risk . During market\nconditions in which short-term interest rates are at low levels, a Fund's yield can be very low, and a Fund\nmay have a negative yield ( i.e. , it may lose money on an operating basis). During these conditions, it is\npossible that a Fund will generate an insufficient amount of income to pay its expenses, and will not be\nable to pay its scheduled dividend. In addition, it is possible that during these conditions a Fund may\nexperience difficulties purchasing and/or selling securities with respect to scheduled rebalances, and may,\nas a result, maintain a portion of its assets in cash, on which it may earn little, if any, income. Such\nmarket conditions may adversely affect a Fund's ability to achieve a high degree of correlation with its\nIndex. Market Risk . Market prices of investments held by a Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. A Fund's investments are subject to changes in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets. Investment markets can be volatile,\nand prices of investments can change substantially due to various factors, including, but not limited to,\neconomic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation, changes in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market liquidity. Even if general economic conditions do not change,\nthe value of an investment in a Fund could decline if the particular industries, sectors or companies in\nwhich the Fund invests do not perform well or are adversely affected by events. Further, legal, political,\nregulatory and tax changes also may cause fluctuations in markets and securities prices. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues,\nor other events could have a significant impact on a Fund and its investments. Due to the interconnectedness\nof economies and financial markets throughout the world, whether or not a Fund invests in securities of\nissuers located in or with significant exposure to countries experiencing economic and financial\ndifficulties, the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments may be negatively affected. A widespread\noutbreak of an infectious illness, such as COVID-19, and efforts to contain its spread, may result in market\nvolatility, inflation, reduced liquidity of certain instruments, disruption in the trading of certain\ninstruments, and systemic economic weakness. The foregoing could impact a Fund and its investments and\nresult in disruptions to the services provided to a Fund by its service providers. Additionally, in March\n2023, the shutdown of certain financial institutions raised economic concerns over disruption in the U.S.\nbanking system. There can be no certainty that the actions taken by the U.S. government to strengthen public\nconfidence in the U.S. banking system will be effective in mitigating the effects of financial institution\nfailures on the economy and restoring public confidence in the U.S. banking system. Money Market Fund\nInvestment Risk . An investment in a money market fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or\nguaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Certain money market funds seek to preserve the value\nof their shares at $1.00 per share, although there can be no assurance that they will do so, and it is\npossible to lose money by investing in such a money market fund. A major or unexpected change in interest\nrates or a decline in the credit quality of an issuer or entity providing credit support, an inactive\ntrading market for money market instruments, or adverse market, economic, industry, political, regulatory,\ngeopolitical, and other conditions could cause the share price of such a money market fund to fall below\n$1.00. It is possible that such a money market fund will issue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at times\nwhen the fair value of the money market fund's portfolio per share is more or less than $1.00. None of State\nStreet Corporation, State Street, State Street Global Advisors, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates\n(collectively, the \u201cState Street Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an investment in a money market fund at\n$1.00 per share. Investors should have no expectation of capital support to a money market fund from the\nState Street Entities. Other money market funds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV that will fluctuate\n152 along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV may be\nworth more or less than their original purchase price. Recent changes in the regulation of money market\nfunds may affect the operations and structures of money market funds. A money market fund may be permitted\nor required to impose redemption fees during times of market stress. Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed\nSecurities Risk . Investments in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities are subject to the risk\nof significant credit downgrades, illiquidity, and defaults to a greater extent than many other types of\nfixed income investments. The liquidity of mortgage-related and asset-backed securities may change over\ntime. Mortgage-related securities represent a participation in, or are secured by, mortgage loans. Other\nasset-backed securities are typically structured like mortgage-related securities, but instead of mortgage\nloans or interests in mortgage loans, the underlying assets may include, for example, items such as motor\nvehicle installment sales or installment loan contracts, leases on various types of real and personal\nproperty, and receivables from credit card agreements. During periods of falling interest rates, mortgage-\nrelated and other asset-backed securities, which typically provide the issuer with the right to prepay the\nsecurity prior to maturity, may be prepaid, which may result in a Fund having to reinvest the proceeds in\nother investments at lower interest rates. During periods of rising interest rates, the average life of\nmortgage-related and other asset-backed securities may extend because of slower-than expected principal\npayments. This may lock in a below market interest rate, increase the security's duration and interest rate\nsensitivity, and reduce the value of the security. As a result, mortgage-related and other asset-backed\nsecurities may have less potential for capital appreciation during periods of declining interest rates than\nother debt securities of comparable maturities, although they may have a similar risk of decline in market\nvalues during periods of rising interest rates. Prepayment rates are difficult to predict and the potential\nimpact of prepayments on the value of a mortgage-related or other asset-backed security depends on the terms\nof the instrument and can result in significant volatility. The price of a mortgage-related or other asset-\nbacked security also depends on the credit quality and adequacy of the underlying assets or collateral.\nDefaults on the underlying assets, if any, may impair the value of a mortgage-related or other asset-backed\nsecurity. For some asset-backed securities in which a Fund invests, such as those backed by credit card\nreceivables, the underlying cash flows may not be supported by a security interest in a related asset.\nMoreover, the values of mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities may be substantially dependent on\nthe servicing of the underlying asset pools, and are therefore subject to risks associated with the\nnegligence or malfeasance by their servicers and to the credit risk of their servicers. In certain\nsituations, the mishandling of related documentation may also affect the rights of securities holders in and\nto the underlying collateral. There may be legal and practical limitations on the enforceability of any\nsecurity interest granted with respect to underlying assets, or the value of the underlying assets, if any,\nmay be insufficient if the issuer defaults. In a \u201cforward roll\u201d transaction, a Fund will sell a mortgage-\nrelated security to a bank or other permitted entity and simultaneously agree to purchase a similar security\nfrom the institution at a later date at an agreed upon price. The mortgage securities that are purchased\nwill bear the same interest rate as those sold, but generally will be collateralized by different pools of\nmortgages with different prepayment histories than those sold. The values of such transactions will be\naffected by many of the same factors that affect the values of mortgage-related securities generally. In\naddition, forward roll transactions may have the effect of creating investment leverage in a Fund. Municipal\nObligations Risk. The U.S. municipal securities market is volatile and can be significantly affected by\nadverse tax, legislative, or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal\nsecurities. Municipal obligations include revenue obligations, which are generally backed by the revenues\ngenerated from a specific project or facility and include private activity bonds and industrial development\nbonds. Private activity and industrial development bonds are dependent on the ability of the facility's user\nto meet its financial obligations and on the value of any real or personal property pledged as security for\nsuch payment. Private activity and industrial development bonds, although issued by industrial development\nauthorities, may be backed only by the assets of the non-governmental user. Because many municipal\nsecurities are issued to finance projects relating to education, health care, transportation and utilities,\nconditions in those sectors can affect the overall municipal securities market. In addition, municipal\nsecurities backed by current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific asset can be\nnegatively affected by the discontinuance or reduction in the rate of the taxation supporting the project or\nasset or the inability to collect revenues for the project or from the assets. If the U.S. Internal Revenue\nService (the \u201cIRS\u201d) determines the issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax\nrequirements, interest from the security could become taxable, and the security could decline in value.\nMunicipal obligations may also be subject to prepayment risk and extension risk. Certain states and other\ngovernmental entities have experienced, and may 153 continue to experience, extreme financial pressures in\nresponse to financial, economic and other factors, and may be, or be perceived to be, unable to meet all of\ntheir obligations under municipal bonds issued or guaranteed by them; such factors may result in substantial\nvolatility in municipal securities markets and losses to the corresponding Fund. Additionally, a Fund's\nportfolio may have greater exposure to liquidity risk since the markets for such securities may be less\nliquid than the traditional bond markets. There may also be less information available on the financial\ncondition of issuers of these types of securities than for public corporations. This means that it may be\nharder to buy and sell such securities, especially on short notice, and these securities may be more\ndifficult for a Fund to value accurately than securities of public corporations. Non-Diversification Risk .\nFunds classified as \u201cnon-diversified\u201d may hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many other\nfunds. To the extent a Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a decline in the market value\nof a particular security held by the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested in a larger number\nof issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. A Fund may become diversified for periods of time solely as a result of tracking its Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component securities). The SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets USD Bond ETF\nmay become non-diversified for periods of time solely as a result of tracking its Index. Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk . Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers entail risks not typically associated with investing in\nsecurities of U.S. issuers. Similar risks may apply to securities traded on a U.S. securities exchange that\nare issued by entities with significant exposure to non-U.S. countries. In certain countries, legal remedies\navailable to investors may be more limited than those available with regard to U.S. investments. Because\nnon-U.S. securities are typically denominated and traded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the value\nof a Fund's assets, to the extent they are non-U.S. dollar denominated, may be affected favorably or\nunfavorably by currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations, and restrictions or prohibitions on\nthe repatriation of non-U.S. currencies. To the extent underlying securities held by the Fund trade on\nforeign exchanges that are closed when the exchange on which the Fund's shares trade is open, there may be\ndeviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying\nsecurity on the closed foreign market. These deviations could result in the Fund experiencing premiums or\ndiscounts greater than those of ETFs that invest in domestic securities. Income and gains with respect to\ninvestments in certain countries may be subject to withholding and other taxes. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S. entities\nare not subject to accounting, auditing, and financial reporting standards, regulatory framework and\npractices comparable to those in the United States. The securities of some non-U.S. entities are less liquid\nand at times more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. entities, and could become subject to\nsanctions or embargoes that adversely affect a Fund's investment. Non-U.S. transaction costs, such as\nbrokerage commissions and custody costs may be higher than in the U.S. In addition, there may be a\npossibility of nationalization or expropriation of assets, imposition of currency exchange controls,\nconfiscatory taxation, and diplomatic developments that could adversely affect the values of a Fund's\ninvestments in issuers in certain non-U.S. countries. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers also are\nsubject to foreign political and economic risk not associated with U.S. investments, meaning that political\nevents (civil unrest, national elections, changes in political conditions and foreign relations, imposition\nof exchange controls and repatriation restrictions), social and economic events (labor strikes, rising\ninflation) and natural disasters occurring in a country where a Fund invests could cause the Fund's\ninvestments to experience gains or losses. Certain countries may institute negative interest rates on\ncertain fixed-income securities, and similar interest rate conditions may be experienced in other regions.\nInvestments in fixed-income securities with very low or negative interest rates may magnify a Fund's\nsusceptibility to interest rate risk and diminish yield and performance, and such investments may be subject\nto heightened volatility and reduced liquidity. Political Risk. A significant restructuring of federal\nincome tax rates or even serious discussion on the topic in Congress could cause municipal bond prices to\nfall. The demand for municipal securities is strongly influenced by the value of tax-exempt income to\ninvestors. Lower income tax rates could reduce the advantage of owning municipals. Portfolio Turnover Risk .\nA Fund may engage in frequent trading of its portfolio securities. Fund turnover generally involves a number\nof direct and indirect costs and expenses to a Fund, including, for example, brokerage commissions, dealer\nmark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestment in other\nsecurities. The costs related to increased portfolio turnover have the effect of reducing a Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities by the Fund may result in the realization of taxable capital\ngains, including 154 short-term capital gains. A Fund may engage in significant trading of its portfolio\nsecurities in connection with Index rebalancing. Frequent or significant trading may cause a Fund to incur\nadditional transaction costs and experience different tax consequences in comparison to an ETF that does not\nengage in frequent or significant trading. Preferred Stock Risk . Generally, preferred stock holders have no\nor limited voting rights with respect to the issuing company. In addition, preferred stock is generally\nsenior to common stock, but subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital\nstructure and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments. In the event an\nissuer of preferred stock experiences economic difficulties, the issuer's preferred stock may lose\nsubstantial value due to the increased likelihood of deferred dividend payments and the fact that the\npreferred stock may be subordinated to other securities of the same issuer. Further, because many preferred\nstocks pay dividends at a fixed rate, their market price can be sensitive to changes in interest rates in a\nmanner similar to bonds - that is, as interest rates rise, the value of the preferred stock held by a Fund\nis likely to decline. Therefore, to the extent that a Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in\nfixed rate preferred stock, rising interest rates may cause the value of a Fund's investments to decline\nsignificantly. In addition, to the extent preferred stocks allow holders to convert the preferred stock into\ncommon stock of the issuer, their market price can be sensitive to changes in the value of the issuer's\ncommon stock and, therefore, declining common stock values may also cause the value of a Fund's investments\nto decline. Preferred stock often have call features which allow the issuer to redeem the security at its\ndiscretion. The redemption of a preferred stock having a higher than average yield may cause a decrease in a\nFund's yield. Private Activity Bonds Risk . Private activity bonds are issued by or on behalf of public\nauthorities to obtain funds to provide privately operated housing facilities, airport, mass transit or port\nfacilities, sewage disposal, solid waste disposal or hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities and\ncertain local facilities for water supply, gas or electricity. Other types of private activity bonds, the\nproceeds of which are used for the construction, equipment, repair or improvement of privately operated\nindustrial or commercial facilities, may constitute municipal securities, although the current federal tax\nlaws place limitations on the size of such issues. The credit and quality of private activity bonds are\nusually related to the credit of the corporate user of the facilities. Payment of interest on and repayment\nof principal of such bonds are the responsibility of the corporate user (and/or any guarantor), which means\nthat the holder of the private activity bond is exposed to the risk that the corporate user (and/or any\nguarantor) may default on the private activity bond. Conditions such as regulatory and environmental\nrestrictions and economic downturns may lower the need for and the ability of corporate users to pay for the\nprojects financed by private activity bonds. The Fund's distributions of its interest income from private\nactivity bonds may subject certain investors to federal alternative minimum tax applicable to noncorporate\ntaxpayers. Reinvestment Risk. Income from a Fund's portfolio may decline when the Fund invests the proceeds\nfrom investment income, sales of portfolio securities or matured, traded or called debt obligations. For\ninstance, during periods of declining interest rates, an issuer of debt obligations may exercise an option\nto redeem securities prior to maturity, forcing a Fund to reinvest the proceeds in lower-yielding\nsecurities. A decline in income received by a Fund from its investments is likely to have a negative effect\non the yield and total return of the Fund Shares. Restricted Securities Risk . A Fund may hold securities\nthat have not been registered for sale to the public under the U.S. federal securities laws pursuant to an\nexemption from registration. These securities may be less liquid than securities registered for sale to the\ngeneral public. The liquidity of a restricted security may be affected by a number of factors, including,\namong others: (i) the creditworthiness of the issuer; (ii) the frequency of trades and quotes for the\nsecurity; (iii) the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other\npotential purchasers; (iv) dealer undertakings to make a market in the security; (v) the nature of any legal\nrestrictions governing trading in the security; and (vi) the nature of the security and the nature of\nmarketplace trades. There can be no assurance that a liquid trading market will exist at any time for any\nparticular restricted security. Also, restricted securities may be difficult to value because market\nquotations may not be readily available, and the securities may have significant volatility. Securities\nLending Risk. Each Fund may lend portfolio securities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net\nassets. For these purposes, net assets shall exclude the value of all assets received as collateral for the\nloan. Such loans may be terminated at any time. Any such loans must be continuously secured by collateral\nmaintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned by a\nFund, marked to market each trading day. A Fund will receive the amount of all dividends, interest and other\ndistributions on the loaned 155 securities; however, the borrower has the right to vote the loaned\nsecurities. A Fund will call loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the investment is to be\nvoted upon. Efforts to recall such securities promptly may be unsuccessful, especially for foreign\nsecurities or thinly traded securities. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all.\nShould the borrower of the securities fail financially, a Fund may experience delays in recovering the\nsecurities or exercising its rights in the collateral. Loans are made only to borrowers that are deemed by\nthe securities lending agent to be of good financial standing. In a loan transaction, a Fund will also bear\nthe risk of any decline in value of securities provided as collateral or acquired with cash collateral. Each\nFund will attempt to minimize this risk by limiting the investment of cash collateral to high quality\ninstruments of short maturity either directly on behalf of the lending Fund or through one or more joint\naccounts or funds, which may include those managed by the Adviser. To the extent the collateral provided or\ninvestments made with cash collateral differ from securities included in an Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss than the securities included in the Index. In addition, a Fund\nwill be subject to the risk that any income generated by lending its securities or reinvesting cash\ncollateral is lower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when overseeing a Fund's securities\nlending activity. Settlement Risk . Markets in different countries have different clearance and settlement\nprocedures and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of transactions. Delays in settlement may increase credit risk to a Fund, limit the ability of a\nFund to reinvest the proceeds of a sale of securities, hinder the ability of a Fund to lend its portfolio\nsecurities, and potentially subject a Fund to penalties for its failure to deliver to on-purchasers of\nsecurities whose delivery to a Fund was delayed. Delays in the settlement of securities purchased by a Fund\nmay limit the ability of a Fund to sell those securities at times and prices it considers desirable, and may\nsubject a Fund to losses and costs due to its own inability to settle with subsequent purchasers of the\nsecurities from it. A Fund may be required to borrow monies it had otherwise expected to receive in\nconnection with the settlement of securities sold by it, in order to meet its obligations to others. Limits\non the ability of a Fund to purchase or sell securities due to settlement delays could increase any variance\nbetween a Fund's performance and that of its benchmark index. Sovereign Debt Obligations Risk . Investments\nin debt securities issued by governments or by government agencies and instrumentalities involve the risk\nthat the governmental entities responsible for repayment may be unable or unwilling to pay interest and\nrepay principal when due. A governmental entity's willingness or ability to pay interest and repay principal\nin a timely manner may be affected by a variety of factors, including its cash flow, the size of its\nreserves, its access to foreign exchange, the relative size of its debt service burden to its economy as a\nwhole, and political constraints. A governmental entity may default on its obligations or may require\nrenegotiation or reschedule of debt payments. Any restructuring of a sovereign debt obligation held by a\nFund will likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of the obligation. In the event of default\nof sovereign debt, the Fund may be unable to pursue legal action against the sovereign issuer or to realize\non collateral securing the debt. The sovereign debt of certain non-U.S. governments, including their sub-\ndivisions and instrumentalities, is rated below investment-grade. Sovereign debt risk may be greater for\ndebt securities issued or guaranteed by emerging and/or frontier countries. Subordinated Debt Risk . A Fund\nmay invest in debt securities that are subordinated to more senior securities of the issuer. Holders of debt\nsecurities that are subordinated or \u201cjunior\u201d to more senior securities are entitled to payment after holders\nof more senior securities. Subordinated debt securities are more likely to suffer a credit loss than non-\nsubordinated securities of the same issuer, may be disproportionately affected by a default, downgrade or\nperceived decline in creditworthiness, and may take longer to recover interest or principal. If there is a\ndefault, bankruptcy or liquidation of the issuer, most subordinated debt securities are paid only if\nsufficient assets remain after payment of the issuer's non-subordinated securities. Tax Exemption Risk.\nThere is no guarantee that any of a Fund's income will be exempt from federal or state income taxes. Events\noccurring after the date of issuance of a municipal bond or after a Fund's acquisition of a municipal bond\nmay result in a determination that interest on that bond is includible in gross income for federal income\ntax purposes retroactively to its date of issuance. Such a determination may cause a portion of prior\ndistributions by a Fund to its shareholders that is attributable to municipal bonds to be taxable to those\nshareholders in the year of receipt. Federal or state changes in income or alternative minimum tax rates or\nin the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make municipal bonds less attractive as investments and cause\nthem to decline in value. 156 Technology Sector Risk . Market or economic factors impacting technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on technological advances could have a major effect on the value\nof the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of technology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and competition, both domestically and internationally, including\ncompetition from foreign competitors with lower production costs. Technology companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Stocks of technology companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile\nthan the overall market. Technology companies are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property\nrights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely affect profitability. Additionally, companies in the\ntechnology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the\nservices of qualified personnel. Unconstrained Sector Risk . A Fund may invest a substantial portion of its\nassets within one or more economic sectors or industries, which may change from time to time. When a Fund\nfocuses its investments in a particular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and other\ndevelopments affecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may\nincrease the volatility of the Fund. U.S. Government Securities Risk . U.S. government securities, such as\nTreasury bills, notes and bonds and mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National\nMortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d), are supported by the full faith and credit of the United States; others\nare supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury; others are supported by the\ndiscretionary authority of the U.S. government to purchase the agency's obligations; and still others are\nsupported only by the credit of the issuing agency, instrumentality, or enterprise. Although U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) and the\nFederal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) may be chartered or sponsored by Congress, they are not\nfunded by Congressional appropriations, and their securities are not issued by the U.S. Treasury nor\nsupported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. There is no assurance that the U.S.\ngovernment would provide financial support to its agencies and instrumentalities if not required to do so.\nIn addition, certain governmental entities have been subject to regulatory scrutiny regarding their\naccounting policies and practices and other concerns that may result in legislation, changes in regulatory\noversight and/or other consequences that could adversely affect the credit quality, availability, or\ninvestment character of securities issued by these entities. The value and liquidity of U.S. government\nsecurities may be affected adversely by changes in the ratings of those securities. Securities issued by the\nU.S. Treasury historically have been considered to present minimal credit risk. The downgrade in the long-\nterm U.S. credit rating by at least two major rating agencies has introduced greater uncertainty about the\nability of the U.S. to repay its obligations. Further credit rating downgrades or a U.S. credit default\ncould decrease the value and increase the volatility of a Fund's investments. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk\n. U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of\nissuance and other characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit\nrating of the U.S. government may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. The\ntotal public debt of the United States as a percentage of gross domestic product grew rapidly after the\nfinancial crisis of 2008 and has remained at a historically high level. Although high debt levels do not\nnecessarily indicate or cause economic problems, they may create certain systemic risks if sound debt\nmanagement practices are not implemented. A high national debt level may increase market pressures to meet\ngovernment funding needs, which may drive debt cost higher and cause a country to sell additional debt,\nthereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national debt also raises concerns that a government will not be\nable to make principal or interest payments when they are due. In the worst case, unsustainable debt levels\ncan cause a decline in the value of the dollar (which may lead to inflation), and can prevent the U.S.\ngovernment from implementing effective countercyclical fiscal policy in economic downturns. On August 5,\n2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services downgraded U.S. Treasury securities from AAA rating to AA+ rating.\nStandard & Poor's Ratings Services stated that its decision was prompted by its view on the rising public\ndebt burden and its perception of greater policymaking uncertainty. Fitch also downgraded its rating of U.S.\nTreasury securities from AAA to AA+ in August 2023, citing increasing government debt and erosion in\nconfidence regarding governance of fiscal matters as a result of repeated political standoffs related to\ndebt limit approvals. A downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used\nas a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and\ncorporate borrowers, cause disruptions in the international bond markets and have a substantial negative\neffect on the U.S. economy. Any additional downgrades of 157 U.S. Treasury securities from ratings agencies\nmay cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. In recent years, impasses in Congress\nregarding the federal budget have caused temporary Federal government shutdowns. While Congress has\ntemporarily suspended the debt limit from time to time, the risks that the U.S. government will not adopt a\nlong-term budget or deficit reduction plan, of one or more additional Federal government shutdowns or of\nfuture failures to not increase the Federal government's debt limit, may affect investor and consumer\nconfidence and may adversely impact financial markets and the broader economy, perhaps suddenly and to a\nsignificant degree. Valuation Risk . Certain portfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors other\nthan market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market quotations are not readily\navailable. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ from what would\nbe produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations\nwere used. Technological issues or other service disruption issues involving third-party service providers\nmay cause a Fund to value its investments incorrectly. In addition, there is no assurance that a Fund could\nsell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that\na Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation\nestablished by a Fund at that time. Variable and Floating Rate Securities Risk . Variable or floating rate\nsecurities are debt securities with variable or floating interest rates payments. Variable or floating rate\nsecurities bear rates of interest that are adjusted periodically according to formulae intended generally to\nreflect market rates of interest and allow a Fund to participate (determined in accordance with the terms of\nthe securities) in increases in interest rates through upward adjustments of the coupon rates on the\nsecurities. However, during periods of increasing interest rates, changes in the coupon rates may lag behind\nthe changes in market rates or may have limits on the maximum increases in coupon rates. Alternatively,\nduring periods of declining interest rates, the coupon rates on such securities will typically readjust\ndownward resulting in a lower yield. A Fund may also invest in variable or floating rate equity securities,\nwhose dividend payments vary based on changes in market rates of interest or other factors. In addition,\ninvestment in derivative variable rate securities, such as inverse floaters, whose rates vary inversely with\nmarket rates of interest, or range floaters or capped floaters, whose rates are subject to periodic or\nlifetime caps, or in securities that pay a rate of interest determined by applying a multiple to the\nvariable rate involves special risks as compared to investment in a fixed-rate security and may involve\nleverage. The extent of increases and decreases in the values of derivative variable rate securities and the\ncorresponding change to the net asset value of the Fund in response to changes in market rates of interest\ngenerally may be larger than comparable changes in the value of an equal principal amount of a fixed-rate\nsecurity having similar credit quality, redemption provisions, and maturity. The markets for such securities\nmay be less developed and may have less liquidity than the markets for conventional securities. When-Issued,\nTBA and Delayed Delivery Securities Risk. A Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued, TBA or delayed\ndelivery basis and may purchase securities on a forward commitment basis. The purchase price of the\nsecurities is typically fixed at the time of the commitment, but delivery and payment can take place a month\nor more after the date of the commitment. The prices of the securities so purchased or sold are subject to\nmarket fluctuations. At the time of delivery of the securities, the value may be more or less than the\npurchase or sale price. Purchase of securities on a when-issued, TBA, delayed delivery, or forward\ncommitment basis may give rise to investment leverage, and may result in increased volatility of a Fund's\nnet asset value. Default by, or bankruptcy of, a counterparty to a when-issued, TBA or delayed delivery\ntransaction would expose a Fund to possible losses because of an adverse market action, expenses or delays\nin connection with the purchase or sale of the pools specified in such transaction. The Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority, Inc. imposes mandatory margin requirements for certain types of when-issued, TBA,\ndelayed delivery and forward commitment transactions, with limited exceptions. Such transactions require\nmandatory collateralization which may increase the cost of such transactions and impose added operational\ncomplexity. 158 Zero-Coupon Bond Risk . Zero-coupon bonds are debt obligations that are generally issued at\na discount and payable in full at maturity, and that do not provide for current payments of interest prior\nto maturity. Zero-coupon bonds usually trade at a deep discount from their face or par values and are\nsubject to greater market value fluctuations from changing interest rates than debt obligations of\ncomparable maturities that make current distributions of interest. When interest rates rise, the values of\nzero-coupon bonds fall more rapidly than securities paying interest on a current basis, because a Fund is\nunable to reinvest interest payments at the higher rates. Non-Principal Risks Each risk discussed below is a\nnon-principal risk of a Fund to the extent it is not identified as a principal risk for such Fund in the\npreceding \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION - PRINCIPAL RISKS\u201d section. Authorized Participants, Market Makers\nand Liquidity Providers Concentration Risk. A Fund has a limited number of financial institutions that may\nact as Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d), which are responsible for the creation and redemption activity for a\nFund. In addition, there may be a limited number of market makers and/or liquidity providers in the\nmarketplace. To the extent either of the following events occur, Fund Shares may trade at a material\ndiscount to NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit the business or otherwise become unable to process\ncreation and/or redemption orders and no other APs step forward to perform these services, or (ii) market\nmakers and/or liquidity providers exit the business or significantly reduce their business activities and no\nother entities step forward to perform their functions. Cash Transaction Risk . To the extent a Fund sells\nportfolio securities to meet some or all of a redemption request with cash, the Fund may incur taxable gains\nor losses that it might not have incurred had it made redemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, a Fund may\npay out higher annual capital gain distributions than if the in-kind redemption process was used.\nConcentration Risk. A Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to\nthe extent that the Fund's underlying Index concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries.\nWhen a Fund focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and\nother developments affecting issuers in that industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect\non the Fund than if it had not focused its assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may\nincrease the volatility of the Fund. Conflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a Fund will be subject to\na number of actual or potential conflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser or its affiliates may\nprovide services to a Fund, such as securities lending agency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities brokerage\nservices, and other services for which the Fund would compensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates. The\nFunds may invest in other pooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates at which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its\naffiliates, or the terms on which it enters into transactions with the Adviser or its affiliates will be the\nmost favorable available in the market generally or as favorable as the rates the Adviser or its affiliates\nmake available to other clients. Because of its financial interest, the Adviser will have an incentive to\nenter into transactions or arrangements on behalf of a Fund with itself or its affiliates in circumstances\nwhere it might not have done so in the absence of that interest, provided that the Adviser will comply with\napplicable regulatory requirements. The Adviser and its affiliates serve as investment adviser to other\nclients and may make investment decisions that may be different from those that will be made by the Adviser\non behalf of the Funds. For example, the Adviser may provide asset allocation advice to some clients that\nmay include a recommendation to invest in or redeem from particular issuers while not providing that same\nrecommendation to all clients invested in the same or similar issuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to purchase (or sell) investments for a Fund and to sell (or\npurchase) the same investment for accounts, funds, or structured products for which it serves as asset\nmanager, or for other clients or affiliates. The Adviser and its affiliates may invest for clients in\nvarious securities that are senior, pari passu or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to,\nthe securities that are owned by a Fund. The Adviser or its affiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material nonpublic confidential information that may restrict the Adviser\nfrom purchasing securities or selling securities for itself or its clients (including the Funds) or\notherwise using such information for the benefit of its clients or itself. 159 The foregoing does not\npurport to be a comprehensive list or complete explanation of all potential conflicts of interests which may\naffect a Fund. A Fund may encounter circumstances, or enter into transactions, in which conflicts of\ninterest that are not listed or discussed above may arise. Costs of Buying and Selling Shares . Investors\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other charges\nimposed by brokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be\na significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of Fund\nShares. In addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the difference between the price\nthat an investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which an investor is\nwilling to sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as\nthe \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time for Fund Shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if Fund Shares have more trading volume and market\nliquidity and higher if Fund Shares have little trading volume and market liquidity. Further, increased\nmarket volatility may cause increased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling Fund Shares,\nincluding bid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Fund Shares may significantly reduce investment results and\nan investment in Fund Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small\ninvestments. Counterparty Risk. A Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties\nwith which the Fund enters into derivatives contracts and other transactions such as repurchase agreements\nor reverse repurchase agreements. A Fund's ability to profit from these types of investments and\ntransactions will depend on the willingness and ability of its counterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate or realize any\ngain on the investment or transaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund. A Fund may experience significant\ndelays in obtaining any recovery in an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding involving\nits counterparty (including recovery of any collateral posted by it) and may obtain only a limited recovery\nor may obtain no recovery in such circumstances. If a Fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or prevented from realizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding relating to the counterparty. Under applicable law or contractual provisions, including if a Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with a financial institution and such financial institution (or an\naffiliate of the financial institution) experiences financial difficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from exercising its rights to terminate the investment or transaction, or\nto realize on any collateral and may result in the suspension of payment and delivery obligations of the\nparties under such investment or transactions or in another institution being substituted for that financial\ninstitution without the consent of the Fund. Further, a Fund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the financial institution's authority, the financial institution's\nliabilities could be written down, eliminated or converted into equity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial institution may result in a reduction in value of some or all of\nsecurities and, if a Fund holds such securities or has entered into a transaction with such a financial\nsecurity when a bail-in occurs, such Fund may also be similarly impacted. Cybersecurity Risk . With the\nincreased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform\nbusiness and operational functions, funds (such as the Funds) and their service providers (including the\nAdviser) may be prone to operational and information security risks resulting from cyber-attacks and/or\ntechnological malfunctions. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate cybersecurity attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing. In general, cyber-attacks are deliberate, but unintentional events may have\nsimilar effects. Cyber-attacks include, among others, stealing or corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing information or services on a website, releasing\nconfidential information without authorization, and causing operational disruption. Successful cyber-attacks\nagainst, or security breakdowns of, a Fund, the Adviser, a sub-adviser or a custodian, transfer agent, or\nother affiliated or third-party service provider may adversely affect a Fund or its shareholders. For\ninstance, cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may interfere with the processing of shareholder or other\ntransactions, affect a Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the release of private shareholder\ninformation or confidential Fund information, impede trading, cause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial losses, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and\nadditional compliance costs. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may render records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and other data integral to the functioning of a Fund\ninaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. A Fund may also incur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund and 160 its shareholders could be\nnegatively impacted as a result. While the Adviser and/or the Sub-Adviser have established business\ncontinuity plans and systems designed to minimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the use of technology,\nprocesses and controls, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility\nthat certain risks have not been identified, given the evolving nature of this threat. Each Fund relies on\nthird-party service providers for many of its day-to-day operations, and will be subject to the risk that\nthe protections and protocols implemented by those service providers will be ineffective to protect the Fund\nfrom cyber-attack. The Adviser does not control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by third-\nparty service providers, and such third-party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations\nto the Adviser or the Funds. Similar types of cybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions also are present\nfor issuers of securities in which each Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences\nfor such issuers, and may cause a Fund's investment in such securities to lose value. Derivatives Risk. A\nderivative is a financial contract the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an\nunderlying asset, interest rate, or index. Derivative transactions typically involve leverage and may have\nsignificant volatility. It is possible that a derivative transaction will result in a loss greater than the\nprincipal amount invested, and a Fund may not be able to close out a derivative transaction at a favorable\ntime or price. Risks associated with derivative instruments include potential changes in value in response\nto interest rate changes or other market developments or as a result of the counterparty's credit quality;\nthe potential for the derivative transaction not to have the effect the Adviser anticipated or a different\nor less favorable effect than the Adviser anticipated; the failure of the counterparty to the derivative\ntransaction to perform its obligations under the transaction or to settle a trade; possible mispricing or\nimproper valuation of the derivative instrument; imperfect correlation in the value of a derivative with the\nasset, rate, or index underlying the derivative; the risk that a Fund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be able to recover the collateral or margin in the event of the\ncounterparty's insolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will experience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio investments, even when the derivatives investments may be intended in\npart or entirely to hedge those portfolio investments; the risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for the derivative instrument, including without limitation absence\nof a secondary trading market; the potential for reduced returns to a Fund due to losses on the transaction\nand an increase in volatility; the potential for the derivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and legal risks arising from the documentation relating to the\nderivative transaction. Index Construction Risk . A security included in an Index may not exhibit the\ncharacteristic or provide the specific exposure for which it was selected and consequently a Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that characteristic or exposure. Index Licensing Risk . It is\npossible that the license under which the Adviser or a Fund is permitted to replicate or otherwise use an\nIndex will be terminated or may be disputed, impaired or cease to remain in effect. In such a case, the\nAdviser may be required to replace the relevant Index with another index which it considers to be\nappropriate in light of the investment strategy of a Fund. The use of any such substitute index may have an\nadverse impact on a Fund's performance. In the event that the Adviser is unable to identify a suitable\nreplacement for the relevant Index, it may determine to terminate a Fund. Leveraging Risk . Borrowing\ntransactions, reverse repurchase agreements, certain derivatives transactions, securities lending\ntransactions and other investment transactions such as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward commitment\ntransactions may create investment leverage. If a Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect\non the Fund's investment portfolio, the value of the Fund will be potentially more volatile and all other\nrisks will tend to be compounded. This is because leverage generally creates investment risk with respect to\na larger base of assets than a Fund would otherwise have and so magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying assets. The use of leverage is considered to be a speculative\ninvestment practice and may result in losses to a Fund. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial investment. The use of leverage may cause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy repayment, interest payment, or margin\nobligations or to meet asset coverage requirements. Money Market Fund Investment Risk . An investment in a\nmoney market fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other\ngovernment agency. Certain money market funds seek to preserve the value of their shares at $1.00 per share,\nalthough there can be no assurance that they will do so, and it is possible to lose money by investing in\nsuch a money market fund. A major or unexpected change in interest rates or a decline in the credit quality\nof an issuer or entity providing credit support, an inactive trading market for money market 161\ninstruments, or adverse market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other\nconditions could cause the share price of such a money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is possible that\nsuch a money market fund will issue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at times when the fair value of the\nmoney market fund's portfolio per share is more or less than $1.00. None of the State Street Entities\nguarantee the value of an investment in a money market fund at $1.00 per share. Investors should have no\nexpectation of capital support to a money market fund from State Street Entities. Other money market funds\nprice and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV that will fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of\nfund assets. Shares sold utilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or less than their original purchase\nprice. Recent changes in the regulation of money market funds may affect the operations and structures of\nmoney market funds. A money market fund may be permitted or required to impose redemption fees during times\nof market stress. Portfolio Turnover Risk . A Fund may engage in frequent trading of its portfolio\nsecurities. Fund turnover generally involves a number of direct and indirect costs and expenses to a Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and transaction costs\non the sale of securities and reinvestment in other securities. The costs related to increased portfolio\nturnover have the effect of reducing a Fund's investment return, and the sale of securities by the Fund may\nresult in the realization of taxable capital gains, including short-term capital gains. A Fund may engage in\nsignificant trading of its portfolio securities in connection with Index rebalancing. Frequent or\nsignificant trading may cause a Fund to incur additional transaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does not engage in frequent or significant trading. Regulatory\nRisk. Governmental and regulatory actions may have unexpected or adverse consequences on particular markets,\nstrategies, or investments, which may adversely impact a Fund and impair how it is managed. Policy and\nlegislative changes in the United States and in other countries may affect aspects of financial regulation,\nand may in some instances contribute to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the financial\nmarkets. The impact of these changes on the markets, and the practical implications for market participants,\nmay not be fully known for some time. Securities Lending Risk. Each Fund may lend portfolio securities in an\namount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For these purposes, net assets shall exclude the\nvalue of all assets received as collateral for the loan. Such loans may be terminated at any time. Any such\nloans must be continuously secured by collateral maintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal\nto the market value of the securities loaned by a Fund, marked to market each trading day. A Fund will\nreceive the amount of all dividends, interest and other distributions on the loaned securities; however, the\nborrower has the right to vote the loaned securities. A Fund will call loans to vote proxies if a material\nissue affecting the investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to recall such securities promptly may be\nunsuccessful, especially for foreign securities or thinly traded securities. Securities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. Should the borrower of the securities fail financially, a Fund may\nexperience delays in recovering the securities or exercising its rights in the collateral. Loans are made\nonly to borrowers that are deemed by the securities lending agent to be of good financial standing. In a\nloan transaction, a Fund will also bear the risk of any decline in value of securities provided as\ncollateral or acquired with cash collateral. Each Fund will attempt to minimize this risk by limiting the\ninvestment of cash collateral to high quality instruments of short maturity either directly on behalf of the\nlending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or funds, which may include those managed by the Adviser.\nTo the extent the collateral provided or investments made with cash collateral differ from securities\nincluded in an Index, such collateral or investments may have a greater risk of loss than the securities\nincluded in the Index. In addition, a Fund will be subject to the risk that any income generated by lending\nits securities or reinvesting cash collateral is lower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower.\nThe Adviser will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when\noverseeing a Fund's securities lending activity. Trading Issues . Although Fund Shares are listed for\ntrading on the Exchange and may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the\nExchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such Fund Shares will develop or be\nmaintained. Trading in Fund Shares on the Exchange may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons\nthat, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in Fund Shares inadvisable. In addition, trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to\nExchange \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of operating companies listed on a stock exchange,\nFund Shares may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility in the trading\nprice of the Fund's shares. While each Fund expects that the ability of Authorized Participants to create\nand redeem Fund Shares at net 162 asset value should be effective in reducing any such volatility, there is\nno guarantee that it will eliminate the volatility associated with such short sales. There can be no\nassurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of a Fund will continue to\nbe met or will remain unchanged or that Fund Shares will trade with any volume, or at all, on any stock\nexchange. 163\n\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an\ninvestment advisory agreement (\u201cInvestment Advisory Agreement\u201d) between the Trust and the Adviser, and,\nsubject to the oversight of the Board, is responsible for the investment management of each Fund. The\nAdviser provides an investment management program for each Fund and manages the investment of each Fund's\nassets. In addition, the Adviser provides administrative, compliance and general management services to each\nFund. The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc., which itself is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Corporation. The Adviser is registered with the SEC under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Adviser and certain other affiliates of State Street\nCorporation make up SSGA. SSGA is one of the world's largest institutional money managers and the investment\nmanagement arm of State Street Corporation.

The contractual fee waiver does not provide for the\nrecoupment by the Adviser of any fees the Adviser previously waived. The Adviser may continue the waiver\nand/or reimbursement from year to year, but there is no guarantee that the Adviser will do so and the waiver\nand/or reimbursement may be cancelled or modified at any time after October 31, 2025. This waiver and/or\nreimbursement may not be terminated prior to October 31, 2025 except with the approval of the Fund's Board\nof Trustees. (2) Effective August 1, 2023, the Adviser agreed to reduce the Fund's management fee from 0.10%\nto 0.05% of the Fund's average daily net assets. (3) Effective August 1, 2023, the Adviser agreed to reduce\nthe Fund's management fee from 0.06% to 0.03% of the Fund's average daily net assets. From time to time, the\nAdviser may waive all or a portion of its management fee. The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount equal to any acquired fund fees and\nexpenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash management purposes, if any) for each Fund until\n\n164\n\nOctober 31, 2025. This waiver and/or reimbursement does not provide for the recoupment by the Adviser of any\namounts waived or reimbursed. This waiver and/or reimbursement may not be terminated prior to October 31,\n2025 except with the approval of the Board. The Adviser pays all expenses of each Fund other than the\nmanagement fee, brokerage expenses, taxes, interest, fees and expenses of the Independent Trustees\n(including any Trustee's counsel fees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees and expenses and other\nextraordinary expenses. Investment Sub-Advisers . Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement between the Funds and\nthe Adviser, the Adviser is authorized to engage one or more sub-advisers for the performance of any of the\nservices contemplated to be rendered by the Adviser. The Adviser has retained Nuveen Asset Management, LLC\n(\u201cNuveen Asset Management\u201d) as sub-adviser, to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Municipal\nBond ETFs' investments, subject to supervision by the Adviser and the Board. The Adviser provides\nadministrative, compliance and general management services to the Municipal Bond ETFs. Nuveen Asset\nManagement is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nNuveen LLC (\u201cNuveen\u201d).

The Municipal Bond ETFs are not\nresponsible for the fees paid to Nuveen Asset Management. Participating Affiliates . The Adviser has entered\ninto personnel-sharing arrangements with each of SSGA LTD and SSGA Singapore, each an affiliate of the\nAdviser. SSGA LTD is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc. (\u201cSSGA,\nInc.\u201d) and SSGA Singapore is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of SSGA, Inc. SSGA, Inc. is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Corporation. Pursuant to the personnel-sharing arrangements, certain employees of\nSSGA LTD and SSGA Singapore, as \u201cparticipating affiliates,\u201d serve as \u201cassociated persons\u201d of the Adviser,\nand, in this capacity, are subject to the oversight of the Adviser and its Chief Compliance Officer. These\nassociated persons may, on behalf of the Adviser, provide discretionary investment management services\n(including portfolio management and trading services), research and related services to the SPDR Bloomberg\nEmerging Markets USD Bond ETF in accordance with the investment objectives, policies and limitations set\nforth in the prospectus and SAI. Unlike the Adviser, neither SSGA LTD nor SSGA Singapore is registered as an\ninvestment adviser with the SEC.

Additional Purchase\nand Sale Information Fund Shares are listed for secondary trading on the Exchange and individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. The secondary markets are\nclosed on weekends and also are generally closed on the following holidays: New Year's Day, Dr. Martin\nLuther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day (observed), Juneteenth National\nIndependence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Exchange may close\nearly on the business day before certain holidays and on the day after Thanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday\nschedules are subject to change without notice. If you buy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary market, you\nwill pay the secondary market price for Fund Shares. In addition, you may incur customary brokerage\ncommissions and charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the bid and the offered price in the\nsecondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction. The trading prices of Fund\nShares will fluctuate continuously throughout trading hours based on market supply and demand rather than\nthe relevant Fund's net asset value, which is calculated for each Fund other than the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3\nMonth T-Bill ETF once daily as of the close of the regular trading session on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange is open. With respect to the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill\nETF, the Fund's net asset value is calculated twice daily on each day the NYSE is open at the following\ntimes: (i) 12:00 p.m. Eastern time; and (ii) at the close of the regular trading session on the NYSE. Fund\nShares will trade on the Exchange at prices that may be above ( i.e ., at a premium) or below ( i.e ., at a\ndiscount), to varying degrees, the calculated net asset value of Fund Shares. The trading prices of Fund\nShares may deviate significantly from the relevant Fund's net asset value during periods of market\nvolatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares can be issued and redeemed daily in Creation Units, the Adviser\nbelieves that large discounts and premiums to net asset value should not be sustained over long periods. The\nExchange will disseminate, every fifteen seconds during the regular trading day, an indicative optimized\nportfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to each Fund. The IOPV calculations are estimates of the value of each\nFund's net asset value per Fund Share. Premiums and discounts between the IOPV and the market price may\noccur. This should not be viewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is\nbased on the current market value of the published basket of portfolio securities and/or cash required to be\ndeposited in exchange for a Creation Unit and does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of a\nFund's actual portfolio at a particular point in time. Moreover, the IOPV is generally determined by using\ncurrent market quotations and/or price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market\nintermediaries and valuations based on current market rates. The IOPV may not be calculated in the same\nmanner as the NAV, which (i) is computed only once a day, (ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be subject, in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act,\nto fair valuation at different prices than those used in the calculations of the IOPV. The IOPV price is\nbased on quotes and closing prices from the securities' local market converted into U.S. dollars at the\ncurrent currency rates and may not reflect events that occur subsequent to the local market's close.\nTherefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best possible valuation of a Fund's current portfolio. Neither the\nFunds nor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or\ndissemination of such IOPVs and make no warranty as to their accuracy. The Funds do not impose any\nrestrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions; however, the Funds reserve the right to reject\nor limit purchases at any time as described in the SAI. When considering that no restriction or policy was\nnecessary, the Board evaluated the risks posed by market timing activities, such as whether frequent\npurchases and redemptions would interfere with the efficient implementation of a Fund's investment strategy,\nor whether they would cause a Fund to experience increased transaction costs. The Board considered that,\nunlike traditional mutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and redeemed only in large quantities of shares\nknown as Creation Units, available only from a Fund directly, and that most trading in a Fund occurs on the\nExchange at prevailing market prices and does not involve the Fund directly. Given this structure, the Board\ndetermined that it is unlikely that (a) market timing would be attempted by a Fund's shareholders or (b) any\nattempts to market time a Fund by shareholders would result in negative impact to the Fund or its\nshareholders. 173 Distributions Dividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are entitled to your\nshare of the applicable Fund's income and net realized gains on its investments. Each Fund pays out\nsubstantially all of its net earnings to its shareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d Each Fund may earn interest\nfrom debt securities and, if participating, securities lending income. In addition, the SPDR Bloomberg\nConvertible Securities ETF may earn dividend income from preferred securities. These amounts, net of\nexpenses and taxes (if applicable), are passed along to Fund shareholders as \u201cincome dividend\ndistributions.\u201d Each Fund will generally realize short-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or\nexchanges assets held for one year or less. Net short-term capital gains will generally be treated as\nordinary income when distributed to shareholders. Each Fund will generally realize long-term capital gains\nor losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets held for more than one year. Net capital gains (the excess\nof a Fund's net long-term capital gains over its net short-term capital losses) are distributed to\nshareholders as \u201ccapital gain distributions.\u201d Income dividend distributions, if any, are generally\ndistributed to shareholders monthly, but may vary significantly from period to period. Net capital gains for\neach Fund are distributed at least annually. Dividends may be declared and paid more frequently or at any\nother time to improve Index tracking or to comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). A portion of each distribution may result in a return of capital. You\nwill be notified regarding the portion of the distribution which represents a return of capital.\nDistributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole Fund Shares only if the broker\nthrough whom you purchased Fund Shares makes such option available. Distributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as if such distributions had not been reinvested. Portfolio\nHoldings Disclosure The Funds' portfolio holdings disclosure policy is described in the SAI. In addition,\nthe identities and quantities of the securities held by each Fund are disclosed on the Funds' website.\nAdditional Tax Information The following discussion is a summary of some important U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an investment in a Fund. Your investment in a Fund may have other tax\nimplications. Please consult your tax advisor about federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws\napplicable to you. Investors, including non-U.S. investors, may wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Each Fund has elected or will elect to be a regulated investment company and intends\nto qualify each year to be treated as such. A regulated investment company is generally not subject to tax\nat the corporate level on income and gains that are distributed to shareholders. However, a Fund's failure\nto qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company may result in corporate level taxation, and\nconsequently, a reduction in income available for distribution to shareholders. Taxes On Distributions\n(Municipal Bond ETFs only). Dividends paid by a Municipal Bond ETF that are reported as exempt-interest\ndividends will not be subject to regular federal income tax. Each Municipal Bond ETF intends to invest its\nassets in a manner such that dividend distributions to its shareholders will generally be exempt from\nregular U.S. federal income tax. Dividends paid by a Municipal Bond ETF will be exempt from regular federal\nincome tax to the extent of such Fund's net tax-exempt interest income as long as 50% or more of the value\nof such Fund's assets at the end of each quarter is invested in state, municipal and other bonds the\ninterest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and each Municipal Bond ETF\nreports such dividends as exempt-interest dividends. Because a Municipal Bond ETF may invest in \u201cprivate\nactivity bonds\u201d (within the meaning of Section 141 of the Code), the interest on which is not exempt from\nU.S. federal income tax for persons who are \u201csubstantial users\u201d of the facilities financed by such bonds or\n\u201crelated persons\u201d of such \u201csubstantial users,\u201d the Municipal Bond ETFs may not be an appropriate investment\nfor shareholders who are considered either a \u201csubstantial user\u201d or \u201crelated person\u201d within the meaning of\nthe Code. In addition, interest on certain municipal securities that meet the definition of private activity\n174 bonds under the Code is included as an item of tax preference in determining the amount of a\nnoncorporate taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income. To the extent a Municipal Bond ETF receives\nincome from private activity bonds, a portion of the dividends paid by it, although otherwise exempt from\nfederal income tax, may be taxable to those noncorporate shareholders subject to the alternative minimum tax\nregime. Each Municipal Bond ETF will annually supply shareholders with a report indicating the percentage of\nits income attributable to private activity bonds and therefore required to be included in calculating the\nfederal alternative minimum tax applicable to noncorporate taxpayers. Exempt-interest dividends from a\nMunicipal Bond ETF are taken into account in determining the taxable portion of any Social Security or\nrailroad retirement benefits that you receive. If you receive Social Security or railroad retirement\nbenefits, you should consult your tax advisor about how an investment in a Municipal Bond ETF may affect the\ntaxation of your benefits. Exempt-interest dividends attributable to interest on municipal securities issued\nby a state or its political subdivisions may be exempt in the hands of a shareholder from income tax imposed\nby that state, but exempt-interest dividends attributable to interest on municipal securities issued by\nanother state generally will not be exempt from such income tax. All Funds. In general, your distributions\n(other than exempt-interest dividends) are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you\ntake them in cash or reinvest them in a Fund. The income dividends (other than exempt-interest dividends)\nand short-term capital gains distributions you receive from the Funds will generally be taxed as ordinary\nincome. Subject to certain limitations, dividends that are reported by a Fund as qualified dividend income\nare taxable to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Any distributions of a Fund's net capital gains\nare taxable as long-term capital gain regardless of how long you have owned Fund Shares. Long-term capital\ngains are generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Although the Municipal Bond ETFs do\nnot seek to realize taxable income or capital gains, they may realize and distribute taxable income or\ncapital gains from time to time as a result of their normal investment activities. Distributions in excess\nof a Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the\nextent of your basis in the applicable Fund's shares, and, in general, as capital gain thereafter. In\ngeneral, dividends may be reported by a Fund as qualified dividend income if they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income received by the Fund, which, in general, includes dividend income from taxable\nU.S. corporations and certain foreign corporations ( i.e. , certain foreign corporations incorporated in a\npossession of the United States or in certain countries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the United\nStates, and certain other foreign corporations if the stock with respect to which the dividend is paid is\nreadily tradable on an established securities market in the United States), provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its\nposition in the stock in certain ways. A dividend generally will not be treated as qualified dividend income\nif the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held by a Fund for fewer than 61 days during\nthe 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-\ndividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain preferred stock, for fewer than 91 days\nduring the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date. These holding period requirements will also\napply to your ownership of Fund Shares. Holding periods may be suspended for these purposes for stock that\nis hedged. SPDR Bloomberg Convertible Securities ETF may hold common stock or preferred securities. Thus,\nSPDR Bloomberg Convertible Securities ETF may report a portion of its distributions as qualified dividend\nincome. Since the other Funds primarily hold investments that do not pay dividends, it is not expected that\na substantial portion of the dividends paid by those other Funds will qualify for either the dividends-\nreceived deduction for corporations or the favorable income tax rates available to individuals on qualified\ndividend income. Additionally, income derived in connection with a Fund's securities lending activities will\nnot be treated as qualified dividend income. U.S. individuals with income exceeding specified thresholds are\nsubject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on all or a portion of their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which\nincludes taxable interest, dividends and certain capital gains (generally including capital gain\ndistributions and capital gains realized upon the sale of Fund Shares) but does not include exempt-interest\ndividends paid by Municipal Bond ETFs. This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of the undistributed\nnet investment income of certain shareholders that are estates and trusts. 175 Certain tax-exempt\neducational institutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on net investment income. For these purposes, certain\ndividends and capital gain distributions (but not exempt-interest dividends paid by Municipal Bond ETFs),\nand certain gains from the disposition of Fund Shares (among other categories of income), are generally\ntaken into account in computing a shareholder's net investment income. If you lend your Fund Shares pursuant\nto securities lending arrangements you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends (paid while the Fund\nShares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividend income. You should consult your financial\nintermediary or tax advisor to discuss your particular circumstances. Distributions paid in January, but\ndeclared by a Fund in October, November or December of the previous year, payable to shareholders of record\nin such a month, may be taxable to you in the calendar year in which they were declared. The Funds will\ninform you of the amount of your ordinary income dividends, capital gain distributions and any qualified\ndividend income shortly after the close of each calendar year. A distribution will reduce a Fund's net asset\nvalue per Fund Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an\ninvestment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. Original Issue Discount .\nInvestments by a Fund in zero coupon or other discount securities will result in income to the Fund equal to\na portion of the excess face value of the securities over their issue price (the \u201coriginal issue discount\u201d\nor \u201cOID\u201d) each year that the securities are held, even though the Fund may receive no cash interest payments\nor may receive cash interest payments that are less than the income recognized for tax purposes. In other\ncircumstances, whether pursuant to the terms of a security or as a result of other factors outside the\ncontrol of a Fund, a Fund may recognize income without receiving a commensurate amount of cash. A Fund's\nshare of such income is included in determining the amount that the Fund must distribute to maintain its\neligibility for treatment as a regulated investment company and to avoid the payment of federal tax,\nincluding the nondeductible 4% excise tax. Because any income required to be recognized as a result of the\nOID and/or market discount rules (discussed below) may not be matched by a corresponding cash payment, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to be able to make distributions to its\nshareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company and eliminate taxes at the\nFund level. Inflation-Indexed Bonds. Special rules apply if a Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds. Generally,\nall stated interest on inflation-indexed bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method of\naccounting for interest income. The amount of any positive inflation adjustment for a taxable year, which\nresults from an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. The\namount of a Fund's OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will increase the Fund's taxable income for\nsuch year without a corresponding receipt of cash until the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need to\nuse other sources of cash to satisfy its distribution requirements for such year. The amount of any negative\ninflation adjustments, which result from a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond,\nfirst reduces the amount of interest (including stated interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise\nincludible in a Fund's income with respect to the bond for the taxable year; any remaining negative\nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary loss or, in certain circumstances, carried forward to reduce\nthe amount of interest income taken into account with respect to the bond in future taxable years. Market\nDiscount (For Securities Other Than Municipal Securities). Any market discount recognized on a market\ndiscount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary\nmarket at a price below redemption value or below adjusted issue price if the bond was issued with original\nissue discount. Absent an election by a Fund to include the market discount in income as it accrues, the\ngain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital\ngain to the extent of the accrued market discount. Where the income required to be recognized as a result of\nthe market discount rules is not matched by a corresponding cash receipt by the Fund, the Fund may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of securities to enable the Fund to make distributions to its\nshareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company and eliminate taxes at the\nFund level, potentially resulting in additional taxable gain or loss to the Fund. Market Discount (Municipal\nSecurities). If a Municipal Bond ETF purchases a municipal security at a market discount, any gain realized\nby a Municipal Bond ETF upon sale or redemption of the municipal security will be treated as taxable\ninterest income to the extent of the market discount, and any gain realized in excess of the market discount\nwill be treated as capital gains. 176 Derivatives and Other Complex Securities. A Fund may invest in complex\nsecurities. These investments may be subject to numerous special and complex rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund are treated as ordinary income or capital gain, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to a Fund and/or defer a Fund's ability to recognize losses. In turn, these rules may\naffect the amount, timing or character of the income distributed to you by a Fund. You should consult your\npersonal tax advisor regarding the application of these rules. Foreign Currency Transactions. A Fund's\ntransactions in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated debt obligations and certain foreign\ncurrency options, futures contracts and forward contracts (and similar instruments) may give rise to\nordinary income or loss to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the\nforeign currency concerned. Foreign Income Taxes. Investment income received by a Fund from sources within\nforeign countries may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. The United States has\nentered into tax treaties with many foreign countries which may entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of such\ntaxes or exemption from taxes on such income. It is impossible to determine the effective rate of foreign\ntax for a Fund in advance since the amount of the assets to be invested within various countries is not\nknown. If more than 50% of the total assets of a Fund at the close of its taxable year consist of certain\nforeign stocks or securities, the Fund may elect to \u201cpass through\u201d to you certain foreign income taxes\n(including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. If a Fund in which you hold Fund Shares makes such an\nelection, you will be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such foreign\ntaxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income,\nor, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your federal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in computing their alternative minimum tax liability. If a Fund does\nnot so elect, the Fund will be entitled to claim a deduction for certain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund.\nUnder certain circumstances, if a Fund receives a refund of foreign taxes paid in respect of a prior year,\nthe value of Fund Shares could be affected or any foreign tax credits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign taxes for the current year could be reduced. Taxes on\nExchange-Listed Share Sales. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund Shares is generally\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been held for more than one year and as short-\nterm capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been held for one year or less, except that any capital loss\non the sale of Fund Shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent\nthat capital gain dividends were paid with respect to such Fund Shares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions\nof Creation Units. A person who exchanges securities for Creation Units generally will recognize a gain or\nloss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the market value of the Creation Units at the\ntime and the exchanger's aggregate basis in the securities surrendered plus any cash paid for the Creation\nUnits. A person who exchanges Creation Units for securities will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the exchanger's basis in the Creation Units and the aggregate market value of the\nsecurities and the amount of cash received. The IRS, however, may assert that a loss realized upon an\nexchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing \u201cwash\nsales,\u201d or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position. Persons exchanging\nsecurities should consult their own tax advisor with respect to whether wash sale rules apply and when a\nloss might be deductible. Under current federal tax laws, any capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the\napplicable Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have been held for more than one year and as a short-term\ncapital gain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have been held for one year\nor less. If you create or redeem Creation Units, you will be sent a confirmation statement showing how many\nFund Shares you purchased or sold and at what price. The Trust on behalf of each Fund has the right to\nreject an order for Creation Units if the purchaser (or a group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the applicable Fund and if, pursuant to\nSection 351 of the Code, the applicable Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market\nvalue of the securities on the date of deposit. The Trust also has the right to require information\nnecessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination. If the Trust 177\ndoes issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a group of purchasers) that would, upon obtaining the Fund\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the applicable Fund, the purchaser (or group\nof purchasers) will not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of securities for Creation Units. If a Fund\nredeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear additional costs and recognize more capital gains than it would\nif it redeems Creation Units in-kind. Certain Tax-Exempt Investors. A Fund, if investing in certain limited\nreal estate investments and other publicly traded partnerships, may be required to pass through certain\n\u201cexcess inclusion income\u201d and other income as \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d (\u201cUBTI\u201d). Prior to\ninvesting in a Fund, tax-exempt investors sensitive to UBTI should consult their tax advisors regarding this\nissue and IRS pronouncements addressing the treatment of such income in the hands of such investors.\nNon-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income dividends paid by a Fund to shareholders who are non-resident aliens or\nforeign entities will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than distributions reported\nby the Fund as interest-related dividends and short-term capital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty rate\napplies or unless such income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. In general, a Fund may\nreport interest-related dividends to the extent of its net income derived from U.S.-source interest and a\nFund may report short-term capital gain dividends to the extent its net short-term capital gain for the\ntaxable year exceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains on the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. will\ngenerally be subject to U.S. federal net income taxation at regular income tax rates. Non-U.S. shareholders\nthat own, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of a Fund's shares are urged to consult their own tax\nadvisors concerning special tax rules that may apply to their investment. Unless certain non-U.S. entities\nthat hold Fund Shares comply with IRS requirements that will generally require them to report information\nregarding U.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts with, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions (other than exempt-interest dividends) payable to such entities. A non-U.S.\nshareholder may be exempt from the withholding described in this paragraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and a foreign government, provided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the terms of such agreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund will be\nrequired in certain cases to withhold (as \u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts (including exempt-interest\ndividends) payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund either an incorrect tax identification\nnumber or no number at all, (2) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report\npayments of interest or dividends, (3) has failed to certify to the Fund that such shareholder is not\nsubject to backup withholding, or (4) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will not be applied\nto payments that have been subject to the 30% withholding tax on shareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States. Other Tax Issues. A Fund may be subject to tax in certain states\nwhere the Fund does business (or is treated as doing business as a result of its investments). Furthermore,\nin those states which have income tax laws, the tax treatment of the Funds and of Fund shareholders with\nrespect to distributions by the Funds may differ from federal tax treatment. The foregoing discussion\nsummarizes some of the consequences under current federal income tax law of an investment in the Funds. It\nis not a substitute for personal tax advice. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax\nconsequences of an investment in the Funds under all applicable tax laws. General Information The Trust was\norganized as a Massachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998. If shareholders of any Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled to one vote for each Fund Share they own. Annual meetings of\nshareholders will not be held except as required by the 1940 Act and other applicable law. See the SAI for\nmore information concerning the Trust's form of organization. Management and Organization Each Fund is a\nseparate series of the Trust, which is an open-end registered management investment company. 178 From time\nto time, a Fund may advertise yield and total return figures. Yield is a historical measure of dividend\nincome, and total return is a measure of past dividend income (assuming that it has been reinvested) plus\ncapital appreciation. Neither yield nor total return should be used to predict the future performance of a\nFund. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel to the Trust, including the Funds. Ernst & Young LLP\nserves as the independent registered public accounting firm and will audit the Funds' financial statements\nannually. Financial Highlights These financial highlight tables are intended to help you understand each\nFund's financial performance for the past five fiscal years or, if shorter, the period since each Fund's\ninception. Certain information reflects the performance results for a single Fund Share. The total returns\nin the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in each Fund\n(assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions). This information has been audited by Ernst &\nYoung LLP, the Trust's independent registered public accounting firm, whose report, along with each Fund's\nfinancial highlights and financial statements, is included in the Form N-CSR, which is available upon\nrequest. Any references to Notes in these financial highlight tables refer to the \u201cNotes to Financial\nStatements\u201d section of each Fund's financial statements, and the financial information included in these\ntables should be read in conjunction with the financial statements incorporated by reference in the SAI. 179\n\nSPDR SERIES TRUST FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Selected data for a share outstanding

You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.10%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.10%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $10        $32     $56     $128  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 9 % of the average value\nof its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\nIn seeking to track the performance of the MSCI USA Climate\nParis Aligned Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective.\n\n4\n\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in\nthe securities comprising the Index. In addition, in\nseeking to track the Index, the Fund may invest in equity\nsecurities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index, the Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to the extent\nthat the Index concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. Futures contracts (a type of\nderivative instrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to the Index and in managing\ncash flows. The Index is designed to exceed the minimum\nstandards for a \u201cParis-Aligned Benchmark\u201d under the EU BMR.\nA Paris-Aligned Benchmark is designed to align with a\nprincipal objective of the Paris Agreement (a binding\ninternational treaty agreement on climate change) to limit\nthe increase in the global average temperature to well\nbelow 2 degrees Celsius (preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius)\nabove pre-industrial levels. The initial universe from\nwhich the Index selects constituents is the MSCI USA Index\n(the \u201cParent Index\u201d), which measures the performance of the\nlarge- and mid-capitalization segments of the U.S. equity\nmarket. To construct the universe of constituents eligible\nfor inclusion in the Index (the \u201cEligible Universe\u201d), the\nParent Index is first screened to remove securities of\nissuers based on the following exclusionary criteria: \u2022 All\ncompanies producing cluster bombs, landmines, depleted\nuranium, chemical or biological weapons, blinding laser\nweapons, non-detectable fragments or incendiary weapons;\nproducing key components of cluster bombs, landmines,\ndepleted uranium weapons, or chemical or biological\nweapons; owning 20% or more (50% for financial companies)\nof a weapons or components producer; or that are 50% or\nmore owned by a company involved in weapons or components\nproduction. \u2022 All companies assigned an MSCI ESG\n(environmental, social or governance) Controversy Score of\n0 or that are not assigned an MSCI ESG Controversy Score. \u2022\nAll companies that produce tobacco or derive 5% or more\naggregate revenue from the production, distribution, retail\nand supply of tobacco-related products. \u2022 All companies\nassigned an MSCI Environmental Controversy Score of 0 or 1.\n\u2022 All companies deriving 1% or more revenue from mining of\nthermal coal and its sale to external parties (excluding\nall revenue from metallurgical coal, coal mined for\ninternal power generation, intracompany sales of mined\nthermal coal, and coal trading). \u2022 All companies deriving\n10% or more revenue from oil and gas related activities,\nincluding distribution / retail, equipment and services,\nextraction and production, petrochemicals, pipelines and\ntransportation and refining (excluding biofuel production\nand sales and trading activities). \u2022 All companies deriving\n50% or more revenue from thermal coal based, liquid fuel\nbased and natural gas based power generation. \u2022 All\ncompanies that produce firearms and small arms ammunitions\nfor civilian markets (excluding companies that cater to\nmilitary, government and law enforcement markets) or derive\n5% or more revenue from the production and distribution of\nfirearms or small arms ammunition intended for civilian\nuse. \u2022 All companies that (i) manufacture nuclear warheads\nand/or whole nuclear missiles; (ii) manufacture components\nthat were developed or are significantly modified for\nexclusive use in nuclear warheads and/or nuclear missiles;\n(iii) manufacture or assemble delivery platforms that were\ndeveloped or significantly modified for the exclusive\ndelivery of nuclear weapons; (iv) provide auxiliary\nservices related to nuclear weapons; (v) manufacture\ncomponents that were not developed or not significantly\nmodified for exclusive use in nuclear warheads and/or\nnuclear missiles but can be used in nuclear weapons; (vi)\nmanufacture or assemble delivery platforms that were not\ndeveloped or not significantly modified for the exclusive\ndelivery of nuclear weapons but have the capability to\ndeliver nuclear weapons; and (vii) manufacture components\nfor nuclear-exclusive delivery platforms. The Index\nProvider incorporates data drawn from a number of sources\nfor applying the exclusionary screens. An MSCI ESG\nControversy Score provides an assessment of controversies\nconcerning any negative environmental, social, and/or\ngovernance impact of a company's operations, products, and\nservices. To evaluate ESG controversies, the Index Provider\nmonitors across five categories of ESG impact \u2013\nenvironment, human rights and communities, labor rights and\nsupply chain, customers and governance \u2013 and 28 sub-\ncategories. MSCI ESG Controversy Scores fall on a 0-10\nscale, with 0 representing a company assessed as having\ninvolvement in very severe controversies. An MSCI\nEnvironmental Controversy Score provides an assessment of\ncontroversies related to a company's impact on the\nenvironment. Environmental controversies can relate to,\namong other things, toxic emissions and waste, operational\n5 waste (non-hazardous), energy and climate change, water\nstress, biodiversity and land use, and supply chain\nmanagement. MSCI Environmental Controversy Scores fall on a\n0-10 scale, with 0 and 1 representing a company having\nfaced very severe and severe controversies pertaining to\nenvironmental issues, respectively. The final portfolio of\nsecurities is constructed using an optimization process\nthat seeks to select and weight securities from the\nEligible Universe based on constraints designed to (i)\nminimize the Index's exposure to physical and transition\nrisks of climate change (\u201ctransition and physical risk\nobjectives\u201d) and (ii) target exposure to sustainable\ninvestment opportunities (\u201ctransition opportunities\nobjectives\u201d). In addition, the optimization process also\nincorporates target constraints to seek to minimize the\nrisk of significant differences in constituent or sector\nweightings relative to the Parent Index, while aiming to\ncontrol for constituent turnover and minimize tracking\nerror relative to the Parent Index (\u201ctarget diversification\nconstraints\u201d). The optimization process incorporates the\nfollowing Index-level constraints to achieve transition and\nphysical risk objectives: \u2022 At least 50% reduction in the\nweighted average of index constituents' greenhouse gas\n(\u201cGHG\u201d) Intensity relative to the Parent Index, taking into\naccount Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Scope 1 emissions are\ndirect GHG emissions that occur from sources that are\ncontrolled or owned by an organization. Scope 2 emissions\nare indirect GHG emissions generated in the production of\nelectricity consumed by the organization. Scope 3 emissions\nencompass all other indirect GHG emissions that are a\nconsequence of the activities of the organization, but\noccur from sources not owned or controlled by the\norganization. GHG Intensity measures a company's Scope 1, 2\nand 3 emissions relative to its enterprise value including\ncash. MSCI ESG Research uses a proprietary estimation model\nto calculate all Scope 3 emissions, and Scope 1 and Scope 2\nemissions for companies who do not report GHG emissions. \u2022\nAt least 10% average reduction (per year) in GHG Intensity\nrelative to GHG Intensity of the Index as of June 1, 2020.\n\u2022 Aggregate exposure to High Climate Impact Sectors that is\nnot less than the aggregate exposure in the Parent Index.\nHigh Impact Climate Sectors are defined by EU BMR as those\nsectors that are key to the low-carbon transition. \u2022 At\nleast 20% increase, relative to the Eligible Universe, in\nthe aggregate weight of companies (i) having one or more\nactive carbon emissions reduction target(s) approved by the\nScience Based Targets initiative (SBTi), or (ii) companies\nthat (a) publish emissions reduction targets, (b) publish\ntheir annual emissions levels, and (c) have reduced their\nGHG intensity by at least 7% over each of the last three\nyears. \u2022 At least 50% reduction in the weighted average of\nindex constituents' Potential Emissions Intensity relative\nto the Parent Index. Potential Emissions Intensity\nrepresents the sum of a company's estimated carbon\nemissions assuming the company uses its owned coal, oil and\ngas reserves relative to the company's enterprise value\nincluding cash. \u2022 Aggregate Climate Value-at-Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\ngreater than or equal to -5% of the aggregate Climate VaR\nof the Parent Index. Climate VaR is designed to provide a\nforward looking assessment of the impacts of climate change\non a company's valuation based on various global average\ntemperature warming scenarios. \u2022 At least 5% increase in\nthe weighted average of index constituents' Low Carbon\nTransition (LCT) Score relative to the Parent Index. The\nLCT Score seeks to identify a company's exposure to and\nmanagement of risk and opportunities related to low carbon\ntransition. \u2022 At least 50% reduction in the weighted\naverage of index constituents' Physical Risk Climate VaR\n(Aggressive Scenario) relative to the Parent Index.\nPhysical Climate VaR ( Aggressive Scenario) is an\nassessment of a company's \u201cworst-case\u201d (95 th percentile)\nfuture costs arising from extreme weather events and the\npotential impact of such costs on the company's future\nfinancial performance, assuming emissions and temperatures\nrise steadily, reaching approximately 4\u00b0C of global warming\nin 2100. The optimization process incorporates the\nfollowing Index-level constraints to achieve transition\nopportunities objectives: \u2022 At least 5% increase in\nweighted average of index constituents' LCT Score relative\nto Parent Index. \u2022 At least 400% increase in the ratio of\nWeighted Average Green Revenue/Weighted Average Fossil\nFuel-based Revenue relative to the Parent Index. Weighted\nAverage Green Revenue represents the weighted average of\nindex constituents' percentage of revenue derived from\nalternative energy, energy efficiency, sustainable water,\ngreen building, pollution prevention, and sustainable\nagriculture. Weighted Average Fossil Fuel-based Revenue\nrepresents the weighted average of index constituents'\npercentage of revenue derived from the mining of thermal 6\ncoal (excluding metallurgical coal, coal mined for internal\npower generation, intra-company sales of mined thermal coal\nand revenue from coal trading) or its sale to external\nparties, extraction, production and refining of\nconventional and unconventional oil and gas, and power\ngeneration based on thermal coal, liquid fuel, and natural\ngas. \u2022 At least 100% increase in Weighted Average Green\nRevenue relative to the Parent Index. \u2022 An Index Implied\nTemperature Rise of 2 degrees Celsius or below. The Index\nProvider's Implied Temperature Rise model estimates the\nIndex constituents' alignment to a specific global\ntemperature rise scenario based on projected forward-\nlooking emissions. Companies that do not have data\navailable to calculate Implied Temperature Rise are still\neligible for Index inclusion but are not considered for the\nIndex Implied Temperature Rise calculation. \u2022 Aggregate\nCumulative Projected Emissions aligned with an Implied\nTemperature Rise of 1.5 degrees or below. Cumulative\nProjected Emissions is an estimation of a company's total\ncarbon emissions until 2050, based on decarbonization\nassumptions. Companies that do not have data available to\ncalculate Cumulative Projected Emissions are still eligible\nfor Index inclusion but are not considered in the Index-\nlevel aggregation. The Index's optimization process\nincorporates information and data from internal and\nexternal (e.g., issuers, government agencies and non-profit\norganizations) sources, including research, reports,\npublications or public records. The Index is rebalanced and\nreconstituted on a semi-annual basis, as of the close of\nthe last business day of May and November. The optimization\nprocess described above is applied in connection with the\nsemi-annual Index review. During the semi-annual Index\nreview, in the event the Index-level constraints are not\nmet through the optimization process, certain target\ndiversification constraints will be relaxed until the\nIndex-level constraints are achieved. As of August 31,\n2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies\nin the technology and financial sectors, although this may\nchange from time to time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index\ncomprised 254 stocks. The Index is sponsored by MSCI, Inc.\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. ESG Investing Risk: The Index's incorporation of ESG\nconsiderations in its methodology may cause the Fund to\nmake different investments than funds that do not\nincorporate such considerations in their strategy or\ninvestment processes. Under certain economic conditions,\nthis could cause the Fund's investment performance to be\nworse than funds that do not incorporate such\nconsiderations. The Index's incorporation of ESG\nconsiderations may affect the Fund's exposure to certain\nsectors and/or types of investments, and may adversely\nimpact the Fund's performance depending on whether such\nsectors or investments are in or out of favor in the\nmarket. The Index methodology incorporates data and scores\nprovided by third parties, which may be unavailable or\nlimited for certain issuers and/or only take into account\none or a few of many ESG related components of portfolio\ncompanies. In instances where data or scores are\nunavailable or limited, (i) the Index may include, and the\nFund may therefore hold, securities of companies that\notherwise would not be included or held if data or scores\nwere available or more complete, or (ii) the Index, and\ntherefore the Fund, may exclude securities of companies\nthat 7 otherwise would have been included or held if data\nor scores were available or more complete. In addition, ESG\ninformation and scores across third party data providers,\nindexes and other funds may differ and/or be incomparable.\nTo the extent circumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and the Fund may\ntherefore hold for a period of time, securities of\ncompanies that do not align with the Fund's ESG-related\nobjectives and/or criteria. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the\nsecondary market at market prices. The trading prices of\nFund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the\nFund's daily net asset value per share and there may be\ntimes when the market price of the shares is more than the\nnet asset value per share (premium) or less than the net\nasset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened\nin times of market volatility or periods of steep market\ndeclines. Financial Sector Risk: Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive governmental regulation,\nwhich may limit both the amounts and types of loans and\nother financial commitments they can make, the interest\nrates and fees they can charge, the scope of their\nactivities, the prices they can charge and the amount of\ncapital they must maintain. Profitability is largely\ndependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or\ndue to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of\nthe credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in\na broad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and 8\nincurs costs in buying and selling securities. In addition,\nthe Fund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Large-Capitalization Securities\nRisk: Returns on investments in securities of large\ncompanies could trail the returns on investments in\nsecurities of smaller and mid-sized companies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable to respond as quickly as smaller\nand mid-sized companies to competitive challenges or to\nchanges in business, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high rates that may be achieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and mid-sized companies. Limited Track\nRecord Risk: The Fund has a limited track record and there\nis no assurance that the Fund will grow quickly. When the\nFund's size is small, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume, which could lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if\nthe Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing\nexchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause\nelevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax\nconsequences for its shareholders. Mid-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk: The securities of mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile and may involve more risk\nthan the securities of larger companies. These companies\nmay have limited product lines, markets or financial\nresources, may lack the competitive strength of larger\ncompanies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Non-Diversification Risk: As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of portfolio\nsecurities than many other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of issuers, a decline\nin the market value of a particular security held by the\nFund may affect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be\nmore volatile than the values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. The Fund may become diversified for periods of time\nsolely as a result of tracking the Index (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or more component securities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or economic factors impacting\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both domestically\nand internationally, including competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs. Stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Technology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. 9\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Lisa Hobart,\nEmiliano Rabinovich and Karl Schneider. Lisa Hobart is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 2006. Emiliano Rabinovich,\nCFA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 2006. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of\nthe Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC\n(the \u201cExchange\u201d), other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund\n\n10\n\nShares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest\nprice a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to\naccept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital\ngains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information. 11\n\nSPDR \u00ae MSCI USA Gender Diversity ETF\n                                                   \n  Investment Objective                             \n  The SPDR MSCI USA Gender Diversity ETF seeks to  \n  provide investment results that, before fees     \n  andexpenses, correspond generally to the total   \n  return performance of an index that tracks U.S.  \n  large- and mid-cap companies exhibiting certain  \n  gender diversity and diversity management        \n  characteristics.                                 \n                                                   \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.20%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.20%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 46 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the MSCI\nUSA Gender Diversity Select Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is\nnot required to purchase all of the securities represented\nin the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of\nthe securities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the same risk and\nreturn characteristics of the Index. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of\nthese factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or\nthe \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either\nmay invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in\nthe Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially\nall of the securities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the Index, as\ndetermined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the\nFund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market\nconditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all,\nbut at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are\nnot included in the Index. The Fund may also invest in cash\nand cash equivalents or money market instruments (including\nmoney market funds advised by the Adviser) for cash\nmanagement purposes. In seeking to track the Index, the\nFund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\n\n12\n\nThe MSCI USA Gender Diversity Select Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d) is\ndesigned to represent the performance of companies that\nexhibit a commitment towards promoting and maintaining a\nhigh level of gender diversity across the different levels\nwithin their organization, including their corporate board,\nexecutive and senior management, and workforce. The\nselection universe for the Index includes all constituents\nin the MSCI USA Index (the \u201cParent Index\u201d), which is\ndesigned to measure the performance of the large- and mid-\ncap segments of the U.S. market. The Parent Index includes\ncompanies classified as United States companies by the\nIndex Provider generally based on the company's country of\nincorporation and the primary listing of its securities.\nThe Index incorporates certain gender diversity and\nenvironmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) metrics\ndeveloped by MSCI ESG Research (a subsidiary of the Index\nProvider (defined below)) to score and screen each security\nwithin the Parent Index. Companies in the Parent Index are\nfirst assigned an ESG Controversy Score, which provides an\nassessment of controversies concerning any negative\nenvironmental, social and/or governance impact of a\ncompany's operations, products and services. ESG\nControversy Scores fall on a 0-10 scale, with 0\nrepresenting a company assessed as having involvement in\nvery severe controversies. The Parent Index is screened to\nremove (i) companies with an ESG Controversy Score of 0 and\n(ii) companies not assigned an ESG Controversy Score. In\naddition, the Parent Index is also screened to remove\ncompanies with a Labor Rights \u2013 Discrimination and\nWorkforce Diversity Controversy score of 0 or 1, which are\ncompanies determined as having involvement in certain very\nsevere or severe workforce diversity controversies. Factors\naffecting this evaluation include, but are not limited to,\na history of involvement in discrimination- related legal\ncases, widespread or egregious instances of discrimination\non the basis of sex, race, or ethnicity, resistance to\nimproved practices, and workplace discrimination-related\ncriticism and allegations by non-governmental organizations\nand/or other third-party observers. The remaining\nsecurities are each assigned an MSCI Gender Diversity Score\nbased on two components: a Women Representation Score and a\nDiversity Management Score. The Women Representation Score\nreflects 75% of the weight of the MSCI Gender Diversity\nScore and evaluates each company based on the following\ncriteria and the company's disclosure of such criteria: (i)\npercent/number of women on the board of directors, (ii)\npercent of women in executive management positions, (iii)\npercent of women in senior management positions, and (iv)\npercent of all employees who are women. The Diversity\nManagement Score represents the remaining 25% of the weight\nof the MSCI Gender Diversity Score and evaluates each\ncompany based on the following criteria: (i) workforce\ndiversity policies and senior management oversight of such\npolicies; (ii) programs to help attract, retain and promote\nwomen in the workforce, including explicit quantitative\nrecruitment targets and employee benefits; and (iii)\nability to attract, retain and develop human capital based\non its provision of benefits, training and development\nprograms, and employee engagement. Companies are not\neligible for inclusion in the Index if they have (i) no\nwomen serving on the board of directors and no women\nserving in executive management positions or (ii) a Women\nRepresentation Score of 3 or less (based on a 0-10 scale).\nFor each GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard)\nsector, companies are selected for inclusion in the Index\nprimarily in decreasing order of MSCI Gender Diversity\nScore until 50% of the free float adjusted market\ncapitalization (calculated by multiplying the number of\nshares readily available in the market by the price of such\nshares) of the sector is reached. The selected securities\nare weighted by the product of their market capitalization\nweight in the Parent Index and the MSCI Gender Diversity\nScore. The weights are then distributed proportionally to\nsum to 100%. Sector weights in the Index are set equal to\nthe corresponding sector weight in the Parent Index. To\nmitigate concentration risk, each security's weight in the\nIndex is capped at 4.5%, and any weight exceeding this\nlimit will be redistributed on a pro-rata basis to\nsecurities that do not exceed the 4.5% limit. The index is\nrebalanced quarterly, and changes are implemented at the\nend of February, May, August and November. As of August 31,\n2024, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies\nin the technology sector, although this may change from\ntime to time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised 220\nsecurities. The Index is sponsored by MSCI, Inc. (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the Fund or\nthe Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition\nof the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex and publishes information regarding the market value\nof the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund As\nwith all investments, there are certain risks of investing\nin the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you\ncould lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation or any other government\nagency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are subject to\nchanges in general economic conditions, general market\nfluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, 13 and general market liquidity. The Fund is\nsubject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. ESG Investing Risk: The Index's incorporation of ESG\nconsiderations in its methodology may cause the Fund to\nmake different investments than funds that do not\nincorporate such considerations in their strategy or\ninvestment processes. Under certain economic conditions,\nthis could cause the Fund's investment performance to be\nworse than funds that do not incorporate such\nconsiderations. The Index's incorporation of ESG\nconsiderations may affect the Fund's exposure to certain\nsectors and/or types of investments, and may adversely\nimpact the Fund's performance depending on whether such\nsectors or investments are in or out of favor in the\nmarket. The Index methodology incorporates data and scores\nprovided by third parties, which may be unavailable or\nlimited for certain issuers and/or only take into account\none or a few of many ESG related components of portfolio\ncompanies. In instances where data or scores are\nunavailable or limited, (i) the Index may include, and the\nFund may therefore hold, securities of companies that\notherwise would not be included or held if data or scores\nwere available or more complete, or (ii) the Index, and\ntherefore the Fund, may exclude securities of companies\nthat otherwise would have been included or held if data or\nscores were available or more complete. In addition, ESG\ninformation and scores across third party data providers,\nindexes and other funds may differ and/or be incomparable.\nTo the extent circumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and the Fund may\ntherefore hold for a period of time, securities of\ncompanies that do not align with the Fund's ESG-related\nobjectives and/or criteria. Gender Diversity Risk: The\nreturns on a portfolio of securities that excludes\ncompanies that are not gender diverse may trail the returns\non a portfolio of securities that includes companies that\nare not gender diverse. Investing only in a portfolio of\nsecurities of companies that are gender diverse may affect\nthe Fund's exposure to certain types of investments and may\nadversely impact the Fund's performance depending on\nwhether such investments are in or out of favor in the\nmarket. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset\nvalue per share and there may be times when the market\nprice of the shares is more than the net asset value per\nshare (premium) or less than the net asset value per share\n(discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. Futures\nContract Risk: A futures contract is a standardized\nagreement that calls for the purchase or sale of a specific\nasset at a specific price at a specific future time, or\ncash settlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions\nin futures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or 14 at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Large-Capitalization Securities\nRisk: Returns on investments in securities of large\ncompanies could trail the returns on investments in\nsecurities of smaller and mid-sized companies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable to respond as quickly as smaller\nand mid-sized companies to competitive challenges or to\nchanges in business, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high rates that may be achieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and mid-sized companies. Mid-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk: The securities of mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile and may involve more risk\nthan the securities of larger companies. These companies\nmay have limited product lines, markets or financial\nresources, may lack the competitive strength of larger\ncompanies, and may depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been recently organized\nand may have little or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held securities.\nSome securities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may\nbe restricted as to resale, and their values may be\nvolatile. Technology Sector Risk: Market or economic\nfactors impacting technology companies and companies that\nrely heavily on technological advances could have a major\neffect on the value of the Fund's investments. The value of\nstocks of technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, including competition\nfrom foreign competitors with lower production costs.\nStocks of technology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are heavily dependent\non patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology sector may face\ndramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Valuation Risk: Certain portfolio holdings\nmay be valued on the basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods\nthat can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology\nor if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques other than market\nquotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be\nsubject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one\nday to the next than if market quotations were used. In\naddition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund\nat that time. 15\n\nFund Performance The following bar chart and table provide\nan indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by\nshowing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year\nand by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for\ncertain time periods compare with the average annual\nreturns of the Index and of a relevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The Fund's past performance (before and\nafter taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the\nFund will perform in the future. Updated performance\ninformation is available by calling 1-866-787-2257 or\nvisiting our website at https://www.ssga.com .\n\nAnnual Total Returns (years ended 12/31)\n                                                   \n                            Returns  Quarter/Year  \n  Highest Quarterly Return  20.85%   Q2 2020       \n  Lowest Quarterly Return   -23.16%  Q1 2020       \n  Year-to-Date              21.37%   9/30/2024     \n                                                   \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods ended 12/31/23) The after-tax returns presented in the table below\nare calculated using highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the\nimpact of state and local taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation\nand may differ from those shown below. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns\nafter taxes can exceed the returns before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from\nrealizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. Effective December 8, 2022 (the \u201cBenchmark Index Change\nDate\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index changed from the SSGA Gender Diversity Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark\nIndex\u201d) to the MSCI USA Gender Diversity Select Index, consistent with a change in the Fund's principal\ninvestment strategy to track the performance of the current index. Performance of the Fund prior to the\nBenchmark Index Change Date is therefore based on the Fund's investment strategy to track the Previous\nBenchmark Index and may have been different had the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                                                                          \n                                                      OneYear  FiveYears  SinceInception  \n  3/7/2016                                                                                \n  Return Before Taxes                                 22.35%   10.00%     9.67%           \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions                 21.91%   9.60%      8.60%           \n  Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of     13.49%   7.87%      7.40%           \n  Fund Shares                                                                             \n  MSCI USA Gender Diversity Select Index/SSGA Gender                                      \n  Diversity Index1(reflects no deduction forfees,     22.57%   10.18%     9.85%           \n  expenses or taxes)                                                                      \n  S&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees,      26.29%   15.69%     13.80%          \n  expenses or taxes)                                                                      \n                                                                                          \n1 Returns shown are reflective of the Index for periods beginning on the Benchmark Index Change Date and the\nPrevious Benchmark Index for periods prior to the Benchmark Index Change Date. Portfolio Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. The Adviser and certain of its\naffiliates intend to make contributions to a charitable organization, which is tax-exempt under section\n501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), developed to provide financial\nsupport to third party charitable organizations which seek to enhance gender equity through educational\nefforts. Charitable contributions from the Adviser and certain of its affiliates will be benchmarked to the\nassets under management of the Fund. The charitable organization will seek to make donations to identified\ncharitable organizations that support continuing educational efforts designed to mitigate gender inequality\nin corporate America, and will aim to engage with other organizations in an effort to increase the amount of\nphilanthropic dollars available for such initiatives. The charitable organization will not participate in,\nor have any influence on the day-to-day operations of, the Fund or the Adviser's management of the Fund.\n\n16\n\nPortfolio Managers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Amy\nCheng, Kathleen Morgan, and Amy Scofield. Amy Cheng is a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 2000. Kathleen Morgan, CFA,\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic Equity Beta Group. She\njoined the Adviser in 2017. Amy Scofield is a Principal of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the\nSystematic Equity Beta Group. She joined the Adviser in 2010. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or\ncash. Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national\nsecurities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When\nbuying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a\nseller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com.\nTax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k)\nplan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be\ntaxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may\npay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services\nrelated to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another\ninvestment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information. 17\n\nSPDR \u00ae S&P 500 \u00ae ESG ETF\n                                                  \n  Investment Objective                            \n  The SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to  \n  provide investment results that, before fees    \n  andexpenses, correspond generally to the total  \n  return performance of an index that provides    \n  exposure tosecurities that meet certain         \n  sustainability criteria (criteria related to    \n  environmental, social and governance(\u201cESG\u201d)     \n  factors) while maintaining similar overall      \n  industry group weights as the S&P 500 Index.    \n                                                  \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy,\nhold and sell shares of the Fund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.10%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.10%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $10        $32     $56     $128  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 12 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P 500\nESG Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling\nstrategy, which means that the Fund is not required to\npurchase all of the securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the securities\nin the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities\nwith generally the same risk and return characteristics of\nthe Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be\nbased on a number of factors, including asset size of the\nFund. Based on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the\nFund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may\ninvest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the\nsame proportions as the Index, as determined by the Adviser\nto be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is classified as \u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; however,\nthe Fund may become \u201cnon-diversified\u201d solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or\nmore component securities). When the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may invest a relatively high percentage of\nits assets in a limited number of issuers. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially\nall, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in equity securities\nthat are not included in the Index. The Fund may also\ninvest in cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments (including money market funds advised by the\nAdviser) for cash management purposes. In seeking to track\nthe Index,\n\n18\n\nthe Fund's assets may be concentrated in an industry or\ngroup of industries, but only to the extent that the Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative\ninstrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking performance\nthat corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows.\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of\nsecurities meeting certain sustainability criteria\n(criteria related to ESG factors), while maintaining\nsimilar overall industry group weights as the S&P 500\nIndex. Securities eligible for inclusion in the Index\ncomprise all constituents of the S&P 500 Index except for:\n\u2022 Companies that meet any of the following Business\nInvolvement Exclusions, based on revenue levels as\ndetermined by S&P Global, Inc. (an affiliate of the Index\nProvider (defined below)): \u2022 Companies that derive any\namount of revenue from manufacturing tobacco products, 5%\nor greater of their revenue from supplying products and\nservices essential for the tobacco industry, or 5% or\ngreater of their revenue from the distribution and/or\nretail sale of tobacco products; \u2022 \u201cControversial Weapons\nCompanies,\u201d defined as companies that derive any amount of\nrevenue from (i) manufacturing components intended solely\nfor use in the production of and are essential for the\nfunctioning of anti-personnel mines, biological and\nchemical weapons, blinding laser weapons, cluster\nmunitions, depleted uranium, incendiary weapons and nuclear\nweapons (collectively, \u201cControversial Weapons\u201d), or (ii)\nproducts and/or services related to the sale, supply and\ntransfer of Controversial Weapons; \u2022 Companies that derive\n5% or greater of their revenue from the extraction and/or\nproduction of fossil fuels from oil/tar sands; \u2022 Companies\nthat (i) derive any amount of revenue from the\nmanufacturing of small arms weapons for civilian or non-\ncivilian use, or key components of assault weapons; or (ii)\nderive 5% or greater of their revenue from the retail or\ndistribution of small arms weapons for civilian customers;\n\u2022 Companies that derive 10% or greater of their revenue\nfrom (i) manufacturing, assembling, selling and\ntransporting weapons, equipment, structures, and vehicles,\nor providing vehicle and equipment maintenance services and\nlogistics and operations support, specifically for the\npurposes of warfare, or (ii) manufacturing and selling\nmilitary weapon-related products; or \u2022 Companies that\nderive 5% or greater of their revenue from (i) owning\nand/or operating coal mines that engage in thermal coal\nmining or (ii) electricity generation using coal powered\nplants. \u2022 Companies that hold 25% or greater ownership\nstakes (as determined by S&P Global, Inc.) in: \u2022 Companies\nthat derive any amount of revenue from manufacturing\ntobacco products; \u2022 Controversial Weapons Companies; or \u2022\nCompanies that derive any amount of revenue from the\nmanufacturing of small arms weapons for civilian and non-\ncivilian use, or key components of assault weapons. \u2022\nCompanies that are classified by Sustainalytics to be non-\ncompliant with the United Nations Global Compact (\u201cUNGC\u201d)\nprinciples (\u201cNon-Compliant UNGC Companies\u201d). Non-Compliant\nUNGC Companies are (i) companies found to have been\nresponsible for egregious and severe violations of commonly\naccepted international norms related to human rights, labor\nrights, the environment and business ethics, or (ii)\ncompanies deemed to facilitate third parties in human\nrights violations due to their involvement in certain\nweapons with disproportional and/or non-discriminatory\nimpact on citizens and society; \u2022 Companies that have an\nS&P Global ESG Score that falls within the worst 25% of\nscores from each Global Industry Classification Standard\n(GICS) industry group in the underlying universe of\ncompanies eligible for inclusion in the Index (the\n\u201cInvestment Universe\u201d); or \u2022 Companies that do not have (i)\ncoverage for determining tobacco-, controversial weapons-,\noil sands-, small arms-, military weapons- and thermal\ncoal-related involvement or compliance with UNGC\nprinciples; or (ii) an S&P Global ESG Score. S&P Global ESG\nScores are assigned by S&P Global, Inc. using its Corporate\nSustainability Assessment, which is an annual evaluation of\na company, based on ESG factors that S&P Global, Inc.\ndetermines are financially material to the company,\nrelative to its industry peer companies. After implementing\nthe exclusion criteria described above, the remaining\ncompanies are then ranked based on their S&P Global ESG\nScore. For each GICS industry group, companies are selected\nfor inclusion in the Index primarily in decreasing order of\nS&P Global ESG Score until approximately 75% of the float\nadjusted market capitalization of the industry group is\nreached. 19 The Index is float-adjusted market\ncapitalization weighted. A company's float-adjusted market\ncapitalization is calculated by multiplying the number of\nshares readily available in the market by the price of such\nshares. The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced annually\non the last business day in April based on information as\nof the last trading date in March. In addition, companies\nwill be removed from the Index (i) on the last business day\nof July, October and January, if found to meet a Business\nInvolvement Exclusion as of the last business day of the\nprevious month, or (ii) on the third Friday of March, June,\nSeptember and December if found to be a Non-Compliant UNGC\nCompany as of the last business day of the previous month.\nIn addition, between Index rebalances, Index constituents\nmay be removed from the Index for their involvement in\neconomic crime and corruption, fraud, illegal commercial\npractices, human rights abuses, labor disputes, workplace\nsafety catastrophic accidents, environmental disasters, and\ncertain other activities associated with environmental,\nsocial and governance risks. Any companies removed from the\nIndex on account of such activities are not eligible for\ninclusion in the Index until one full calendar year from\nthe next rebalancing of the Index. As of August 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised companies in the\ntechnology sector, although this may change from time to\ntime. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised of 320\nstocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. ESG Investing Risk: The Index's incorporation of ESG\nconsiderations in its methodology may cause the Fund to\nmake different investments than funds that do not\nincorporate such considerations in their strategy or\ninvestment processes. Under certain economic conditions,\nthis could cause the Fund's investment performance to be\nworse than funds that do not incorporate such\nconsiderations. The Index's incorporation of ESG\nconsiderations may affect the Fund's exposure to certain\nsectors and/or types of investments, and may adversely\nimpact the Fund's performance depending on whether such\nsectors or investments are in or out of favor in the\nmarket. The Index methodology incorporates data and scores\nprovided by third parties, which may be unavailable or\nlimited for certain issuers and/or only take into account\none or a few of many ESG related components of portfolio\ncompanies. In instances where data or scores are\nunavailable or limited, (i) the Index may include, and the\nFund may therefore hold, securities of companies that\notherwise would not be included or held if data or scores\nwere available or more complete, or (ii) the Index, and\ntherefore the Fund, may exclude securities of companies\nthat otherwise would have been included or held if data or\nscores were available or more complete. In addition, ESG\ninformation and scores across third party data providers,\nindexes and other funds may differ and/or be incomparable.\nTo the extent circumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and the Fund may\ntherefore hold for a period of time, securities of\ncompanies that do not align with the Fund's ESG-related\nobjectives and/or criteria. Large-Capitalization Securities\nRisk: Returns on investments in securities of large\ncompanies could trail the returns on investments in\nsecurities of smaller and mid-sized companies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable to respond as quickly as smaller\nand mid-sized companies to competitive challenges or to\nchanges in business, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high rates that may be achieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and mid-sized companies. 20 Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and\nsold in the secondary market at market prices. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ\nfrom the Fund's daily net asset value per share and there\nmay be times when the market price of the shares is more\nthan the net asset value per share (premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or periods of\nsteep market declines. Futures Contract Risk: A futures\ncontract is a standardized agreement that calls for the\npurchase or sale of a specific asset at a specific price at\na specific future time, or cash settlement of the terms of\nthe contract. Transactions in futures contracts can create\ninvestment leverage and may have significant volatility. It\nis possible that a futures contract transaction will result\nin a much greater loss than the principal amount invested,\nand the Fund may not be able to close out the futures\ncontract at a favorable time or price. There is no\nassurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange\nwill exist for any particular futures contract. In the\nevent no such market exists, it might not be possible to\neffect closing transactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate its exposure to the futures contract. There is\nalso a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in\nthe prices of the futures contract and movements in the\nprice of the underlying assets. The counterparty to a\nfutures contract may be unable or unwilling to make timely\nsettlement payments, return the Fund's margin, or otherwise\nhonor its obligations. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or\nprojected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an\nactively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform\na benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may\nbe less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an\nactive investment strategy. The structure and composition\nof the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of the Index and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time\nand may not be identified and corrected by the Index\nProvider for a period of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the\nextent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the\nIndex may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may\nattempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Non-Diversification Risk: To the\nextent the Fund becomes \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d the Fund may\nhold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many\nother funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively\nsmall number of issuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may affect its value\nmore than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values\nof shares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become\nnon-diversified for periods of time solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or\nmore component securities). Technology Sector Risk: Market\nor economic factors impacting technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological advances could\nhave a major effect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable\nto rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and internationally,\nincluding competition from foreign competitors with lower\nproduction costs. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology, especially those\nof smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more\nvolatile than the overall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual property\nrights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely\naffect profitability. Additionally, companies in the\ntechnology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for the services of\nqualified personnel. 21\n\nUnconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund may invest a\nsubstantial portion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may change from time\nto time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or\nindustries increases the potential for volatility and the\nrisk that events negatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's Shares to decrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.

Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold on the\nNYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices\nrather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is\navailable at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as\nordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from\nsuch tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as\na bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.

You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and\nother fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.12%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses                         0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.12%  \n                                                \nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of\ninvesting in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods\nindicated, and then sell or hold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also\nassumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such\nas commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or\n\u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover\nrate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result\nin higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable\naccount. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual\nFund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the\nFund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio turnover rate was 47 % of the average\nvalue of its portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 ESG Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a\nsampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in\nthe Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of\nsecurities with generally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in\nthe Fund will be based on a number of factors, including\nasset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the\nIndex or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all\nof the securities represented in the Index in approximately\nthe same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing\nits objective. Under normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of\nits total assets in the securities comprising the Index. In\naddition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the\nIndex. The Fund may also invest in cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments (including money\nmarket funds advised by the Adviser) for cash management\npurposes. In seeking to track the Index, the Fund's assets\nmay be concentrated in an industry or group of industries,\nbut only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by\nthe Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows.\n\n24\n\nThe Index is designed to measure the performance of\nsecurities meeting certain sustainability criteria\n(criteria related to ESG factors), while maintaining\nsimilar overall industry group weights as the S&P SmallCap\n600 Index. The S&P SmallCap 600 Index measures the\nperformance of the small-capitalization segment of the U.S.\nequity market. Securities eligible for inclusion in the\nIndex comprise all constituents of the S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex except for: \u2022 Companies that meet any of the\nfollowing Business Involvement Exclusions, based on revenue\nlevels as determined by S&P Global, Inc. (an affiliate of\nthe Index Provider (defined below)): \u2022 Companies that\nderive any amount of revenue from manufacturing tobacco\nproducts, 5% or greater of their revenue from supplying\nproducts and services essential for the tobacco industry,\nor 5% or greater of their revenue from the distribution\nand/or retail sale of tobacco products; \u2022 \u201cControversial\nWeapons Companies,\u201d defined as companies that derive any\namount of revenue from (i) manufacturing components\nintended solely for use in the production of and are\nessential for the functioning of anti-personnel mines,\nbiological and chemical weapons, blinding laser weapons,\ncluster munitions, depleted uranium, incendiary weapons and\nnuclear weapons (collectively, \u201cControversial Weapons\u201d), or\n(ii) products and/or services related to the sale, supply\nand transfer of Controversial Weapons; \u2022 Companies that\nderive 5% or greater of their revenue from the extraction\nand/or production of fossil fuels from oil/tar sands; \u2022\nCompanies that (i) derive any amount of revenue from the\nmanufacturing of small arms weapons for civilian or non-\ncivilian use, or key components of assault weapons; or (ii)\nderive 5% or greater of their revenue from the retail or\ndistribution of small arms weapons for civilian customers;\n\u2022 Companies that derive 10% or greater of their revenue\nfrom (i) manufacturing, assembling, selling and\ntransporting weapons, equipment, structures, and vehicles,\nor providing vehicle and equipment maintenance services and\nlogistics and operations support, specifically for the\npurposes of warfare , or (ii) manufacturing and selling\nmilitary weapon-related products; or \u2022 Companies that\nderive 5% or greater of their revenue from (i) owning\nand/or operating coal mines that engage in thermal coal\nmining or (ii) electricity generation using coal powered\nplants. \u2022 Companies that hold 25% or greater ownership\nstakes (as determined by S&P Global, Inc.) in: \u2022 Companies\nthat derive any amount of revenue from manufacturing\ntobacco products; \u2022 Controversial Weapons Companies; or \u2022\nCompanies that derive any amount of revenue from the\nmanufacturing of small arms weapons for civilian and non-\ncivilian use, or key components of assault weapons. \u2022\nCompanies that are classified by Sustainalytics to be non-\ncompliant with the United Nations Global Compact (\u201cUNGC\u201d)\nprinciples (\u201cNon-Compliant UNGC Companies\u201d). Non-Compliant\nUNGC Companies are (i) companies found to have been\nresponsible for egregious and severe violations of commonly\naccepted international norms related to human rights, labor\nrights, the environment and business ethics, or (ii)\ncompanies deemed to facilitate third parties in human\nrights violations due to their involvement in certain\nweapons with disproportional and/or non-discriminatory\nimpact on citizens and society; \u2022 Companies that (i) have\nan S&P Global ESG Score that falls within the worst 25% of\nscores from each Global Industry Classification Standard\n(GICS) industry group in the underlying universe of\ncompanies eligible for inclusion in the Index (the\n\u201cInvestment Universe\u201d), or (ii) fall within the worst 10%\nof scores in the Investment Universe. If less than 75% of\nthe weight of the Investment Universe remains eligible,\nconstraints (i) and (ii) will be relaxed; or \u2022 Companies\nthat do not have (i) coverage for determining tobacco-,\ncontroversial weapons-, oil sands-, small arms-, military\nweapons- and thermal coal-related involvement or compliance\nwith UNGC principles; or (ii) an S&P Global ESG Score. S&P\nGlobal ESG Scores are assigned by S&P Global, Inc., using\nits Corporate Sustainability Assessment, which is an annual\nevaluation of a company, based on ESG factors that S&P\nGlobal, Inc. determines are financially material to the\ncompany, relative to its industry peer companies. After\nimplementing the exclusion criteria described above, the\nremaining companies are then ranked based on their S&P\nGlobal ESG Score. For each GICS industry group, companies\nare selected for inclusion in the Index primarily in\ndecreasing order of S&P Global ESG Score until\napproximately 75% of the float adjusted market\ncapitalization of the industry group is reached. 25 The\nIndex is float-adjusted market capitalization weighted. A\ncompany's float-adjusted market capitalization is\ncalculated by multiplying the number of shares readily\navailable in the market by the price of such shares. The\nIndex is reconstituted and rebalanced annually on the last\nbusiness day in April based on information as of the last\ntrading date in March. In addition, companies will be\nremoved from the Index (i) on the last business day of\nJuly, October and January, if found to meet a Business\nInvolvement Exclusion as of the last business day of the\nprevious month, or (ii) on the third Friday of March, June,\nSeptember and December if found to be a Non-Compliant UNGC\nCompany as of the last business day of the previous month.\nIn addition, between Index rebalances, Index constituents\nmay be removed from the Index for their involvement in\neconomic crime and corruption, fraud, illegal commercial\npractices, human rights abuses, labor disputes, workplace\nsafety catastrophic accidents, environmental disasters, and\ncertain other activities associated with environmental,\nsocial and governance risks. Any companies removed from the\nIndex on account of such activities are not eligible for\ninclusion in the Index until one full calendar year from\nthe next rebalancing of the Index. As of August 31, 2024, a\nsignificant portion of the Fund comprised companies in the\nfinancial and industrial sectors, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of July 31, 2024, the Index comprised\n392 stocks. The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not affiliated with\nthe Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes information regarding\nthe market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing\nin the Fund As with all investments, there are certain\nrisks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in\nvalue, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.\nAn investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency. Market Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic conditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and\nprices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors including, but not limited to, economic\ngrowth or recession, changes in interest rates, inflation,\nchanges in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of\nissuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject\nto the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global economies\nand markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a significant impact on\nthe Fund and its investments. Equity Investing Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go\nup or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value\nof a security may decline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not\nspecifically related to a particular company. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall over short or extended periods of\ntime. ESG Investing Risk: The Index's incorporation of ESG\nconsiderations in its methodology may cause the Fund to\nmake different investments than funds that do not\nincorporate such considerations in their strategy or\ninvestment processes. Under certain economic conditions,\nthis could cause the Fund's investment performance to be\nworse than funds that do not incorporate such\nconsiderations. The Index's incorporation of ESG\nconsiderations may affect the Fund's exposure to certain\nsectors and/or types of investments, and may adversely\nimpact the Fund's performance depending on whether such\nsectors or investments are in or out of favor in the\nmarket. The Index methodology incorporates data and scores\nprovided by third parties, which may be unavailable or\nlimited for certain issuers and/or only take into account\none or a few of many ESG related components of portfolio\ncompanies. In instances where data or scores are\nunavailable or limited, (i) the Index may include, and the\nFund may therefore hold, securities of companies that\notherwise would not be included or held if data or scores\nwere available or more complete, or (ii) the Index, and\ntherefore the Fund, may exclude securities of companies\nthat otherwise would have been included or held if data or\nscores were available or more complete. In addition, ESG\ninformation and scores across third party data providers,\nindexes and other funds may differ and/or be incomparable.\nTo the extent circumstances evolve in between\nreconstitutions, the Index may include, and the Fund may\ntherefore hold for a period of time, securities of\ncompanies that do not align with the Fund's ESG-related\nobjectives and/or criteria. Small-Capitalization Securities\nRisk: The securities of small-capitalization companies may\nbe more volatile and may involve more risk than the\nsecurities of larger companies. These companies may have\nlimited product lines, markets or financial resources, may\nlack the competitive strength of larger companies, and may\ndepend on a few key employees. In addition, these companies\nmay have been recently organized and may have little or no\ntrack record of success. The securities of smaller\ncompanies may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held securities. Some securities of\nsmaller issuers may be illiquid or may be restricted as to\nresale, 26 and their values may have significant\nvolatility. The Fund may be unable to liquidate its\npositions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet the Fund's obligations. Returns on\ninvestments in securities of small-capitalization companies\ncould trail the returns on investments in securities of\nlarger companies. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts Risk: As with all exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary\nmarket at market prices. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nin the secondary market may differ from the Fund's daily\nnet asset value per share and there may be times when the\nmarket price of the shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset value per\nshare (discount). This risk is heightened in times of\nmarket volatility or periods of steep market declines.\nFinancial Sector Risk: Financial services companies are\nsubject to extensive governmental regulation, which may\nlimit both the amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the interest rates and\nfees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the\nprices they can charge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the\navailability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate\nsignificantly when interest rates change or due to\nincreased competition. In addition, deterioration of the\ncredit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets, including U.S. and international\ncredit and interbank money markets generally, thereby\naffecting a wide range of financial institutions and\nmarkets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause\nan unusually high degree of volatility in the financial\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain\nfinancial services companies to incur large losses.\nSecurities of financial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies experience\nsubstantial declines in the valuations of their assets,\ntake action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt\nor equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses\nresulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be\nsubject to severe price competition. Adverse economic,\nbusiness or political developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other\nlending or investing activities directly or indirectly\nconnected to the value of real estate. Futures Contract\nRisk: A futures contract is a standardized agreement that\ncalls for the purchase or sale of a specific asset at a\nspecific price at a specific future time, or cash\nsettlement of the terms of the contract. Transactions in\nfutures contracts can create investment leverage and may\nhave significant volatility. It is possible that a futures\ncontract transaction will result in a much greater loss\nthan the principal amount invested, and the Fund may not be\nable to close out the futures contract at a favorable time\nor price. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary\nmarket on an exchange will exist for any particular futures\ncontract. In the event no such market exists, it might not\nbe possible to effect closing transactions, and the Fund\nwill be unable to terminate its exposure to the futures\ncontract. There is also a risk of imperfect correlation\nbetween movements in the prices of the futures contract and\nmovements in the price of the underlying assets. The\ncounterparty to a futures contract may be unable or\nunwilling to make timely settlement payments, return the\nFund's margin, or otherwise honor its obligations. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk: The Fund is managed with an\nindexing investment strategy, attempting to track the\nperformance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless\nof the current or projected performance of the Index or of\nthe actual securities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active investment strategy. The structure\nand composition of the Index will affect the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or the construction of the\nIndex in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may\nhave an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To\nthe extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions,\nthe Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for\na period of time, securities of companies that do not align\nwith the Index's objective and/or criteria. When there are\nchanges made to the component securities of the Index and\nthe Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio,\nany transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and\nits shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to\nreflect changes in the securities included in the Index.\nThe Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index ( i.e. , achieve a high degree of\ncorrelation with the Index), the Fund's return may not\nmatch the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of\noperating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs\ncosts in buying and selling securities. In addition, the\nFund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser 27\nmay attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return\nand that of the Index. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand both for their\nspecific product or service and for industrial sector\nproducts and services in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these companies.\nAerospace and defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly affected by\ngovernment spending policies because companies involved in\nthis industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products and services.\nThus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically\nunder pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities, another\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are cyclical and have\noccasional sharp price movements which may result from\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Limited Track Record Risk: The Fund has a\nlimited track record and there is no assurance that the\nFund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size is small, the\nFund may experience low trading volume, which could lead to\nwider bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain\nconditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting\nliquidation of the Fund could cause elevated transaction\ncosts for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its\nshareholders. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market,\nstressed market conditions, or restrictions on resale may\nlimit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid investments\nmay trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in\nmarket value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund\nShares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit\nthe ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions\non a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments\nand/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of\nexposure to a certain market or sector. Non-Diversification\nRisk: As a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than many other\nfunds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may affect its value\nmore than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values\nof shares of more diversified funds. The Fund may become\ndiversified for periods of time solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or\nmore component securities). Unconstrained Sector Risk: The\nFund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within\none or more economic sectors or industries, which may\nchange from time to time. Greater investment focus on one\nor more sectors or industries increases the potential for\nvolatility and the risk that events negatively affecting\nsuch sectors or industries could reduce returns,\npotentially causing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly. Valuation Risk: Certain\nportfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors\nother than market quotations. This may occur more often in\ntimes of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio\nholding when market quotations are not readily available.\nThe value established for any portfolio holding at a point\nin time might differ from what would be produced using a\ndifferent methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation\nin their valuations from one day to the next than if market\nquotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance\nthat the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position\nfor the value established for it at any time, and it is\npossible that the Fund would incur a loss because a\nportfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to\nthe valuation established by the Fund at that time.

Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Emiliano\nRabinovich and Karl Schneider. Emiliano Rabinovich, CFA, is a Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head\nof the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He joined the Adviser in 2006. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is\na Managing Director of the Adviser and Co-Head of the Systematic Equity Beta Group in the Americas. He\njoined the Adviser in 1997. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of\nFund Shares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit\nor delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may only be\npurchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the \u201cExchange\u201d), other national securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because\nFund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the\n\n29\n\nsecondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is\nwilling to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price, premiums and\ndiscounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com. Tax Information The Fund's\ndistributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual\nretirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you.\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-\ndealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs,\nconferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the\nsale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-\ndealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information. 30 Additional Strategies\nInformation Principal Strategies General . Please see each Fund's \u201cThe Fund's Principal Investment Strategy\u201d\nsection under \u201cFund Summaries\u201d above for a discussion of each Fund's principal investment strategy. A Fund\nmay invest in various types of securities and engage in various investment techniques which are not the\nprincipal focus of the Fund and therefore are not described in this Prospectus. These securities, techniques\nand practices, together with their risks, are described in the Statement of Additional Information (the\n\u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain free of charge by contacting shareholder services (see the back cover of this\nProspectus for the address and phone number). The Adviser seeks to track the performance of each Fund's\nIndex as closely as possible (i.e ., obtain a high degree of correlation with the Index). A number of\nfactors may affect a Fund's ability to achieve a high degree of correlation with its Index, and there can be\nno guarantee that a Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation. For example, a Fund may not be able to\nachieve a high degree of correlation with its Index when there are practical difficulties or substantial\ncosts involved in compiling a portfolio of securities to follow the Index, when a security in the Index\nbecomes temporarily illiquid, unavailable or less liquid, or legal restrictions exist that prohibit the Fund\nfrom investing in a security in the Index. The Adviser will utilize a sampling strategy in managing the\nFunds. Sampling means that the Adviser uses quantitative analysis to select securities, including securities\nin the Index, outside of the Index and derivatives that have a similar investment profile as the relevant\nIndex in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes and other economic characteristics. These include\nindustry weightings, market capitalization, and other financial characteristics of securities. The quantity\nof holdings in a Fund will be based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. In addition,\nfrom time to time, securities are added to or removed from each Index. The Adviser may sell securities that\nare represented in an Index, or purchase securities that are not yet represented in an Index, in\nanticipation of their removal from or addition to an Index. Further, the Adviser may choose to overweight\nsecurities in an Index, purchase or sell securities not in an Index, or utilize various combinations of\nother available techniques, in seeking to track an Index. The SPDR MSCI USA Climate Paris Aligned ETF, SPDR\nMSCI USA Gender Diversity ETF and SPDR S&P SmallCap 600 ESG ETF, as described in the SAI, have adopted a\nnon-fundamental investment policy to invest at least 80% of their respective net assets, plus the amount of\nborrowings for investment purposes, in investments suggested by their respective names, measured at the time\nof investment. The SPDR MSCI USA Climate Paris Aligned ETF, SPDR MSCI USA Gender Diversity ETF and SPDR S&P\nSmallCap 600 ESG ETF will provide shareholders with at least 60 days' notice prior to any change in this\nnon-fundamental 80% investment policy. The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change a Fund's\ninvestment strategy, Index and other policies without shareholder approval, except as otherwise indicated in\nthis Prospectus or in the SAI. The Board may also change a Fund's investment objective without shareholder\napproval. Non-Principal Strategies Certain Other Investments . Each Fund may invest in structured notes\n(notes on which the amount of principal repayment and interest payments are based on the movement of one or\nmore specified factors such as the movement of a particular security or index), swaps and options contracts.\nSwaps and options contracts and structured notes may be used by a Fund in seeking performance that\ncorresponds to its Index and in managing cash flows. Temporary Defensive Positions . In certain situations\nor market conditions, a Fund may temporarily depart from its normal investment policies and strategies,\nprovided that the alternative is consistent with the Fund's investment objective and is in the best interest\nof the Fund. For example, a Fund may make larger than normal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure\nto its Index if it is unable to invest directly in a component security. Borrowing Money . Each Fund may\nborrow money from a bank as permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or\nother governing statute, by the rules thereunder, or by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d)\nor other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund, but only for temporary or emergency purposes. The\n1940 Act presently allows a Fund to borrow from any bank (including pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating\nassets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets (not including temporary borrowings not in excess of\n5% of its total assets). A Fund may also invest in reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing\ntransactions. Consistent with a rule under the 1940 Act, a Fund may treat such investments as either\nborrowings or derivatives 31\n\ntransactions. To the extent a Fund treats reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions as\nborrowings, such investments will also be included in the 33 1/3% limit. Under normal circumstances, any\nborrowings by a Fund (including investments in reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing\ntransactions treated as borrowings) will not exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. Lending of Securities .\nEach Fund may lend its portfolio securities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets\nvia a securities lending program through its securities lending agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company\n(\u201cState Street\u201d or the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions desiring to\nborrow securities to complete transactions and for other purposes. A securities lending program allows a\nFund to receive a portion of the income generated by lending its securities and investing the respective\ncollateral. A Fund will receive collateral for each loaned security which is at least equal to the market\nvalue of that security, marked to market each trading day. To the extent a Fund receives cash collateral, as\nof the date of this Prospectus, the Adviser expects to invest such cash collateral in a Fund managed by the\nAdviser that invests in: a broad range of money market instruments; certificates of deposit and time\ndeposits of U.S. and foreign banks; commercial paper and other high quality obligations of U.S. or foreign\ncompanies; asset-backed securities; mortgage-related securities; repurchase agreements; and shares of money\nmarket funds. With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive\na fee based on the amount of cash collateral. A Fund is compensated by the difference between the amount\nearned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral\nother than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market\nvalue of the loaned securities. In the securities lending program, the borrower generally has the right to\nvote the loaned securities; however, a Fund may call loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the\nFund's economic interest in the investment is to be voted upon. Security loans may be terminated at any time\nby a Fund.

                       \n  Valuation Risk      x                     x                                          x                    \n                                                                                                            \nCounterparty Risk . A Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties with which the\nFund enters into derivatives contracts and other transactions such as repurchase agreements or reverse\nrepurchase agreements. A Fund's ability to profit from these types of investments and transactions will\ndepend on the willingness and ability of its counterparty to perform its obligations. If a counterparty\nfails to meet its contractual obligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund. A Fund may experience significant delays in\nobtaining any recovery in an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any collateral posted by it) and may obtain only a limited recovery or\nmay obtain no recovery in such circumstances. If a Fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty, it may\nbe delayed or prevented from realizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding relating to the counterparty. Under applicable law or contractual provisions, including if a Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with a financial institution and such financial institution (or an\naffiliate of the financial institution) experiences financial difficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from exercising its rights to terminate the investment or transaction, or\nto realize on any collateral and may result in the suspension of payment and delivery obligations of the\nparties under such investment or transactions or in another institution being substituted for that financial\ninstitution without the consent of the Fund. Further, a Fund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the financial institution's authority, the financial institution's\nliabilities could be written down, eliminated or converted into equity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial institution may result in a reduction in value of some or all of its\nsecurities and, if a Fund holds such securities or has entered into a transaction with such a financial\nsecurity when a bail-in occurs, the Fund may also be similarly impacted. Derivatives Risk. A derivative is a\nfinancial contract the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset,\ninterest rate, or index. Derivative transactions typically involve leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a derivative transaction will result in a loss greater than the principal\namount invested, and a Fund may not be able to close out a derivative transaction at a favorable time or\nprice. Risks associated with derivative 33\n\ninstruments include potential changes in value in response to interest rate changes or other market\ndevelopments or as a result of the counterparty's credit quality; the potential for the derivative\ntransaction not to have the effect the Adviser anticipated or a different or less favorable effect than the\nAdviser anticipated; the failure of the counterparty to the derivative transaction to perform its\nobligations under the transaction or to settle a trade; possible mispricing or improper valuation of the\nderivative instrument; imperfect correlation in the value of a derivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that a Fund may be required to post collateral or margin with its\ncounterparty, and will not be able to recover the collateral or margin in the event of the counterparty's\ninsolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will experience losses on its derivatives investments and on\nits other portfolio investments, even when the derivatives investments may be intended in part or entirely\nto hedge those portfolio investments; the risks specific to the asset underlying the derivative instrument;\nlack of liquidity for the derivative instrument, including, without limitation, absence of a secondary\ntrading market; the potential for reduced returns to a Fund due to losses on the transaction and an increase\nin volatility; the potential for the derivative transaction to have the effect of accelerating the\nrecognition of gain; and legal risks arising from the documentation relating to the derivative transaction.\nFutures Contract Risk . The risk of loss relating to the use of futures contracts is potentially unlimited.\nThe ability to establish and close out positions in futures contracts will be subject to the development and\nmaintenance of a liquid secondary market. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an\nexchange will exist for any particular futures contract or at any particular time. In the event no such\nmarket exists, it might not be possible to effect closing transactions, and a Fund will be unable to\nterminate the futures contract. In using futures contracts, a Fund will be reliant on the ability of the\nAdviser to predict market and price movements correctly; the skills needed to use such futures contracts\nsuccessfully are different from those needed for traditional portfolio management. If a Fund uses futures\ncontracts for hedging purposes, there is a risk of imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of\nthe futures contracts and movements in the securities or index underlying the futures contracts or movements\nin the prices of the Fund's investments that are the subject of such hedge. The prices of futures contracts,\nfor a number of reasons, may not correlate perfectly with movements in the securities or index underlying\nthem. For example, participants in the futures markets are subject to margin deposit requirements. Such\nrequirements may cause investors to take actions with respect to their futures positions that they would not\notherwise take. The margin requirements in the futures markets may be less onerous than margin requirements\nin the securities markets in general, and as a result those markets may attract more speculators than the\nsecurities markets do. Increased participation by speculators in those markets may cause temporary price\ndistortions. Due to the possibility of price distortion, even a correct forecast of general market trends by\nthe Adviser still may not result in a successful futures activity over a very short time period. The risk of\na position in a futures contract may be very large compared to the relatively low level of margin a Fund is\nrequired to deposit. A Fund will typically be required to post margin with its futures commission merchant\nin connection with its transactions in futures contracts. In many cases, a relatively small price movement\nin a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to the\nsize of a required margin deposit. A Fund will incur brokerage fees in connection with its futures\ntransactions. In the event of an insolvency of the futures commission merchant or a clearing house, a Fund\nmay not be able to recover all (or any) of the margin it has posted with the futures commission merchant, or\nto realize the value of any increase in the price of its positions, or it may experience a significant delay\nin doing so. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have\nestablished limits referred to as \u201cspeculative position limits\u201d on the maximum net long or net short\npositions that any person and certain affiliated entities may hold or control in a particular futures\ncontract. In addition, federal position limits apply to swaps that are economically equivalent to futures\ncontracts that are subject to CFTC-set speculative limits. All positions owned or controlled by the same\nperson or entity, even if in different accounts, must be aggregated for purposes of complying with position\nlimits. It is possible that the positions of different clients managed by the Adviser may be aggregated for\nthis purpose. Therefore, the trading decisions of the Adviser may have to be modified and positions held by\na Fund liquidated in order to avoid exceeding such limits. The modification of investment decisions or the\nelimination of open positions, if it occurs, may adversely affect the performance of a Fund. A violation of\nposition limits could also lead to regulatory action materially adverse to a Fund's investment strategy. In\naddition, exchanges may establish accountability levels applicable to a futures contract instead of position\nlimits, provided that the futures contract is not subject to federal position limits. An exchange may order\na person who holds or controls a position in excess of a position accountability level not to further\nincrease its position, to comply with any prospective limit that exceeds the size of the position owned or\ncontrolled, or to reduce any open position that exceeds the position accountability level if the exchange\ndetermines 34 that such action is necessary to maintain an orderly market. Position accountability levels\ncould adversely affect a Fund's ability to establish and maintain positions in commodity futures contracts\nto which such levels apply, if the Fund were to trade in such contracts, and a Fund's ability to achieve its\ninvestment objective. Futures contracts traded on markets outside the U.S. are not generally subject to the\nsame level of regulation by the CFTC or other U.S. regulatory entities as contracts traded in the U.S.,\nincluding without limitation as to the execution, delivery, and clearing of transactions. U.S. regulators\nneither regulate the activities of a foreign exchange, nor have the power to compel enforcement of the rules\nof the foreign exchange or the laws of the foreign country in question. Margin and other payments made by a\nFund may not be afforded the same protections as are afforded those payments in the U.S., including in\nconnection with the insolvency of an executing or clearing broker or a clearinghouse or exchange. Certain\nforeign futures contracts may be less liquid and more volatile than U.S. contracts. Equity Investing Risk .\nThe market prices of equity securities owned by a Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that may directly relate to the\nissuer, such as management performance, financial leverage, non-compliance with regulatory requirements, and\nreduced demand for the issuer's goods or services. The values of equity securities also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company, such as\nreal or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings,\nchanges in interest or currency rates, or adverse investor sentiment generally. In addition, equity markets\ntend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time. ESG\nInvesting Risk . An Index's incorporation of environmental, social and/or governance considerations in its\nmethodology may cause a Fund to make different investments than funds that do not incorporate such\nconsiderations in their investment strategy or processes. An Index's incorporation of ESG considerations may\naffect a Fund's exposure to certain sectors and/or types of investments, and may adversely impact a Fund's\nperformance depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. In\naddition, a Fund's investments in certain companies may be susceptible to various factors that may impact\ntheir businesses or operations, including costs associated with government budgetary constraints that impact\npublicly funded projects and clean energy initiatives, the effects of general economic conditions throughout\nthe world, increased competition from other providers of services, unfavorable tax laws or accounting\npolicies and high leverage. Each Index methodology incorporates data and scores provided by third parties,\nwhich may be unavailable or limited for certain issuers and/or only take into account one or a few of many\nESG related components of portfolio companies. In instances where data or scores are unavailable or limited,\n(i) an Index may include, and a Fund may therefore hold, securities of companies that otherwise would not be\nincluded or held if data or scores were available or more complete, or (ii) an Index, and therefore the\ncorresponding Fund, may exclude securities of companies that otherwise would have been included or held if\ndata or scores were available or more complete. In addition, ESG information and scores across third party\ndata providers, indexes and other funds may differ and/or be incomparable. To the extent circumstances\nevolve in between reconstitutions, an Index may include, and the corresponding Fund may therefore hold for a\nperiod of time, securities of companies that do not align with the Fund's ESG-related objectives and/or\ncriteria. A Fund may invest in companies that do not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular\ninvestor. Financial Sector Risk. Financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental\nregulation, which may limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can\nmake, the interest rates and fees they can charge, the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the availability and\ncost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased\ncompetition. In addition, deterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets, including U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally,\nthereby affecting a wide range of financial institutions and markets. Certain events in the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and\ncause certain financial services companies to incur large losses. Securities of financial services companies\nmay experience a dramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt or equity\nsecurities), or cease operations. Credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment activities can 35 negatively impact the sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be subject to severe price competition. Adverse economic, business or political developments\ncould adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to the value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk . The net asset value of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate with changes\nin the market value of a Fund's securities holdings. The market prices of Fund Shares will generally\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in a Fund's net asset value and supply and demand of Fund Shares on the\nExchange. It cannot be predicted whether Fund Shares will trade below, at or above their net asset value.\nPrice differences may be due, in large part, to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the\nsecondary trading market for Fund Shares will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces\ninfluencing the prices of the securities of the Index trading individually or in the aggregate at any point\nin time. The market prices of Fund Shares may deviate significantly from the net asset value of Fund Shares\nduring periods of market volatility. However, given that Fund Shares can be created and redeemed in Creation\nUnits (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and\nsometimes at premiums to, their net asset value), the Adviser believes that large discounts or premiums to\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares should not be sustained over long periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that Fund Shares normally will trade close to a Fund's net asset\nvalue, disruptions to creations and redemptions or market volatility may result in trading prices that\ndiffer significantly from the Fund's net asset value. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time when\nthe market price is at a premium to the net asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a time when the market\nprice is at a discount to the net asset value of Fund Shares, then the investor may sustain losses. Gender\nDiversity Risk . The returns on a portfolio of securities that excludes companies that are not gender\ndiverse may trail the returns on a portfolio of securities that includes companies that are not gender\ndiverse. Investing only in a portfolio of securities of companies that are gender diverse may affect a\nFund's exposure to certain types of investments and may adversely impact a Fund's performance depending on\nwhether such investments are in or out of favor in the market. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk . Each\nFund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged\nindex of securities. Each Fund will seek to provide investment results that correspond generally to the\nperformance of the Index, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. Each Fund generally will buy and will not sell a security included in the\nIndex as long as the security is part of the Index regardless of any sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the security, even though the Adviser may make a different\ninvestment decision for other actively managed accounts or portfolios that hold the security. As a result, a\nFund's performance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of\nthe Index (in absolute terms and by comparison with other indices) and, consequently, the performance,\nvolatility, and risk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on a Fund and its\nshareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, an Index may include, and the\ncorresponding Fund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not align with\nthe Index's objective and/or criteria. While the Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index (i.e.,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), a Fund's return may not match the return of the Index\nfor a number of reasons. For example, the return on the sample of securities purchased by a Fund (or the\nreturn on securities not included in the Index) may not correlate precisely with the return of the Index.\nEach Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in buying and\nselling securities. In addition, a Fund may not be fully invested at times, either as a result of cash flows\ninto or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between a Fund's return and that of\nthe Index. Changes in the composition of the Index and regulatory requirements also may impact a Fund's\nability to match the return of the Index. The Adviser may apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment\ntechniques 36 to refine or limit the number or types of issuers included in the Index in which a Fund may\ninvest. Application of such screens or techniques may result in investment performance below that of the\nIndex and may not produce results expected by the Adviser. Index tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Pursuant to the Index methodology,\na security may be removed from the Index in the event that it does not comply with the eligibility\nrequirements of the Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced to sell securities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the Index components. When there are changes made to the\ncomponent securities of the Index and a Fund in turn makes similar changes to its portfolio to attempt to\nincrease the correlation between a Fund's portfolio and the Index, any transaction costs and market exposure\narising from such portfolio changes will be borne directly by a Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled\nchanges to the Index may expose a Fund to additional tracking error risk. A Fund may recognize gains as a\nresult of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. A Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains to its shareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income tax consequences. Industrial Sector Risk . Industrial companies are affected by\nsupply and demand both for their specific product or service and for industrial sector products and services\nin general. Government regulation, world events, exchange rates and economic conditions, technological\ndevelopments and liabilities for environmental damage and general civil liabilities will likewise affect the\nperformance of these companies. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of the industrial sector, can\nbe significantly affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely,\nto a significant extent, on U.S. and foreign government demand for their products and services. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which are typically under pressure from efforts to control the U.S.\n(and other) government budgets. Transportation securities, another component of the industrial sector, are\ncyclical and have occasional sharp price movements which may result from changes in the economy, fuel\nprices, labor agreements and insurance costs. Large-Capitalization Securities Risk. Securities issued by\nlarge-capitalization companies may present risks not present in smaller companies. For example, larger\ncompanies may be unable to respond as quickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to competitive challenges\nor to changes in business, product, financial, or other market conditions. Larger companies may not be able\nto maintain growth at the high rates that may be achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-sized companies,\nespecially during strong economic periods. Returns on investments in securities of large companies could\ntrail the returns on investments in securities of smaller and mid-sized companies. Leveraging Risk .\nBorrowing transactions, reverse repurchase agreements, certain derivatives transactions, securities lending\ntransactions and other investment transactions such as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward commitment\ntransactions may create investment leverage. If a Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect\non the Fund's investment portfolio, the value of the Fund will be potentially more volatile and all other\nrisks will tend to be compounded. This is because leverage generally creates investment risk with respect to\na larger base of assets than a Fund would otherwise have and so magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying assets. The use of leverage is considered to be a speculative\ninvestment practice and may result in losses to a Fund. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial investment. The use of leverage may cause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy repayment, interest payment, or margin\nobligations or to meet asset coverage requirements. Limited Track Record Risk . The Fund has a limited track\nrecord and there is no assurance that the Fund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size is small, the Fund\nmay experience low trading volume, which could lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face\nthe risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. Any\nresulting liquidation of the Fund could cause elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax\nconsequences for its shareholders. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk that a Fund may not be able\nto dispose of investments readily at a favorable time or prices (or at all) or at prices approximating those\nat which a Fund currently values them. For example, certain investments may be subject to restrictions on\nresale, may trade in the over-the-counter market or in limited volume, or may not have an active trading\nmarket. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value. It may be difficult for a Fund to value illiquid investments\naccurately. The market for certain investments may become illiquid under adverse market or economic 37\nconditions independent of any specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer. If the\nliquidity of a Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market price of Fund\nShares and the net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nDisposal of illiquid investments may entail registration expenses and other transaction costs that are\nhigher than those for liquid investments. A Fund may seek to borrow money to meet its obligations (including\namong other things redemption obligations) if it is unable to dispose of illiquid investments, resulting in\nborrowing expenses and possible leveraging of the Fund. Market Risk . Market prices of investments held by a\nFund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. A Fund's investments are subject to changes in\ngeneral economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile, and prices of investments can change substantially due to\nvarious factors, including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates,\ninflation, changes in actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers and general market liquidity. Even if\ngeneral economic conditions do not change, the value of an investment in a Fund could decline if the\nparticular industries, sectors or companies in which the Fund invests do not perform well or are adversely\naffected by events. Further, legal, political, regulatory and tax changes also may cause fluctuations in\nmarkets and securities prices. Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of\nterrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on a\nFund and its investments. Due to the interconnectedness of economies and financial markets throughout the\nworld, whether or not a Fund invests in securities of issuers located in or with significant exposure to\ncountries experiencing economic and financial difficulties, the value and liquidity of the Fund's\ninvestments may be negatively affected. A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as COVID-19,\nand efforts to contain its spread, may result in market volatility, inflation, reduced liquidity of certain\ninstruments, disruption in the trading of certain instruments, and systemic economic weakness. The foregoing\ncould impact a Fund and its investments and result in disruptions to the services provided to a Fund by its\nservice providers. Additionally, in March 2023, the shutdown of certain financial institutions raised\neconomic concerns over disruption in the U.S. banking system. There can be no certainty that the actions\ntaken by the U.S. government to strengthen public confidence in the U.S. banking system will be effective in\nmitigating the effects of financial institution failures on the economy and restoring public confidence in\nthe U.S. banking system. Mid-Capitalization Securities Risk . The securities of mid-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile and may involve more risk than the securities of larger companies. These companies may\nhave limited product lines, markets or financial resources, may lack the competitive strength of larger\ncompanies, and may depend on a few key employees. In addition, these companies may have been recently\norganized and may have little or no track record of success. The securities of mid-sized companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities. The prices of these securities may\nfluctuate more sharply than those of other securities, and a Fund may experience some difficulty in\nestablishing or closing out positions in these securities at prevailing market prices. There may be less\npublicly available information about the issuers of these securities or less market interest in these\nsecurities than in the case of larger companies, both of which can cause significant price volatility. Some\nsecurities of mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may be restricted as to resale. Returns on investments in\nsecurities of mid-capitalization companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of larger or\nsmaller companies. Non-Diversification Risk . Funds classified as \u201cnon-diversified\u201d may hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent a Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market value of a particular security held by the Fund may affect its\nvalue more than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile\nthan the values of shares of more diversified funds. A diversified Fund may become non-diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of tracking its Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one or more\ncomponent securities). Small-Capitalization Securities Risk. The securities of small-capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile and may involve more risk than the securities of larger companies. These\ncompanies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources, may lack the competitive strength\nof larger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In addition, these companies may have been\nrecently organized and may have little or no track record of success. The securities of smaller companies\nmay trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities. The prices of these\nsecurities may fluctuate more sharply than those of other securities, and a Fund may experience some\ndifficulty in establishing or closing out positions in these securities at prevailing market prices. There\nmay be less publicly available information about the issuers of these securities or less market interest in\nthese securities than in the 38 case of larger companies, both of which can cause significant price\nvolatility. Some securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may be restricted as to resale. A Fund may\nbe unable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to\nmeet a Fund's obligations. Returns on investments in securities of small-capitalization companies could\ntrail the returns on investments in securities of larger companies. Technology Sector Risk . Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technological advances\ncould have a major effect on the value of the Fund's investments. The value of stocks of technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence, government regulation and competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, including competition from foreign competitors with lower production\ncosts. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel.\nStocks of technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller,\nless-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Technology companies are heavily\ndependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely affect\nprofitability. Additionally, companies in the technology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable\nchanges in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Unconstrained Sector Risk .\nA Fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within one or more economic sectors or industries,\nwhich may change from time to time. When a Fund focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector,\nfinancial, economic, business, and other developments affecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not focused its assets in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector, which may increase the volatility of the Fund. Valuation Risk .\nCertain portfolio holdings may be valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations. This may\noccur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be\nused to value a portfolio holding when market quotations are not readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ from what would be produced using a different\nmethodology or if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using\ntechniques other than market quotations, including \u201cfair valued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations were used. Technological\nissues or other service disruption issues involving third-party service providers may cause a Fund to value\nits investments incorrectly. In addition, there is no assurance that a Fund could sell or close out a\nportfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that a Fund would incur\na loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by a\nFund at that time. Non-Principal Risks Each risk discussed below is a non-principal risk of a Fund to the\nextent it is not identified as a principal risk for such Fund in the preceding \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION\n- PRINCIPAL RISKS\u201d section. Authorized Participants, Market Makers and Liquidity Providers Concentration\nRisk. A Fund has a limited number of financial institutions that may act as Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d),\nwhich are responsible for the creation and redemption activity for a Fund. In addition, there may be a\nlimited number of market makers and/or liquidity providers in the marketplace. To the extent either of the\nfollowing events occur, Fund Shares may trade at a material discount to NAV and possibly face delisting: (i)\nAPs exit the business or otherwise become unable to process creation and/or redemption orders and no other\nAPs step forward to perform these services, or (ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers exit the\nbusiness or significantly reduce their business activities and no other entities step forward to perform\ntheir functions. Cash Transaction Risk . To the extent a Fund sells portfolio securities to meet some or all\nof a redemption request with cash, the Fund may incur taxable gains or losses that it might not have\nincurred had it made redemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, a Fund may pay out higher annual capital\ngain distributions than if the in-kind redemption process was used. Concentration Risk . A Fund's assets may\nbe concentrated in an industry or group of industries, but only to the extent that the Fund's underlying\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial, economic, business, and other developments affecting issuers in\nthat industry, market, or economic sector will have a greater effect on the Fund than if it had not focused\nits assets in that industry, market, or economic sector, which may increase the volatility of the Fund. 39\nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a Fund will be subject to a number of actual or potential\nconflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser or its affiliates may provide services to a Fund, such as\nsecurities lending agency services, custodial, administrative, bookkeeping, and accounting services,\ntransfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities brokerage services, and other services for which the\nFund would compensate the Adviser and/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest in other pooled investment\nvehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise affiliated with the Adviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the Adviser or its affiliates, or the terms on which it enters into\ntransactions with the Adviser or its affiliates will be the most favorable available in the market generally\nor as favorable as the rates the Adviser or its affiliates make available to other clients. Because of its\nfinancial interest, the Adviser will have an incentive to enter into transactions or arrangements on behalf\nof a Fund with itself or its affiliates in circumstances where it might not have done so in the absence of\nthat interest, provided that the Adviser will comply with applicable regulatory requirements. The Adviser\nand its affiliates serve as investment adviser to other clients and may make investment decisions that may\nbe different from those that will be made by the Adviser on behalf of the Funds. For example, the Adviser\nmay provide asset allocation advice to some clients that may include a recommendation to invest in or redeem\nfrom particular issuers while not providing that same recommendation to all clients invested in the same or\nsimilar issuers. The Adviser may (subject to applicable law) be simultaneously seeking to purchase (or sell)\ninvestments for a Fund and to sell (or purchase) the same investment for accounts, funds, or structured\nproducts for which it serves as asset manager, or for other clients or affiliates. The Adviser and its\naffiliates may invest for clients in various securities that are senior, pari passu or junior to, or have\ninterests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by a Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other business activities, may acquire material nonpublic confidential\ninformation that may restrict the Adviser from purchasing securities or selling securities for itself or its\nclients (including the Funds) or otherwise using such information for the benefit of its clients or itself.\nThe foregoing does not purport to be a comprehensive list or complete explanation of all potential conflicts\nof interests which may affect a Fund. A Fund may encounter circumstances, or enter into transactions, in\nwhich conflicts of interest that are not listed or discussed above may arise. Costs of Buying and Selling\nShares . Investors buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or\nother charges imposed by brokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed\namount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small\namounts of Fund Shares. In addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the difference\nbetween the price that an investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at\nwhich an investor is willing to sell Fund Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask prices is\noften referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time for Fund Shares\nbased on trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if Fund Shares have more trading volume\nand market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares have little trading volume and market liquidity. Further,\nincreased market volatility may cause increased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling Fund\nShares, including bid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Fund Shares may significantly reduce investment\nresults and an investment in Fund Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Cybersecurity Risk . With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the\ndependence on computer systems to perform business and operational functions, funds (such as the Funds) and\ntheir service providers (including the Adviser) may be prone to operational and information security risks\nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or technological malfunctions. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions may have\nincreased the scale and sophistication of deliberate cybersecurity attacks, particularly those from nation-\nstates or from entities with nation-state backing. In general, cyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects. Cyber-attacks include, among others, stealing or corrupting\ndata maintained online or digitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information without authorization, and causing operational disruption.\nSuccessful cyber-attacks against, or security breakdowns of, a Fund, the Adviser or a custodian, transfer\nagent, or other affiliated or third-party service provider may adversely affect a Fund or its shareholders.\nFor instance, cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may interfere with the processing of shareholder or\nother transactions, affect a Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the release of private shareholder\ninformation or confidential Fund information, impede trading, cause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial losses, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and\nadditional compliance costs. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may render records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and other 40 data integral to the functioning of a Fund\ninaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. A Fund may also incur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund and its shareholders could be\nnegatively impacted as a result. While the Adviser has established business continuity plans and systems\ndesigned to minimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the use of technology, processes and controls, there\nare inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not\nbeen identified, given the evolving nature of this threat. Each Fund relies on third-party service providers\nfor many of its day-to-day operations, and will be subject to the risk that the protections and protocols\nimplemented by those service providers will be ineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-attack. The\nAdviser does not control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Adviser or the\nFunds. Similar types of cybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions also are present for issuers of\nsecurities in which each Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers,\nand may cause a Fund's investment in such securities to lose value. Index Construction Risk . A security\nincluded in an Index may not exhibit the characteristic or provide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently a Fund's holdings may not exhibit returns consistent with that characteristic or\nexposure. Index Licensing Risk . It is possible that the license under which the Adviser or a Fund is\npermitted to replicate or otherwise use an Index will be terminated or may be disputed, impaired or cease to\nremain in effect. In such a case, the Adviser may be required to replace the Index with another index which\nit considers to be appropriate in light of the investment strategy of a Fund. The use of any such substitute\nindex may have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. In the event that the Adviser is unable to\nidentify a suitable replacement for the Index, it may determine to terminate a Fund. Money Market Fund\nInvestment Risk . An investment in a money market fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or\nguaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Certain money market funds seek to preserve the value\nof their shares at $1.00 per share, although there can be no assurance that they will do so, and it is\npossible to lose money by investing in such a money market fund. A major or unexpected change in interest\nrates or a decline in the credit quality of an issuer or entity providing credit support, an inactive\ntrading market for money market instruments, or adverse market, economic, industry, political, regulatory,\ngeopolitical, and other conditions could cause the share price of such a money market fund to fall below\n$1.00. It is possible that such a money market fund will issue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at times\nwhen the fair value of the money market fund's portfolio per share is more or less than $1.00. None of State\nStreet Corporation, State Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d), State Street Global Advisors, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (\u201cState Street Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an investment in a\nmoney market fund at $1.00 per share. Investors should have no expectation of capital support to a money\nmarket fund from State Street Entities. Other money market funds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV that\nwill fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Shares sold utilizing a floating\nNAV may be worth more or less than their original purchase price. Recent changes in the regulation of money\nmarket funds may affect the operations and structures of money market funds. A money market fund may be\npermitted or required to impose redemption fees during times of market stress. Portfolio Turnover Risk . A\nFund may engage in frequent trading of its portfolio securities. Fund turnover generally involves a number\nof direct and indirect costs and expenses to a Fund, including, for example, brokerage commissions, dealer\nmark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestment in other\nsecurities. The costs related to increased portfolio turnover have the effect of reducing a Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities by the Fund may result in the realization of taxable capital\ngains, including short-term capital gains. A Fund may engage in significant trading of its portfolio\nsecurities in connection with Index rebalancing. Frequent or significant trading may cause a Fund to incur\nadditional transaction costs and experience different tax consequences in comparison to an ETF that does not\nengage in frequent or significant trading. Regulatory Risk. Governmental and regulatory actions may have\nunexpected or adverse consequences on particular markets, strategies, or investments, which may adversely\nimpact a Fund and impair how it is managed. Policy and legislative changes in the United States and in other\ncountries may affect aspects of financial regulation, and may in some instances contribute to decreased\nliquidity and increased volatility in the financial markets. The impact of these changes on the markets, and\nthe practical implications for market participants, may not be fully known for some time. 41\n\nSecurities Lending Risk. Each Fund may lend portfolio securities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value\nof its net assets. For these purposes, net assets shall exclude the value of all assets received as\ncollateral for the loan. Such loans may be terminated at any time. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal to the market value of the\nsecurities loaned by a Fund, marked to market each trading day. A Fund will receive the amount of all\ndividends, interest and other distributions on the loaned securities; however, the borrower has the right to\nvote the loaned securities. A Fund will call loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the\ninvestment is to be voted upon. Efforts to recall such securities promptly may be unsuccessful, especially\nfor foreign securities or thinly traded securities. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may\nlose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner\nor at all. Should the borrower of the securities fail financially, a Fund may experience delays in\nrecovering the securities or exercising its rights in the collateral. Loans are made only to borrowers that\nare deemed by the securities lending agent to be of good financial standing. In a loan transaction, a Fund\nwill also bear the risk of any decline in value of securities provided as collateral or acquired with cash\ncollateral. Each Fund will attempt to minimize this risk by limiting the investment of cash collateral to\nhigh quality instruments of short maturity either directly on behalf of the lending Fund or through one or\nmore joint accounts or funds, which may include those managed by the Adviser. To the extent the collateral\nprovided or investments made with cash collateral differ from securities included in the Index, such\ncollateral or investments may have a greater risk of loss than the securities included in the Index. In\naddition, a Fund will be subject to the risk that any income generated by lending its securities or\nreinvesting cash collateral is lower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower. The Adviser will\ntake into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when overseeing a\nFund's securities lending activity. Trading Issues . Although Fund Shares are listed for trading on the\nExchange and may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the Exchange, there can\nbe no assurance that an active trading market for the Fund Shares will develop or be maintained. Trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the\nExchange, make trading in Fund Shares inadvisable. In addition, trading in Fund Shares on the Exchange is\nsubject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d\nrules. Similar to the shares of operating companies listed on a stock exchange, Fund Shares may be sold\nshort and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While each Fund expects that the ability of Authorized Participants to create and redeem Fund Shares\nat net asset value should be effective in reducing any such volatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such short sales. There can be no assurance that the requirements\nof the Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of a Fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged\nor that Fund Shares will trade with any volume, or at all, on any stock exchange. Management Investment\nAdviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement\n(\u201cInvestment Advisory Agreement\u201d) between the Trust and the Adviser, and, subject to the oversight of the\nBoard, is responsible for the investment management of each Fund. The Adviser provides an investment\nmanagement program for each Fund and manages the investment of each Fund's assets. In addition, the Adviser\nprovides administrative, compliance and general management services to each Fund. The Adviser is a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc., which itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State\nStreet Corporation. The Adviser is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as\namended. The Adviser and certain other affiliates of State Street Corporation make up SSGA. SSGA is one of\nthe world's largest institutional money managers and the investment management arm of State Street\nCorporation. As of June 30, 2024, the Adviser managed approximately $1.01 trillion in assets and SSGA\nmanaged approximately $4.37 trillion in assets. The Adviser's principal business address is One Iron Street,\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210.

The Adviser has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount equal\nto any acquired fund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) for each Fund until October 31, 2025. This waiver and/or reimbursement does not provide for the\nrecoupment by the Adviser of any amounts waived or reimbursed. This waiver and/or reimbursement may not be\nterminated prior to October 31, 2025 except with the approval of the Board. The Adviser pays all expenses of\neach Fund other than the management fee, brokerage expenses, taxes, interest, fees and expenses of the\nIndependent Trustees (including any Trustee's counsel fees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees and\nexpenses and other extraordinary expenses. A discussion regarding the Board's consideration of the\nInvestment Advisory Agreement is provided in the Funds' Form N-CSR filing with the SEC for the period ended\nJune 30, 2024. SSGA FM, as the investment adviser for the Funds, may hire one or more sub-advisers to\noversee the day-to-day investment activities of the Funds. The sub-advisers are subject to oversight by the\nAdviser. The Adviser and SPDR Series Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) have received an exemptive order from the SEC that\npermits the Adviser, with the approval of the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, of\nthe Trust, to retain and amend existing sub-advisory agreements with unaffiliated investment sub-advisers\nfor a Fund without submitting the sub-advisory agreement to a vote of the Fund's shareholders. The Trust\nwill notify shareholders in the event of any change in the identity of such sub-adviser or sub-advisers. The\nAdviser has ultimate responsibility for the investment performance of the Funds due to its responsibility to\noversee each sub-adviser and recommend their hiring, termination and replacement. The Adviser is not\nrequired to disclose fees paid to any unaffiliated sub-adviser retained pursuant to the order. With respect\nto the SPDR MSCI USA Gender Diversity ETF, the Adviser and certain of its affiliates intend to make\ncontributions to a charitable organization, which is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Code,\ndeveloped to provide financial support to third party charitable organizations which seek to enhance gender\nequity through educational efforts. Charitable contributions from the Adviser and certain of its affiliates\nwill be benchmarked to the assets under management of the Fund. The charitable organization will seek to\nmake donations to identified charitable organizations that support continuing educational efforts designed\nto mitigate gender inequality in corporate America, and will aim to engage with other organizations in an\neffort to increase the amount of philanthropic dollars available for such initiatives. The charitable\norganization will not participate in, or have any influence on the day-to-day operations of, the Fund or the\nAdviser's management of the Fund. Portfolio Managers.\nThe Adviser manages the Funds using a team of investment professionals. The team approach is used to create\nan environment that encourages the flow of investment ideas. The portfolio managers within each team work\ntogether in a cohesive manner to develop and enhance techniques that drive the investment process for the\nrespective investment strategy. This approach requires portfolio managers to share a variety of\nresponsibilities, including investment strategy and analysis, while retaining responsibility for the\nimplementation of the strategy within any particular portfolio. The approach also enables the team to draw\nupon the resources of other groups within SSGA. Each portfolio management team is overseen by the SSGA\nInvestment Committee. The table below identifies the professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of each Fund:\n                                                                                               \n  Portfolio Managers                                  Fund                                     \n  Lisa Hobart, Emiliano Rabinovich and KarlSchneider  SPDR MSCI USA Climate Paris Aligned ETF  \n  Amy Cheng, Kathleen Morgan and AmyScofield          SPDR MSCI USA Gender Diversity ETF       \n  Emiliano Rabinovich, Karl Schneider andOlga Winner  SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF                     \n  Emiliano Rabinovich and Karl Schneider              SPDR S&P SmallCap 600 ESG ETF            \n                                                                                               \nAmy Cheng is a Vice President of SSGA and the Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Systematic\nEquity Beta Group.

The Exchange may\nclose early on the business day before certain holidays and on the day after Thanksgiving Day. Exchange\nholiday schedules are subject to change without notice. If you buy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you will pay the secondary market price for Fund Shares. In addition, you may incur customary\nbrokerage commissions and charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the bid and the offered\nprice in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares will fluctuate continuously throughout trading hours based on market supply and demand\nrather than the relevant Fund's net asset value, which is calculated at the end of each business day. Fund\nShares will trade on the Exchange at prices that may be above ( i.e ., at a premium) or below ( i.e ., at a\ndiscount), to varying degrees, the daily net asset value of Fund Shares. The trading prices of Fund Shares\nmay deviate significantly from the relevant Fund's net asset value during periods of market volatility.\nGiven, however, that Fund Shares can be issued and redeemed daily in Creation Units, the Adviser believes\nthat large discounts and premiums to net asset value should not be sustained over long periods. The Exchange\nwill disseminate, every fifteen seconds during the regular trading day, an indicative optimized portfolio\nvalue (\u201cIOPV\u201d) relating to each Fund. The IOPV calculations are estimates of the value of each Fund's net\nasset value per Fund Share. Premiums and discounts between the IOPV and the market price may occur. This\nshould not be viewed as a \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset value per Fund Share. The IOPV is based on the\ncurrent market value of the published basket of portfolio securities and/or cash required to be deposited in\nexchange for a Creation Unit and does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of a Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time. Moreover, the IOPV is generally determined by using current market\nquotations and/or price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other market intermediaries and\nvaluations based on current market rates. The IOPV may not be calculated in the same manner as the NAV,\nwhich (i) is computed only once a day, (ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes into account Fund\nexpenses, and (iii) may be subject, in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, to fair valuation\nat different prices than those used in the calculations of the IOPV. The IOPV price is based on quotes and\nclosing prices from the securities' local market converted into U.S. dollars at the current currency rates\nand may not reflect events that occur subsequent to the local market's close. Therefore, the IOPV may not\nreflect the best possible valuation of a Fund's current portfolio. Neither the Funds nor the Adviser or any\nof their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and\nmake no warranty as to their accuracy. The Funds do not impose any restrictions on the frequency of\npurchases and redemptions; however, the Funds reserve the right to reject or limit purchases at any time as\ndescribed in the SAI. When considering that no restriction or policy was necessary, the Board evaluated the\nrisks posed by market timing activities, such as whether frequent purchases and redemptions would interfere\nwith the efficient implementation of a Fund's investment strategy, or whether they would cause a Fund to\nexperience increased transaction costs. The Board considered that, unlike traditional mutual funds, Fund\nShares are issued and redeemed only in large quantities of shares known as Creation Units, available only\nfrom a Fund directly, and that most trading in a Fund occurs on the Exchange at prevailing market prices and\ndoes not involve the Fund directly. Given this structure, the Board determined that it is unlikely that (a)\nmarket timing would be attempted by a Fund's shareholders or (b) any attempts to market time a Fund by\nshareholders would result in negative impact to the Fund or its shareholders. 47 Distributions Dividends and\nCapital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are entitled to your share of the applicable Fund's income and net\nrealized gains on its investments. Each Fund pays out substantially all of its net earnings to its\nshareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d Each Fund may earn income dividends from stocks, interest from debt\nsecurities and, if participating, securities lending income. These amounts, net of expenses and taxes (if\napplicable), are passed along to Fund shareholders as \u201cincome dividend distributions.\u201d Each Fund will\ngenerally realize short-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets held for one year\nor less. Net short-term capital gains will generally be treated as ordinary income when distributed to\nshareholders. Each Fund will generally realize long-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or\nexchanges assets held for more than one year. Net capital gains (the excess of a Fund's net long-term\ncapital gains over its net short-term capital losses) are distributed to shareholders as \u201ccapital gain\ndistributions.\u201d Income dividend distributions, if any, for the SPDR MSCI USA Climate Paris Aligned ETF, SPDR\nMSCI USA Gender Diversity ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF and SPDR S&P SmallCap 600 ESG ETF are generally\ndistributed to shareholders quarterly, but may vary significantly from period to period. Net capital gains\nfor each Fund are distributed at least annually. Dividends may be declared and paid more frequently or at\nany other time to improve Index tracking or to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code. A\nportion of each distribution may result in a return of capital. You will be notified regarding the portion\nof the distribution which represents a return of capital. Distributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares only if the broker through whom you purchased Fund Shares\nmakes such option available. Distributions which are reinvested will nevertheless be taxable to the same\nextent as if such distributions had not been reinvested. Portfolio Holdings Disclosure The Funds' portfolio\nholdings disclosure policy is described in the SAI. In addition, the identities and quantities of the\nsecurities held by each Fund are disclosed on the Funds' website. Additional Tax Information The following\ndiscussion is a summary of some important U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in a Fund. Your investment in a Fund may have other tax implications. Please consult your tax\nadvisor about federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws applicable to you. Investors, including\nnon-U.S. investors, may wish to consult the SAI tax section for additional disclosure. Each Fund has elected\nor will elect to be a regulated investment company and intends to qualify each year to be treated as such. A\nregulated investment company is generally not subject to tax at the corporate level on income and gains that\nare distributed to shareholders. However, a Fund's failure to qualify for treatment as a regulated\ninvestment company may result in corporate level taxation, and consequently, a reduction in income available\nfor distribution to shareholders. Taxes on Distributions. In general, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in a Fund. The income\ndividends and short-term capital gains distributions you receive from a Fund will be taxed as either\nordinary income or qualified dividend income. Subject to certain limitations, dividends that are reported by\na Fund as qualified dividend income are taxable to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Any\ndistributions of a Fund's net capital gains are taxable as long-term capital gain regardless of how long you\nhave owned Fund Shares. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced\nrates. Distributions in excess of a Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a\ntax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the applicable Fund's shares, and, in general, as\ncapital gain thereafter. In general, dividends may be reported by a Fund as qualified dividend income if\nthey are attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Fund, which, in general, includes\ndividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and certain foreign corporations ( i.e ., certain foreign\ncorporations incorporated in a possession of the United States or in certain countries with a comprehensive\ntax treaty with the United States, and certain other foreign corporations if the 48 stock with respect to\nwhich the dividend is paid is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States),\nprovided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such\ncorporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. A dividend generally will not be\ntreated as qualified dividend income if the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held by\na Fund for fewer than 61 days during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the\ndate on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of certain\npreferred stock, for fewer than 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date. These\nholding period requirements will also apply to your ownership of Fund Shares. Holding periods may be\nsuspended for these purposes for stock that is hedged. Additionally, income derived in connection with a\nFund's securities lending activities will not be treated as qualified dividend income. U.S. individuals with\nincome exceeding specified thresholds are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on all or a portion of\ntheir \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which includes taxable interest, dividends and certain capital gains\n(generally including capital gain distributions and capital gains realized upon the sale of Fund Shares).\nThis 3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of the undistributed net investment income of certain\nshareholders that are estates and trusts. Certain tax-exempt educational institutions will be subject to a\n1.4% tax on net investment income. For these purposes, certain dividends and capital gain distributions, and\ncertain gains from the disposition of Fund Shares (among other categories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net investment income. If you lend your Fund Shares pursuant to\nsecurities lending arrangements you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares\nare held by the borrower) as qualified dividend income. You should consult your financial intermediary or\ntax advisor to discuss your particular circumstances. Distributions paid in January, but declared by a Fund\nin October, November or December of the previous year, payable to shareholders of record in such a month,\nmay be taxable to you in the calendar year in which they were declared. The Funds will inform you of the\namount of your ordinary income dividends, qualified dividend income and capital gain distributions shortly\nafter the close of each calendar year. A distribution will reduce a Fund's net asset value per Fund Share\nand may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the\ndistribution may constitute a return of capital. Derivatives and Other Complex Securities. A Fund may invest\nin complex securities. These investments may be subject to numerous special and complex rules. These rules\ncould affect whether gains and losses recognized by a Fund are treated as ordinary income or capital gain,\naccelerate the recognition of income to a Fund and/or defer a Fund's ability to recognize losses. In turn,\nthese rules may affect the amount, timing or character of the income distributed to you by a Fund. You\nshould consult your personal tax advisor regarding the application of these rules. Foreign Income Taxes.\nInvestment income received by a Fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to foreign income\ntaxes withheld at the source. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries\nwhich may entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of such taxes or exemption from taxes on such income. It is\nimpossible to determine the effective rate of foreign tax for a Fund in advance since the amount of the\nassets to be invested within various countries is not known. If more than 50% of the total assets of a Fund\nat the close of its taxable year consist of certain foreign stocks or securities, the Fund may elect to\n\u201cpass through\u201d to you certain foreign income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. If a Fund\nin which you hold Fund Shares makes such an election, you will be considered to have received as an\nadditional dividend your share of such foreign taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax\ndeduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating\nyour federal income tax. No deduction for such taxes will be permitted to individuals in computing their\nalternative minimum tax liability. If a Fund does not so elect, the Fund will be entitled to claim a\ndeduction for certain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund. Under certain circumstances, if a Fund receives a\nrefund of foreign taxes paid in respect of a prior year, the value of Fund Shares could be affected or any\nforeign tax credits or deductions passed through to shareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign taxes for\nthe current year could be reduced. Foreign Currency Transactions. A Fund's transactions in foreign\ncurrencies, foreign currency denominated debt obligations and certain foreign currency options, futures\ncontracts and forward contracts (and similar instruments) may give rise to ordinary income or loss to the\nextent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned. 49\nIndex Concentration . In order to qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to regulated\ninvestment companies, a Fund must satisfy certain diversification requirements. In particular, a Fund\ngenerally may not acquire a security if, as a result of the acquisition, more than 50% of the value of the\nFund's assets would be invested in (a) issuers in which the Fund has, in each case, invested more than 5% of\nthe Fund's assets and (b) issuers more than 10% of whose outstanding voting securities are owned by the\nFund. Given the concentration of certain indexes tracked by certain Funds in a relatively small number of\nsecurities, it may not be possible for such Funds to fully implement a sampling methodology while satisfying\nthese diversification requirements. A Fund's efforts to satisfy the diversification requirements may affect\na Fund's execution of its investment strategy and may cause a Fund's return to deviate from that of the\nIndex, and a Fund's efforts to track the Index may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy the\ndiversification requirements. If a Fund were to fail to qualify as a RIC, it would be taxed in the same\nmanner as an ordinary corporation, and distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by the Fund\nin computing its taxable income. Taxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales. Any capital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund Shares is generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been\nheld for more than one year and as short-term capital gain or loss if Fund Shares have been held for one\nyear or less, except that any capital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held for six months or less is treated\nas long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to the Fund\nShares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units. A person who exchanges securities for Creation\nUnits generally will recognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the\nmarket value of the Creation Units at the time and the exchanger's aggregate basis in the securities\nsurrendered plus any cash paid for the Creation Units. A person who exchanges Creation Units for securities\nwill generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the exchanger's basis in the\nCreation Units and the aggregate market value of the securities and the amount of cash received. The\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on the\nbasis that there has been no significant change in economic position. Persons exchanging securities should\nconsult their own tax advisor with respect to whether wash sale rules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. Under current federal tax laws, any capital gain or loss realized upon a redemption (or\ncreation) of Creation Units is generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the applicable Fund\nShares (or securities surrendered) have been held for more than one year and as a short-term capital gain or\nloss if the applicable Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have been held for one year or less. If you\ncreate or redeem Creation Units, you will be sent a confirmation statement showing how many Fund Shares you\npurchased or sold and at what price. The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for\nCreation Units if the purchaser (or a group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered,\nown 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the applicable Fund and if, pursuant to Section 351 of the\nCode, the applicable Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of the\nsecurities on the date of deposit. The Trust also has the right to require information necessary to\ndetermine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination. If the Trust does issue Creation\nUnits to a purchaser (or a group of purchasers) that would, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own\n80% or more of the outstanding shares of the applicable Fund, the purchaser (or group of purchasers) will\nnot recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of securities for Creation Units. If a Fund redeems Creation\nUnits in cash, it may bear additional costs and recognize more capital gains than it would if it redeems\nCreation Units in-kind. Non-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income dividends paid by a Fund to shareholders who are\nnon-resident aliens or foreign entities will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than\ndistributions reported by the Fund as interest-related dividends and short-term capital gain dividends),\nunless a lower treaty rate applies or unless such income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, a Fund may report interest-related dividends to the extent of its net income derived\nfrom U.S. source interest, and a Fund may report short-term capital gain dividends to the extent its net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year exceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains on the sale of\nFund Shares and dividends that are, in each case, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or 50\nbusiness within the U.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal net income taxation at regular income tax\nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of a Fund's shares are urged to\nconsult their own tax advisors concerning special tax rules that may apply to their investment. Unless\ncertain non-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply with IRS requirements that will generally require\nthem to report information regarding U.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts with, such entities, a\n30% withholding tax may apply to distributions payable to such entities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be\nexempt from the withholding described in this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government, provided that the shareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such agreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund will be required in certain\ncases to withhold (as \u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided the\nFund either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, (2) is subject to backup withholding\nby the IRS for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, (3) has failed to certify to\nthe Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or (4) has not certified that such\nshareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently\n24%. Backup withholding will not be applied to payments that have been subject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of the United States. Other Tax Issues. A Fund\nmay be subject to tax in certain states where the Fund does business (or is treated as doing business as a\nresult of its investments). Furthermore, in those states which have income tax laws, the tax treatment of\nthe Funds and of Fund shareholders with respect to distributions by the Funds may differ from federal tax\ntreatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current federal income tax law\nof an investment in the Funds. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. Consult your personal tax\nadvisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in the Funds under all applicable tax laws.\nGeneral Information The Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998. If\nshareholders of any Fund are required to vote on any matters, shareholders are entitled to one vote for each\nFund Share they own. Annual meetings of shareholders will not be held except as required by the 1940 Act and\nother applicable law. See the SAI for more information concerning the Trust's form of organization.\nManagement and Organization Each Fund is a separate series of the Trust, which is an open-end registered\nmanagement investment company. From time to time, a Fund may advertise yield and total return figures. Yield\nis a historical measure of dividend income, and total return is a measure of past dividend income (assuming\nthat it has been reinvested) plus capital appreciation. Neither yield nor total return should be used to\npredict the future performance of a Fund. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel to the Trust,\nincluding the Funds. Ernst & Young LLP serves as the independent registered public accounting firm and will\naudit the Funds' financial statements annually. Financial Highlights These financial highlight tables are\nintended to help you understand each Fund's financial performance for the past five fiscal years, or, if\nshorter, the period since a Fund's inception. Certain information reflects the performance results for a\nsingle Fund Share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or\nlost) on an investment in each Fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions). This\ninformation has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the Trust's independent registered public accounting\nfirm, whose report, along with each Fund's financial highlights and financial statements, is included in the\nForm N-CSR, which is available upon request. Any references to Notes in these financial highlight tables\nrefer to the \u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d section of each Fund's financial statements, and the financial\ninformation included
