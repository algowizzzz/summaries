You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.25%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.25%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $26        $80    $141     $318  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 6%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the Dow\nJones U.S. Select REIT\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to provide\na measure of real\nestate securities that\nserve as proxies for\ndirect real estate\ninvesting, in part by\nexcluding securities\nwhose value is not\nalways closely tied to\nthe value of the\nunderlying real\nestate. The reason for\nthe exclusions is that\nperformance of such\nsecurities may be\ndriven by factors\nother than the value\nof real estate. The\nIndex is a market\ncapitalization\nweighted index of\npublicly traded real\nestate investment\ntrusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) and\nis comprised of\ncompanies whose\ncharters are the\nequity ownership and\noperation of\ncommercial and/or\nresidential real\nestate and which\noperate under the REIT\nAct of 1960. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na company must be both\nan equity owner and\noperator of commercial\nand/or residential\nreal estate.\nBusinesses excluded\nfrom the Index\ninclude: those\nclassified under the\nDow Jones REIT/RESI\nIndustry\nClassification\nHierarchy as\n\u201cSpecialty\u201d ( i.e.,\nREIT types that cannot\nbe easily classified\nwithin the Hierarchy,\nincluding net-lease\nREITs, timber REITs,\nrailroad REITs and\ntower REITs), hybrid\nREITS, mortgage REITs,\nreal estate finance\ncompanies, mortgage\nbrokers and bankers,\ncommercial and\nresidential real\nestate brokers and\nestate agents, home\nbuilders, large\nlandowners and\nsubdividers of\nunimproved land, as\nwell as companies that\nhave more than 25% of\ntheir assets in direct\nmortgage investments.\nA company must have a\nminimum float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\nof at least $200\nmillion at the time of\nits inclusion, and at\nleast 75% of the\ncompany's total\nrevenue must be\nderived from the\nownership and\noperation of real\nestate assets. A stock\nmust have a median\ndaily value traded of\nat least $5 million\nfor the three-months\nprior to the\nrebalancing reference\ndate. The Index is\ngenerally rebalanced\nquarterly, and returns\nare calculated on a\nbuy and hold basis\nexcept as necessary to\nreflect the occasional\noccurrence of Index\nchanges in the middle\nof the month. Each\nREIT in the Index is\nweighted by its float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization. That\nis, each security is\nweighted to reflect\nthe attainable market\ncapitalization of the\nsecurity which\nreflects that portion\nof securities shares\nthat are accessible to\ninvestors. The Index\nis priced daily and is\na total return (price\nand income) benchmark.\nAs of July 31, 2021,\nthe Index comprised\n115 REITs. The Index\nis sponsored by S&P\nDow Jones Indices LLC\n(the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with\nthe Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines\nthe composition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Real Estate\nSector Risk: An\ninvestment in a real\nproperty company may\nbe subject to risks\nsimilar to those\nassociated with direct\nownership of real\nestate, including, by\nway of example, the\npossibility of\ndeclines in the value\nof real estate, losses\nfrom casualty or\ncondemnation, and\nchanges in local and\ngeneral economic\nconditions, supply and\ndemand, interest\nrates, environmental\nliability, zoning\nlaws, regulatory\nlimitations on rents,\nproperty taxes, and\noperating expenses.\nSome real property\ncompanies have limited\ndiversification\nbecause they invest in\na limited number of\nproperties, a narrow\ngeographic area, or a\nsingle type of\nproperty. REIT Risk:\nReal estate investment\ntrusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) are\nsubject to the risks\nassociated with\ninvesting in the\nsecurities of real\nproperty companies. In\nparticular, REITs may\nbe affected by changes\nin the values of the\nunderlying properties\nthat they own or\noperate. Further,\nREITs are dependent\nupon specialized\nmanagement skills, 2\nTable of Contents and\ntheir investments may\nbe concentrated in\nrelatively few\nproperties, or in a\nsmall geographic area\nor a single property\ntype. REITs are also\nsubject to heavy cash\nflow dependency and,\nas a result, are\nparticularly reliant\non the proper\nfunctioning of capital\nmarkets. A variety of\neconomic and other\nfactors may adversely\naffect a lessee's\nability to meet its\nobligations to a REIT.\nIn the event of a\ndefault by a lessee,\nthe REIT may\nexperience delays in\nenforcing its rights\nas a lessor and may\nincur substantial\ncosts associated in\nprotecting its\ninvestments. In\naddition, a REIT could\nfail to qualify for\nfavorable regulatory\ntreatment. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more 3\n\nTable of Contents\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Lisa Hobart. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Lisa Hobart is\na Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n2006. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n4\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Some distributions may be\ntreated as a return of capital for tax\npurposes. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund\nShares through a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a bank), the\nAdviser or its affiliates may pay the\nfinancial intermediary for certain activities\nrelated to the Fund, including educational\ntraining programs, conferences, the\ndevelopment of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 5\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeFactSet Innovative Technology ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF  \n  (the                                        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment         \n  results that,                               \n  before fees and expenses, correspond        \n  generally to                                \n  the total return performance of the         \n  FactSet                                     \n  Innovative Technology Index.                \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.45%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 38%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nFactSet Innovative\nTechnology Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index (including\ncommon stock,\npreferred stock,\ndepositary receipts\nand shares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\nFund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to its\nIndex. The Index is\ndesigned to represent\nthe performance of\nU.S.-listed stock and\nAmerican Depository\nReceipts (\u201cADRs\u201d) of\nTechnology companies\nand Technology-related\ncompanies (including\nElectronic Media\ncompanies) within the\nmost innovative\nsegments of the\nTechnology sector and\nElectronic Media sub-\nsector of the Media\nsector, as defined by\nFactSet Research\nSystems, Inc.\n(\u201cFactSet\u201d or the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The\nIndex Provider\nconsiders the most\ninnovative segments of\nthe Technology sector\nand Electronic Media\nsub-sector to be those\nwith the highest\nrevenue growth and\nbelieves that these\ncompanies are often\ninvolved in cutting\nedge research,\ninnovative product and\nservice development,\ndisruptive business\nmodels, or a\ncombination of these\nactivities. In\naddition to\ntraditional Technology\ncompanies, Electronic\nMedia companies are\nincluded in the Index\nbecause of their core\nfocus on technology\nand the integral role\ntechnology plays in\ndetermining how such\ncompanies operate,\ninnovate and compete\nwithin their industry.\nFactSet defines the\nTechnology sector to\ninclude Information\nTechnology Services\nproviders, Hardware\nmanufacturers,\nSoftware\nmanufacturers,\nElectronic Components\nmanufacturers, and\nManufacturing\nEquipment and Services\nproviders. FactSet\ndefines the Electronic\nMedia sub-sector to\ninclude companies that\nproduce media content\nin digital format and\ndeliver, distribute\nand monetize their\ncontent via an\nelectronic medium such\nas the Internet.\nFactSet sector\ndeterminations are\nbased on a\ncomprehensive,\nstructured taxonomy\ndesigned to seek to\noffer precise industry\nclassification of\nglobal companies\naccording to the\nproducts and services\nsold by such companies\n(the \u201cFactSet Revere\nHierarchy\u201d). The\nFactSet Revere\nHierarchy reflects a\nvariable depth\nstructure that, with\nrespect to the Index,\nconsists of twelve\nlevels of increasingly\nspecialized Technology\nor Electronic Media\nsub-sectors.\nTechnology and\nelectronic media\ncompanies are\nclassified or mapped\nto the sub-sectors\nfrom which they each\nderive 50% or more of\ntheir respective\nrevenues. A company\nwill be eligible for\ninclusion in the Index\nif it satisfies the\nfollowing criteria:\n(i) is mapped to a\nTechnology or\nElectronic Media sub-\nsector at the fourth\nlevel or lower (levels\nfour through twelve)\nin the FactSet Revere\nHierarchy; (ii) is\nmapped to a sub-sector\nin the top quartile of\nFactSet's composite\nrevenue growth scoring\nsystem for the\nTechnology sector or\nElectronic Media sub-\nsector (the \u201crevenue\ngrowth scoring\nsystem\u201d); (iii) has a\nmarket capitalization\nof shares publicly\navailable to investors\n(i.e., a \u201cfloat-\nadjusted\u201d market\ncapitalization) above\n$500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) above\n90% or have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization above\n$400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) above\n150%; (iv) is a\nU.S.-listed stock or\nADR; and (v) has not\nhad an initial public\noffering of shares\nwithin three months of\nthe Review Selection\nDay (defined below).\nThe Index is equal-\nweighted to ensure\nthat each of its\ncomponent securities\nis represented in\napproximate equal\ndollar value at each\nreconstitution. The\nIndex is capped at a\nmaximum of 100\nconstituent\nsecurities. If there\nare fewer than 50\nstocks suitable for\ninclusion based on the\neligibility criteria,\nstocks mapped to the\nnext highest-ranked\nquartile of sub-\nsectors would be added\nuntil the minimum\nnumber of Index\nconstituents is met.\nTo ensure that each\ncomponent stock\ncontinues to represent\napproximate equal\nmarket value in the\nIndex, adjustments, if\nnecessary, are made\nannually after the\nclose of trading on\nthe third Friday of\nDecember (the\n\u201cReconstitution Day\u201d)\nbased on information\nas of the last\nbusiness day two weeks\nbefore the\nReconstitution Day\n(the \u201cReview Selection\nDay\u201d). As of July 31,\n2021, the Index was\ncomprised of 96\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by FactSet\n(the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with\nthe Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines\nthe composition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. 7\nTable of Contents\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nElectronic Media\nCompanies Risk:\nElectronic media\ncompanies create, own,\nand distribute various\nforms of technology-\nbased visual, audio,\nand interactive\ncontent, as well as\ninformation databases\nthat they sell or\nlease to others.\nElectronic media\ncompanies can be\nadversely affected by,\namong other things,\nchanges in government\nregulation, intense\ncompetition,\ndependency on patent\nprotection, and rapid\nobsolescence of\nproducts and services\ndue to product\ncompatibility or\nchanging consumer\npreferences.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nare generally subject\nto the same risks as\ntheir underlying\nsecurities, including\npolitical, regulatory,\nand economic risks.\nThere may be less\ninformation publicly\navailable about a\nnon-U.S. entity that\nissues the underlying\nsecurities than about\na U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities\nare not subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\nliquidity risks;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. 8\n\nTable of Contents\nGrowth Stock Risk: The\nprices of growth\nstocks may be based\nlargely on\nexpectations of future\nearnings, and their\nprices can decline\nrapidly and\nsignificantly in\nreaction to negative\nnews. Growth stocks\nmay underperform value\nstocks and stocks in\nother broad style\ncategories (and the\nstock market as a\nwhole) over any period\nof time and may shift\nin and out of favor\nwith investors\ngenerally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on\nchanges in market,\neconomic, and other\nfactors. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Michael Finocchi. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Michael\nFinocchi is a Principal of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $51       $160    $280     $628  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 11%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of The\nGlobal Dow (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis made up of\napproximately 150\ncompanies from around\nthe world. The\ncompanies are selected\nnot just based on size\nand reputation, but\nalso on their\nimportance in the\nglobal economy. The\nIndex has been\ndesigned to cover both\ndeveloped and emerging\ncountries. The Index\nis equal weighted and\nwill be reset to equal\nweights annually each\nSeptember. As of July\n31, 2021, the Index\ncomprised 151 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain 12 Table of\nContents on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nCurrency Risk: The\nvalue of the Fund's\nassets may be affected\nfavorably or\nunfavorably by\ncurrency exchange\nrates, currency\nexchange control\nregulations, and\ndelays, restrictions\nor prohibitions on the\nrepatriation of\nforeign currencies.\nForeign currency\nexchange rates may\nhave significant\nvolatility, and\nchanges in the values\nof foreign currencies\nagainst the U.S.\ndollar may result in\nsubstantial declines\nin the values of the\nFund's assets\ndenominated in foreign\ncurrencies. Depositary\nReceipts Risk:\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible\ntrade barriers,\ncurrency transfer\nrestrictions, a more\nlimited number of\npotential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 13\n\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective May 2, 2011 (the \u201cBenchmark\nIndex Change Date\u201d), the Fund's benchmark\nindex changed from the Dow Jones Global Titans\nIndex (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to The\nGlobal Dow, consistent with a change in the\nFund's principal investment strategy to track\nthe performance of the current index.\nPerformance of the Fund prior to the Benchmark\nIndex Change Date is therefore based on the\nFund's investment strategy to track the\nPrevious Benchmark Index and may have been\ndifferent had the Fund tracked the current\nindex. 14\n\nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                      One     Five    Ten     \n                      Year    Years   Years   \n  Return Before       9.88%   10.95%  7.73%   \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After Taxes  9.37%   10.40%  7.20%   \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions    6.24%   8.68%   6.21%   \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  The Global Dow/Dow                          \n  Jones Global                                \n  Titans Index1                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for                               \n  fees, expenses or   9.76%   10.91%  7.75%   \n  taxes                                       \n  other than                                  \n  withholding taxes                           \n  on reinvested                               \n  dividends)                                  \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for       18.40%  15.22%  13.88%  \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Kathleen Morgan. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Kathleen\nMorgan, CFA, is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions Group. She joined\nthe Adviser in 2017. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 45%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the ICE\nExchange-Listed Fixed\n& Adjustable Rate\nPreferred Securities\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nsecurities that are\nnot included in the\nIndex, cash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of\nnon-convertible\npreferred stock and\nsecurities that are\nfunctionally\nequivalent to\npreferred stock,\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, senior and\nsubordinated debt\n(collectively,\n\u201cPreferred\nSecurities\u201d).\nPreferred Securities\ngenerally pay fixed\nrate distributions\n(but may pay\ndistributions based on\nadjustable rates) and\ntypically have\n\u201cpreference\u201d over\ncommon stock in the\npayment of\ndistributions and the\nliquidation of a\ncompany's assets \u2014\npreference means that\na company must pay\ndistributions on its\nPreferred Securities\nbefore paying\ndividends on its\ncommon stock, and the\nclaims of Preferred\nSecurities holders are\nahead of common\nstockholders' claims\non assets in a\ncorporate liquidation.\nThe Index includes\nPreferred Securities\nthat meet the\nfollowing criteria:\n(i) are non-\nconvertible; (ii) have\na par amount of $25;\n(iii) are primarily\nlisted on the NYSE or\nNASDAQ exchanges, (iv)\nhave a minimum amount\noutstanding of $250\nmillion; (v) are U.S.\ndollar denominated;\n(vi) are rated\ninvestment grade by\none of Moody's\nInvestors Service,\nInc. or Standard &\nPoor's Financial\nServices, LLC ratings\nservices; (vii) are\npublicly registered or\nexempt from\nregistration under the\nSecurities Act of\n1933; (viii) have a\nfixed or floating rate\ncoupon or dividend\nschedule; (ix) have a\nminimum average\nmonthly trading volume\nof at least 250,000\ntrading units during\nthe preceding six\nmonths; and (x) have\nat least 18 months to\nfinal maturity at time\nof issuance and a\nminimum remaining term\nto final maturity of\nat least one day. The\nIndex may include\nsecurities of\ncompanies\nheadquartered outside\nof the United States.\nThe Index does not\ninclude auction rate\npreferred securities,\nconvertible preferred\nshares, securities\nwith a sinking fund,\nshares in closed-end\nfunds, purchase units,\npurchase contracts,\ncorporate pay-in-kind\nsecurities and\nderivative\ninstruments. The Index\nis market\ncapitalization\nweighted. The\naggregate weight of\nsecurities of an\nindividual issuer is\nlimited to 5%, and any\nweight exceeding this\nlimit will be\nredistributed on a\npro-rata basis to\nsecurities of issuers\nthat do not exceed the\n5% limit. In the event\nthe Index includes\nsecurities of fewer\nthan 20 issuers, the\naggregate weight of\neach issuer's\nsecurities will be\nequally weighted and\nthe issuer's\nindividual securities\nwill be weighted on a\npro-rata basis. The\nIndex is rebalanced on\nthe last calendar day\nof each month based on\ninformation available\nup to and including\nthe third business day\nbefore the last\nbusiness day of the\nmonth. As of July 31,\n2021, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe financial sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 156\nPreferred Securities.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby ICE Data Indices,\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with\nthe Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines\nthe composition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Preferred\nSecurities Risk:\nGenerally, Preferred\nSecurity holders have\nno or limited voting\nrights with respect to\nthe issuing company.\nIn addition, Preferred\nSecurities are\ngenerally senior to\ncommon stock, but may\nbe subordinated to\nbonds and other debt\ninstruments in a\ncompany's capital\nstructure and\ntherefore may be\nsubject to greater\ncredit risk than those\ndebt instruments. In\nthe event an issuer of\nPreferred Securities\nexperiences economic\ndifficulties, the\nissuer's Preferred\nSecurities may lose\nsubstantial value due\nto the increased\nlikelihood of deferred\ninterest or dividend\npayments and the fact\nthat the Preferred\nSecurity may be\nsubordinated to other\nsecurities of the same\nissuer. Further,\nbecause many Preferred\nSecurities pay\ninterest or dividends\nat a fixed rate, their\nmarket price can 17\nTable of Contents be\nsensitive to changes\nin interest rates in a\nmanner similar to\nbonds \u2014 that is, as\ninterest rates rise,\nthe value of the\nPreferred Securities\nheld by the Fund are\nlikely to decline. In\naddition, to the\nextent Preferred\nSecurities allow\nholders to convert the\nPreferred Securities\ninto common stock of\nthe issuer, their\nmarket price can be\nsensitive to changes\nin the value of the\nissuer's common stock\nand, therefore,\ndeclining common stock\nvalues may also cause\nthe value of the\nFund's investments to\ndecline. Preferred\nsecurities often have\ncall features which\nallow the issuer to\nredeem the security at\nits discretion. The\nredemption of a\nPreferred Security\nhaving a higher than\naverage yield may\ncause a decrease in\nthe Fund's yield.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The\nvalues of debt\nsecurities may\nincrease or decrease\nas a result of the\nfollowing: market\nfluctuations, changes\nin interest rates,\nactual or perceived\ninability or\nunwillingness of\nissuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to\nmake scheduled\nprincipal or interest\npayments or\nilliquidity in debt\nsecurities markets;\nthe risk of low rates\nof return due to\nreinvestment of\nsecurities during\nperiods of falling\ninterest rates or\nrepayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or\ninterest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income\ndue to falling\ninterest rates. To the\nextent that interest\nrates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations\nmay be paid off\nsubstantially slower\nthan originally\nanticipated and the\nvalue of those\nsecurities may fall\nsharply. A rising\ninterest rate\nenvironment may cause\nthe value of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities to\ndecrease, an adverse\nimpact on the\nliquidity of the\nFund's fixed income\nsecurities, and\nincreased volatility\nof the fixed income\nmarkets. The current\nhistorically low\ninterest rate\nenvironment heightens\nthe risks associated\nwith rising interest\nrates. During periods\nwhen interest rates\nare at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be\nlow, and the Fund may\nhave a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose\nmoney on an operating\nbasis). If the\nprincipal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid\nbefore expected, the\nprepayments of\nprincipal may have to\nbe reinvested in\nobligations paying\ninterest at lower\nrates. During periods\nof falling interest\nrates, the income\nreceived by the Fund\nmay decline. Changes\nin interest rates will\nlikely have a greater\neffect on the values\nof debt securities of\nlonger durations.\nReturns on investments\nin debt securities\ncould trail the\nreturns on other\ninvestment options,\nincluding investments\nin equity securities.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\n18 Table of Contents\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those 19\n\nTable of Contents\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Unconstrained\nSector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a\nsubstantial portion of\nits assets within one\nor more economic\nsectors or industries,\nwhich may change from\ntime to time. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 8.71% (Q1,\n2019)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 10.03% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 1.13%.           \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\nEffective May 1, 2021 (the \u201cBenchmark Index\nChange Date\u201d), the Fund's benchmark index\nchanged from the Wells Fargo Hybrid and\nPreferred Securities Aggregate Index (the\n\u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the ICE\nExchange-Listed Fixed & Adjustable Rate\nPreferred Securities Index, consistent with a\nchange in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of the\ncurrent index. Performance of the Fund prior\nto the Benchmark Index Change Date is\ntherefore based on the Fund's investment\nstrategy to track the Previous Benchmark Index\nand may have been different had the Fund\ntracked the current index.\n                                              \n                      One     Five    Ten     \n                      Year    Years   Years   \n  Return Before       6.45%   5.55%   5.98%   \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After Taxes  4.63%   3.66%   3.94%   \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions    4.17%   3.66%   3.93%   \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  Wells Fargo Hybrid                          \n  and Preferred                               \n  Securities                                  \n  Aggregate Index     6.84%   5.89%   6.24%   \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for                               \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for       18.40%  15.22%  13.88%  \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.

She joined\nthe Adviser in 2010. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 18%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nMSCI USA Factor Mix\nA-Series Capped Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe equity market\nperformance of large-\nand mid-cap companies\nacross the U.S. equity\nmarket. It aims to\nrepresent the\nperformance of a\ncombination of three\nfactors: value,\nquality, and low\nvolatility. The Index\nis an equal weighted\ncombination of the\nfollowing three MSCI\nFactor Indices in a\nsingle composite\nindex: the MSCI USA\nValue Weighted Index,\nthe MSCI USA Quality\nIndex, and the MSCI\nUSA Minimum Volatility\nIndex (each, a\n\u201cComponent Index\u201d). If\nthe MSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Index is\nnot available due to\nthe concentrated\nnature of its\nunderlying parent\nindex (for example, in\nthe event of a low\nnumber of stocks or\nwhere a relatively few\nnumber of constituents\nconstitutes a large\nproportion of index\nweight), the MSCI USA\nMinimum Volatility\nIndex is replaced with\nthe MSCI USA Risk\nWeighted Index (if\nused to replace the\nMSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Index, also\na \u201cComponent Index\u201d)\nand the Index is an\nequal weighted\ncombination of the\nMSCI USA Value\nWeighted Index, the\nMSCI USA Quality Index\nand the MSCI USA Risk\nWeighted Index. The\nIndex Provider\n(defined below)\ndetermines if such\nreplacement is\nnecessary and reviews\nthe MSCI USA Minimum\nVolatility Index for\nviability on a regular\nbasis. The MSCI USA\nValue Weighted Index\nincludes publicly-\ntraded companies\ndomiciled in the U.S.,\nweighted to emphasize\nstocks with lower\nvaluations, by giving\nhigher index weight to\nstocks with higher\nvalues of fundamental\nvariables such as\nsales, earnings, cash\nearnings and book\nvalue. The MSCI USA\nQuality Index includes\npublicly-traded\ncompanies domiciled in\nthe U.S., weighted to\nemphasize stocks with\nhistorically high\nreturn on equity,\nstable year-over-year\nearnings growth, and\nlow financial\nleverage. The MSCI USA\nMinimum Volatility\nIndex aims to reflect\nthe performance\ncharacteristics of a\nminimum variance\nstrategy applied to\npublicly-traded\ncompanies domiciled in\nthe U.S. and is\nweighted to provide\nthe lowest absolute\nrisk within a given\nset of constraints.\nThe MSCI USA Risk\nWeighted Index\nincludes publicly-\ntraded companies\ndomiciled in the U.S.,\nand reweights the\nconstituents so that\nstocks with lower\nvolatility, measured\nas the weekly return\nvariance over the\nprior three years, are\ngiven higher index\nweight. Each Component\nIndex is attributed\nequal weight (1/3) at\neach rebalancing. All\nconstituents of each\nComponent Index are\nincluded in the Index.\nThe weight of each\nsecurity in the Index\nis determined based on\n1) the security's\nweight in each\nunderlying Component\nIndex; and 2) the\nweight of each\nunderlying Component\nIndex in the Index.\nThe Index is then\nsubject to the MSCI\nA-Series Index\nMethodology. The MSCI\nA-Series Index\nMethodology first\nseeks to ensure the\nIndex includes at\nleast 25 constituents.\nIn the event the Index\ndoes not contain at\nleast 25 constituents,\nthe Index is\nsupplemented by\nincluding constituents\nof the MSCI USA Small\nCap Index, selected in\ndecreasing order based\non full market\ncapitalization, until\nthe target of 25\nconstituents is\nreached. The MSCI\nA-Series Index\nMethodology then\napplies the MSCI 25/50\nIndex Methodology,\nwhich aims to reflect\n5/25/50 weight\nconstraints (i.e., no\nissuer has a weight\nabove 25%, and the sum\nof weights of all\nissuers with weights\nabove 5% does not\nexceed 50%). The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually, usually as\nof the close of the\nlast business day of\nMay and November,\ncoinciding with the\nsemi-annual index\nreviews of the MSCI\nGlobal Investable\nMarket Indices and of\neach Component Index.\nAs of July 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology and health\ncare sectors, although\nthis may change from\ntime to time. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 625\nsecurities. The Index\nis sponsored by MSCI,\nInc. (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with\nthe Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines\nthe composition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. 23\nTable of Contents\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nMid-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Health\nCare Sector Risk:\nCompanies in the\nhealth care sector are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernment regulation\nand their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of\nmedical products and\nservices, pricing\npressure (including\nprice discounting),\nlimited product lines\nand an increased\nemphasis on the\ndelivery of healthcare\nthrough outpatient\nservices. Companies in\nthe health care sector\nare heavily dependent\non obtaining and\ndefending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in\ntechnologies or other\nmarket developments.\nMany new products in\nthe health care sector\nrequire significant\nresearch and\ndevelopment and may be\nsubject to regulatory\napprovals, all of\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly\nwith no guarantee that\nany product will come\nto market. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or 24\nTable of Contents\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e., achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Low\nVolatility Risk:\nAlthough subject to\nthe risks of common\nstocks, low volatility\nstocks are seen as\nhaving a lower risk\nprofile than the\noverall markets.\nHowever, a portfolio\ncomprised of low\nvolatility stocks may\nnot produce investment\nexposure that has\nlower variability to\nchanges in such\nstocks' price levels.\nLow volatility stocks\nare likely to\nunderperform the\nbroader market during\nperiods of rapidly\nrising stock prices.\nNon-Diversification\nRisk: To the extent\nthe Fund becomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Quality\nRisk: A \u201cquality\u201d\nstyle of investing\nemphasizes companies\nwith high returns on\nequity, stable\nearnings per share\ngrowth, and low\nfinancial leverage.\nThis style of\ninvesting is subject\nto the risk that the\npast performance of\nthese companies does\nnot continue or that\nthe returns on\n\u201cquality\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. 25\n\nTable of Contents\nValue Stock Risk: A\n\u201cvalue\u201d style of\ninvesting is subject\nto the risk that the\nreturns on \u201cvalue\u201d\nequity securities are\nless than returns on\nother styles of\ninvesting or the\noverall stock market.\nValue stocks present\nthe risk that they may\ndecline in price or\nnever reach their\nexpected full market\nvalue because the\nmarket fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.\n\n26\n\nTable of Contents Individual Fund Shares may\nonly be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca,\nInc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 30% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the NYSE\nTechnology Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the\n\n28\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only to\nthe extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis composed of 35\nleading U.S.-listed\ntechnology-related\ncompanies. The\ninvestible universe of\nthe Index comprises all\nstocks in the\nTechnology sector and\ntechnology-related\nstocks in the Consumer\nDiscretionary sector,\nas defined by the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) that are listed\non major U.S. stock\nexchanges and meet the\nfollowing criteria as\nof the index rebalance\nreference date: (i)\nissued by a company\nwith a minimum market\ncapitalization of $2\nbillion and (ii) have a\ntrailing 3-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of $10 million.\nStocks must also meet\nat least one of the\nfollowing three\nrevenue- and sales-\nbased criteria: (i)\nsales from the latest\nquarter increased\ncompared to sales from\nthe same quarter of the\nprevious year, (ii)\nhave only one\nconsecutive quarter of\nnegative sales growth\nover the last two\nyears, or (iii) have\nrevenue totals from the\nlast four quarters that\nclassify it within the\ntop 75 companies within\nthe specific industry\nclassification\ndesignated to it by the\nIndex Provider.\nEligible stocks are\nthen ranked based on\nmarket capitalization\nand liquidity, and the\ntop 35 stocks are\nselected for inclusion\nin the Index. At least\n75% of the companies\nincluded in the Index\nmust be headquartered\nin the United States.\nThe Index is equal-\nweighted and rebalanced\nannually after the\nclose of trading on the\nthird Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021 the Index\ncomprised 35 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby ICE Data Indices,\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nTechnology Sector Risk:\nMarket or economic\nfactors impacting\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As with\nall exchange-traded\nfunds, Fund Shares may\nbe bought and sold in\nthe secondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so. 29\nTable of Contents\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily\non disposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. Also,\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on their\nrespective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the\nFund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a timely\nbasis. In addition, the\nFund, due to\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of tracking the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). 30\n\nTable of Contents Fund\nPerformance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective September 11, 2017, the\nFund's benchmark was renamed the NYSE\nTechnology Index due to a transfer of the\nIndex's management to ICE Data Indices, LLC.\nPrior to September 11, 2017, the Fund's\nbenchmark was named the Morgan Stanley\nTechnology Index.\n                                              \n                      One     Five    Ten     \n                      Year    Years   Years   \n  Return Before       73.75%  28.59%  19.66%  \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After Taxes  73.57%  26.80%  18.71%  \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions    43.71%  22.89%  16.48%  \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  NYSE Technology                             \n  Index (reflects no                          \n  deduction for       74.45%  29.27%  20.23%  \n  fees, expenses or                           \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for       18.40%  15.22%  13.88%  \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.

Kathleen\nMorgan, CFA, is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions Group. She joined\nthe Adviser in 2017. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n31\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.03%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 3% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index\n(including common\nstock, preferred stock,\ndepositary receipts and\nshares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\n\n33\n\nTable of Contents\nFund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only to\nthe extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\nlarge-, mid-, and\nsmall-capitalization\nsegments of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nIndex consists of those\nstocks included in the\nS&P 500 Index, the S&P\nMidCap 400 Index, and\nthe S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex. Each underlying\nindex includes U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE Arca,\nNYSE American, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX\nthat meet specific\nmarket capitalization\nrequirements. To be\nincluded in an\nunderlying index, a\nsecurity (or issuer of\na security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio of\n1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive aggregate\nearnings over the four\nmost recent quarters\nand for the most recent\nquarter. The Index is\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization\nweighted. Index\nconstituents are added\nand removed on an as-\nneeded basis. The Index\nis rebalanced on a\nquarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 1,506 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or 34\nTable of Contents\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the\nFund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a timely\nbasis. In addition, the\nFund, due to\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of tracking the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n35\n\nTable of Contents Fund\nPerformance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective July 9, 2013, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Dow Jones\nU.S. Total Stock Market Index to Russell 3000\nIndex. Effective November 16, 2017, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Russell 3000\nIndex to the SSGA Total Stock Market Index.\nEffective January 24, 2020, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the SSGA Total\nStock Market Index to the S&P Composite 1500\nIndex. Each benchmark index change was\nconsistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of a new index. Performance of the\nFund prior to January 24, 2020 is therefore\nbased on the Fund's investment strategy to\ntrack the applicable prior indexes and may\nhave been different had the Fund tracked the\ncurrent index.\n                                              \n                      One     Five    Ten     \n                      Year    Years   Years   \n  Return Before       17.87%  14.96%  13.48%  \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After Taxes  17.34%  14.42%  12.98%  \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions    10.83%  11.89%  11.17%  \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P Composite 1500                          \n  Index/SSGA Total                            \n  Stock Market                                \n  Index/Russell 3000                          \n  Index/Dow Jones                             \n  U.S. Total          18.04%  14.98%  13.59%  \n  Stock Market                                \n  Index1 (reflects                            \n  no deduction for                            \n  fees, expenses or                           \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for       18.40%  15.22%  13.88%  \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the S&P  \n     Composite 1500 Index for the period      \n     from January 24, 2020 to December 31,    \n     2020, the SSGA Total Stock Market Index  \n     for the period from November 16, 2017    \n     to January 23, 2020, the Russell 3000    \n     Index for the period from July 9, 2013   \n     to November 15, 2017, and the Dow Jones  \n     U.S. Total Stock Market Index for        \n  1  periods prior to July 9, 2013.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n37\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aePortfolio S&P 400 Mid Cap ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P 400 Mid Cap ETF      \n  (the                                        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment         \n  results that,                               \n  before fees and expenses, correspond        \n  generally to                                \n  the total return performance of an index    \n  that                                        \n  tracks the performance of                   \n  mid-capitalization                          \n  exchange traded U.S. equity securities.     \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.05%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.05%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $5         $16     $28      $64  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 14%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nMidCap 400 Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n38\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\nmid-capitalization\nsegment of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nselection universe for\nthe Index includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX with unadjusted\nmarket capitalizations\nbetween $3.6 billion\nand $13.1 billion and\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $1.8 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThese capitalization\nranges may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive\naggregate earnings\nover the four most\nrecent quarters and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. In selecting\nsecurities for\ninclusion in the\nIndex, the Index\nProvider also\nconsiders sector\nbalance by comparing\nthe weight of each\nGICS (Global Industry\nClassification\nStandard) sector in\nthe Index to its\nweight in the relevant\nmarket capitalization\nrange of the S&P Total\nMarket Index. The\nIndex is float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization\nweighted. Index\nconstituents are added\nand removed on an as-\nneeded basis. The\nIndex is rebalanced on\na quarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nindustrial sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 400 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines. 39\nTable of Contents\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). 40\n\nTable of Contents\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 24.31% (Q4,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 29.75% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 15.47%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes. Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective July 9, 2013, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Dow Jones\nU.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index to the\nRussell Small Cap Completeness Index.\nEffective August 31, 2016, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Russell Small\nCap Completeness Index to the S&P 1000 Index.\nEffective January 24, 2020, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the S&P 1000\nIndex to the S&P MidCap 400 Index. Each\nbenchmark index change was consistent with a\nchange in the Fund's principal investment\nstrategy to track the performance of a new\nindex. Performance of the Fund prior to\nJanuary 24, 2020 is therefore based on the\nFund's investment strategy to track the\napplicable prior indexes and may have been\ndifferent had the Fund tracked the current\nindex.\n                                              \n                      One     Five    Ten     \n                      Year    Years   Years   \n  Return Before       13.43%  11.64%  11.16%  \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After Taxes  12.92%  11.02%  10.07%  \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions    8.08%   9.05%   8.77%   \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P MidCap 400                              \n  Index/S&P 1000                              \n  Index/Russell                               \n  Small                                       \n  Cap Completeness                            \n  Index/Dow Jones     13.61%  11.70%  11.30%  \n  U.S. Mid-Cap                                \n  Total Stock Market                          \n  Index1 (reflects                            \n  no deduction                                \n  for fees, expenses                          \n  or taxes)                                   \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for       18.40%  15.22%  13.88%  \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the S&P  \n     MidCap 400 Index for the period January  \n     24, 2020 to December 31, 2020, the S&P   \n     1000 Index for the period from August    \n     31, 2016 to January 23, 2020, the        \n     Russell Small Cap Completeness Index     \n     for the period from July 9, 2013 to      \n     August 30, 2016, and the Dow Jones U.S.  \n     Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index for     \n  1  periods prior to July 9, 2013.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n41\n\nTable of Contents Portfolio Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Michael Feehily, Karl Schneider\nand Mark Krivitsky. Michael Feehily, CFA, is a\nSenior Managing Director of the Adviser and\nthe Head of Global Equity Beta Solutions in\nthe Americas. He worked at the Adviser from\n1997 to 2006 and rejoined in 2010. Karl\nSchneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the\nAdviser and Deputy Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He joined the\nAdviser in 1997. Mark Krivitsky is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group and the Tax-Efficient Market\nCapture Group. He joined the Adviser in 1996.\nPurchase and Sale Information The Fund will\nissue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n42\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aePortfolio S&P 500 \u00aeETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (the         \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks                               \n  to provide investment results that, before  \n  fees                                        \n  and expenses, correspond generally to the   \n  total                                       \n  return performance of an index that tracks  \n  the                                         \n  performance of large capitalization         \n  exchange                                    \n  traded U.S. equity securities.              \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.03%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $3         $10     $17      $39  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 4% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n500 Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index\n(including common\nstock, preferred stock,\ndepositary receipts and\nshares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\n\n43\n\nTable of Contents\nFund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only to\nthe extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\nlarge-capitalization\nsegment of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nselection universe for\nthe Index includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nCapital Market, Cboe\nBZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe\nEDGA, or Cboe EDGX with\nunadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $13.1 billion and\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $6.55 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThese capitalization\nranges may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio of\n1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive aggregate\nearnings over the four\nmost recent quarters\nand for the most recent\nquarter. In selecting\nsecurities for\ninclusion in the Index,\nthe Index Provider also\nconsiders sector\nbalance by comparing\nthe weight of each GICS\n(Global Industry\nClassification\nStandard) sector in the\nIndex to its weight in\nthe relevant market\ncapitalization range of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex. The Index is\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization\nweighted. Index\nconstituents are added\nand removed on an as-\nneeded basis. The Index\nis rebalanced on a\nquarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fundcomprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 505 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain 44 Table of\nContents on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the\nFund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a timely\nbasis. In addition, the\nFund, due to\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of tracking the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n45\n\nTable of Contents Fund\nPerformance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective July 9, 2013, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Dow Jones\nU.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index to the\nRussell 1000 Index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.04%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.04%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $4         $13     $23      $51  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 11%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n500 Growth Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n48\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex measures the\nperformance of the\nlarge-capitalization\ngrowth segment of the\nU.S. equity market.\nThe Index consists of\nthose stocks in the\nS&P 500 Index\nexhibiting the\nstrongest growth\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) sales growth;\n(ii) changes in\nearnings overprice;\nand (iii) momentum.\nThe S&P 500 Index\nfocuses on the large\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity market,\nincluding common stock\nand real estate\ninvestment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d). The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P 500 Index\nincludes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American,\nNASDAQ Global Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX with\nunadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $13.1 billion\nand float-adjusted\nmarket capitalizations\nof at least $6.55\nbillion at the time of\ninclusion. The minimum\nrequired\ncapitalization may be\nrevised by the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) at any time. To\nbe included in the\nIndex, a security (or\nissuer of a security,\nas applicable) should\n(i) have an annual\ndollar value traded to\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the\nsum of earnings over\nthose quarters) and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. Meeting these\ncriteria does not\nguarantee automatic\ninclusion into the\nIndex. Given the\nlimited number of\ncompanies that the\nIndex can have and\nthat it must reflect\nsector representation,\nsome eligible\ncompanies may not be\nadded to the Index at\na particular time. S&P\nDow Jones Indices\nLLC's Index Committee\nmakes the final\ndetermination and\napproval of all Index\nconstituents. The\nIndex is market\ncapitalization\nweighted and\nrebalanced annually on\nthe third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology,\ncommunications\nservices and consumer\ndiscretionary sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 239 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Growth Stock\nRisk: The prices of\ngrowth stocks may be\nbased largely on\nexpectations of future\nearnings, and their\nprices can decline\nrapidly and\nsignificantly in\nreaction to negative\nnews. Growth stocks\nmay underperform value\nstocks and stocks in\nother broad style\ncategories (and the\nstock market as a\nwhole) over any period\nof time and may shift\nin and out of favor\nwith investors\ngenerally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on\nchanges in market,\neconomic, and other\nfactors. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times 49 Table\nof Contents when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCommunication Services\nSector Risk:\nCommunication services\ncompanies are\nparticularly\nvulnerable to the\npotential obsolescence\nof products and\nservices due to\ntechnological\nadvancement and the\ninnovation of\ncompetitors. Companies\nin the communication\nservices sector may\nalso be affected by\nother competitive\npressures, such as\npricing competition,\nas well as research\nand development costs,\nsubstantial capital\nrequirements and\ngovernment regulation.\nAdditionally,\nfluctuating domestic\nand international\ndemand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes\nin consumer tastes can\ndrastically affect a\ncommunication services\ncompany's\nprofitability. While\nall companies may be\nsusceptible to network\nsecurity breaches,\ncertain companies in\nthe communication\nservices sector may be\nparticular targets of\nhacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary\nor consumer\ninformation or\ndisruptions in\nservice, which could\nhave a material\nadverse effect on\ntheir businesses.\nConsumer Discretionary\nSector Risk: The\nsuccess of consumer\nproduct manufacturers\nand retailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. 50\n\nTable of Contents Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

He\nworked at the Adviser from 1997 to 2006 and\nrejoined in 2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a\nManaging Director of the Adviser and Deputy\nHead of Global Equity Beta Solutions in the\nAmericas. He joined the Adviser in 1997. Mark\nKrivitsky is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Global\nEquity Beta Solutions Group and the Tax-\nEfficient Market Capture Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 1996. Purchase and Sale Information\nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.07%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.07%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $7         $23     $40      $90  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 39% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n500 High Dividend Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the\n\n53\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only to\nthe extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of 80\nhigh dividend-yielding\ncompanies within the\nS&P 500 \u00aeIndex. The S&P\n500 Index focuses on\nthe large\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity market,\nincluding common stock\nand real estate\ninvestment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d). The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P 500 Index\nincludes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE Arca,\nNYSE American, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX\nwith unadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $13.1 billion and\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $6.55 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThe minimum required\ncapitalization may be\nrevised by the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) at any time. To\ndetermine dividend\nyield: (i) an indicated\ndividend is measured by\ntaking the latest\ndividend paid\n(excluding special\npayments) multiplied by\nthe annual frequency of\nthe payment; and (ii)\nthe indicated dividend\nis then divided by the\ncompany's share price\nas of the rebalancing\nreference date. Index\nconstituents are\nequally weighted and\nthe Index is rebalanced\nsemi-annually, in\nJanuary and July. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial, utilities\nand real estate\nsectors, although this\nmay change from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 77 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nDividend Paying\nSecurities Risk:\nSecurities that pay\ndividends, as a group,\ncan fall out of favor\nwith the market,\ncausing such companies\nto underperform\ncompanies that do not\npay dividends. In\naddition, changes in\nthe dividend policies\nof the companies held\nby the Fund or the\ncapital resources\navailable for such\ncompany's dividend\npayments may adversely\naffect the Fund. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. 54 Table of\nContents Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the\nFund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a timely\nbasis. In addition, the\nFund, due to\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more 55 Table\nof Contents diversified\nfunds. The Fund may\nbecome non-diversified\nfor periods of time\nsolely as a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Real\nEstate Sector Risk: An\ninvestment in a real\nproperty company may be\nsubject to risks\nsimilar to those\nassociated with direct\nownership of real\nestate, including, by\nway of example, the\npossibility of declines\nin the value of real\nestate, losses from\ncasualty or\ncondemnation, and\nchanges in local and\ngeneral economic\nconditions, supply and\ndemand, interest rates,\nenvironmental\nliability, zoning laws,\nregulatory limitations\non rents, property\ntaxes, and operating\nexpenses. Some real\nproperty companies have\nlimited diversification\nbecause they invest in\na limited number of\nproperties, a narrow\ngeographic area, or a\nsingle type of\nproperty. REIT Risk:\nReal estate investment\ntrusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) are\nsubject to the risks\nassociated with\ninvesting in the\nsecurities of real\nproperty companies. In\nparticular, REITs may\nbe affected by changes\nin the values of the\nunderlying properties\nthat they own or\noperate. Further, REITs\nare dependent upon\nspecialized management\nskills, and their\ninvestments may be\nconcentrated in\nrelatively few\nproperties, or in a\nsmall geographic area\nor a single property\ntype. REITs are also\nsubject to heavy cash\nflow dependency and, as\na result, are\nparticularly reliant on\nthe proper functioning\nof capital markets. A\nvariety of economic and\nother factors may\nadversely affect a\nlessee's ability to\nmeet its obligations to\na REIT. In the event of\na default by a lessee,\nthe REIT may experience\ndelays in enforcing its\nrights as a lessor and\nmay incur substantial\ncosts associated in\nprotecting its\ninvestments. In\naddition, a REIT could\nfail to qualify for\nfavorable regulatory\ntreatment.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\nUtilities Sector Risk:\nUtility companies are\naffected by supply and\ndemand, operating\ncosts, government\nregulation,\nenvironmental factors,\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities, and rate\ncaps or rate changes.\nAlthough rate changes\nof a utility usually\nfluctuate in\napproximate correlation\nwith financing costs,\ndue to political and\nregulatory factors rate\nchanges ordinarily\noccur only following a\ndelay after the changes\nin financing costs.\nThis factor will tend\nto favorably affect a\nregulated utility\ncompany's earnings and\ndividends in times of\ndecreasing costs, but\nconversely, will tend\nto adversely affect\nearnings and dividends\nwhen costs are rising.\nThe value of regulated\nutility debt securities\n(and, to a lesser\nextent, equity\nsecurities) may tend to\nhave an inverse\nrelationship to the\nmovement of interest\nrates. Certain utility\ncompanies have\nexperienced full or\npartial deregulation in\nrecent years. These\nutility companies are\nfrequently more similar\nto industrial companies\nin that they are\nsubject to greater\ncompetition and have\nbeen permitted by\nregulators to diversify\noutside of their\noriginal geographic\nregions and their\ntraditional lines of\nbusiness. These\nopportunities may\npermit certain utility\ncompanies to earn more\nthan their traditional\nregulated rates of\nreturn. Some companies,\nhowever, may be forced\nto defend their core\nbusiness and may be\nless profitable. In\naddition, natural\ndisasters, terrorist\nattacks, government\nintervention or other\nfactors may render a\nutility company's\nequipment unusable or\nobsolete and negatively\nimpact profitability.\nAmong the risks that\nmay affect utility\ncompanies are the\nfollowing: risks of\nincreases in fuel and\nother operating costs;\nthe high cost of\nborrowing to finance\ncapital construction\nduring inflationary\nperiods; restrictions\non operations and\nincreased costs and\ndelays associated with\ncompliance with\nenvironmental and\nnuclear safety\nregulations; and the\ndifficulties involved\nin obtaining natural\ngas for resale or fuel\nfor generating\nelectricity at\nreasonable prices.\nOther risks include\nthose related to the\nconstruction and\noperation of nuclear\npower plants, the\neffects of energy\nconservation and the\neffects of regulatory\nchanges. 56\n\nTable of Contents Fund\nPerformance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and John Law. Michael Feehily,\nCFA, is a Senior Managing Director of the\nAdviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. John Law, CFA,\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2016. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n57\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $4         $13     $23      $51  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 18%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n500 Value Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n59\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nmeasures the\nperformance of the\nlarge-capitalization\nvalue segment of the\nU.S. equity market.\nThe Index consists of\nthose stocks in the\nS&P 500 Index\nexhibiting the\nstrongest value\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) book value to\nprice ratio; (ii)\nearnings to price\nratio; and (iii) sales\nto price ratio. The\nS&P 500 Index focuses\non the large\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity market,\nincluding common stock\nand real estate\ninvestment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d). The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P 500 Index\nincludes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American,\nNASDAQ Global Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX with\nunadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $13.1 billion\nand float-adjusted\nmarket capitalizations\nof at least $6.55\nbillion at the time of\ninclusion. The minimum\nrequired\ncapitalization may be\nrevised by the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) at any time. To\nbe included in the\nIndex, a security (or\nissuer of a security,\nas applicable) should\n(i) have an annual\ndollar value traded to\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the\nsum of earnings over\nthose quarters) and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. Meeting these\ncriteria does not\nguarantee automatic\ninclusion into the\nIndex. Given the\nlimited number of\ncompanies that the\nIndex can have and\nthat it must reflect\nsector representation,\nsome eligible\ncompanies may not be\nadded to the Index at\na particular time. S&P\nDow Jones Indices\nLLC's Index Committee\nmakes the final\ndetermination and\napproval of all Index\nconstituents. The\nIndex is market\ncapitalization\nweighted and\nrebalanced annually on\nthe third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial and health\ncare sectors, although\nthis may change from\ntime to time. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 433\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Value Stock\nRisk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style\nof investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times 60 Table\nof Contents when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Health Care\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the health care\nsector are subject to\nextensive government\nregulation and their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of\nmedical products and\nservices, pricing\npressure (including\nprice discounting),\nlimited product lines\nand an increased\nemphasis on the\ndelivery of healthcare\nthrough outpatient\nservices. Companies in\nthe health care sector\nare heavily dependent\non obtaining and\ndefending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in\ntechnologies or other\nmarket developments.\nMany new products in\nthe health care sector\nrequire significant\nresearch and\ndevelopment and may be\nsubject to regulatory\napprovals, all of\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly\nwith no guarantee that\nany product will come\nto market. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully 61\n\nTable of Contents\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 14.45% (Q4,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 25.31% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 15.25%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

Purchase and Sale Information\nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n63\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aePortfolio S&P 600 Small Cap ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap ETF    \n  (the                                        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment         \n  results that,                               \n  before fees and expenses, correspond        \n  generally to                                \n  the total return performance of an index    \n  that                                        \n  tracks the performance of small             \n  capitalization                              \n  exchange traded U.S. equity securities.     \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $5         $16     $28      $64  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 13%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n64\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nmeasures the\nperformance of the\nsmall-capitalization\nsegment of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nselection universe for\nthe Index includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX with unadjusted\nmarket capitalizations\nbetween $850 million\nand $3.6 billion and\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $425 million at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThese capitalization\nranges may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive\naggregate earnings\nover the four most\nrecent quarters and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. In selecting\nsecurities for\ninclusion in the\nIndex, the Index\nProvider also\nconsiders sector\nbalance by comparing\nthe weight of each\nGICS (Global Industry\nClassification\nStandard) sector in\nthe Index to its\nweight in the relevant\nmarket capitalization\nrange of the S&P Total\nMarket Index. The\nIndex is float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization\nweighted. Index\nconstituents are added\nand removed on an as-\nneeded basis. The\nIndex is rebalanced on\na quarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial and\nindustrial sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 602 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines. 65\nTable of Contents\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\n66\n\nTable of Contents to\ncontrol the U.S. (and\nother) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 31.29% (Q4,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 32.74% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 20.01%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective November 16, 2017, the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the Russell 2000\nIndex to the SSGA Small Cap Index. Effective\nJanuary 24, 2020, the Fund's benchmark index\nchanged from the SSGA Small Cap Index to the\nS&P SmallCap 600 Index. Each benchmark index\nchange was 67\n\nTable of Contents\n\nconsistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of a new index.

Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Teddy Wong is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2001. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n68\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeRussell 1000 \u00aeLow Volatility Focus ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus  \n  ETF                                         \n  (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment    \n  results                                     \n  that, before fees and expenses, correspond  \n  generally to the total return performance   \n  of the                                      \n  Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor  \n  Index.                                      \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 31%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nRussell 1000 Low\nVolatility Focused\nFactor Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index (including\ncommon stock,\npreferred stock,\ndepositary receipts\nand shares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the\n\n69\n\nTable of Contents\nFund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to reflect\nthe performance of a\nsegment of large-\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity securities\ndemonstrating a\ncombination of core\nfactors (high value,\nhigh quality, and low\nsize characteristics),\nwith a focus factor\ncomprising low\nvolatility\ncharacteristics (the\n\u201cFactor\nCharacteristics\u201d). To\nconstruct the Index,\nFrank Russell Company\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d)\nutilizes a rules-based\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess that seeks to\nincrease exposure (or\n\u201ctilt\u201d) to companies\nin the Russell 1000\nIndex demonstrating\nthe Factor\nCharacteristics. The\nRussell 1000 Index is\na market-\ncapitalization index\nthat measures the\nperformance of the\nlarge-cap segment of\nthe U.S. equity\nuniverse. Within the\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess, a specific\nfocus is applied\ntowards a company's\nvolatility factor.\nVolatility is a\nstatistical\nmeasurement of the\nmagnitude of movements\nin a stock's price\nover time. Each\nstock's factor scores\nare multiplied by the\nstock's free float\nmarket cap weight in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nto determine each\nconstituent's weight\nin the multi-factor\nIndex. Companies in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nare excluded from the\nIndex if they do not\nmeet a minimum weight\nin the Index. A\ncompany's volatility\nfactor score is based\non the standard\ndeviation of weekly\ntotal returns to a\ncompany's stock price\nover the trailing five\nyears ending on the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nvalue factor score is\nbased on cash flow\nyield, earnings yield,\nand country relative\nsales to price ratio,\ncalculated based on\nthe company's total\nmarket capitalization\nand information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nquality factor score\nis based on return on\nassets, change in\nasset turnover,\naccruals, and\nleverage, calculated\nbased on information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nsize factor score is\nbased on total market\ncapitalization as of\nthe last business day\nof the month prior to\nthe Index rebalancing\nmonth. The weight of\neach individual stock\nin the Index is capped\nat 2000% of the\nstock's weight in the\nRussell 1000 Index,\nand any weight\nexceeding this limit\nwill be redistributed\nto all stocks below\nthe limit in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nweight of each\nindustry in the Index\nis capped at 120% of\nthe industry's weight\nin the Russell 1000\nIndex plus an\nadditional 5%, and any\nweight exceeding this\nlimit is redistributed\nto all other\nindustries below the\nlimit in proportion to\ntheir combination of\nmarket capitalization\nand factor scoring.\nThe weight of each\nindustry in the Index\nmust be at least 80%\nof the industry's\nweight in the Russell\n1000 Index less 5%.\nThe weights of any\nindustries below this\nminimum will be\nincreased to the\nminimum by\nredistributing the\nweights of industries\nabove the minimum in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nannually in June. As\nof July 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nindustrial and\ntechnology sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021 there were\napproximately 435\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by the Index\nProvider, which is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. 70 Table of\nContents Low\nVolatility Risk:\nAlthough subject to\nthe risks of common\nstocks, low volatility\nstocks are seen as\nhaving a lower risk\nprofile than the\noverall markets.\nHowever, a portfolio\ncomprised of low\nvolatility stocks may\nnot produce investment\nexposure that has\nlower variability to\nchanges in such\nstocks' price levels.\nLow volatility stocks\nare likely to\nunderperform the\nbroader market during\nperiods of rapidly\nrising stock prices.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, 71\n\nTable of Contents\nproduct, financial, or\nother market\nconditions. Larger\ncompanies may not be\nable to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Quality\nRisk: A \u201cquality\u201d\nstyle of investing\nemphasizes companies\nwith high returns on\nequity, stable\nearnings per share\ngrowth, and low\nfinancial leverage.\nThis style of\ninvesting is subject\nto the risk that the\npast performance of\nthese companies does\nnot continue or that\nthe returns on\n\u201cquality\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Value\nStock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d\nstyle of investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                              \n                One     Five    Since         \n                Year    Years   Inception     \n                                (12/02/15)    \n  Return        6.39%   12.53%  11.98%        \n  Before Taxes                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on      5.81%   11.39%  10.84%        \n  Distributio\u2026                                \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributio\u2026  4.04%   9.59%   9.14%         \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  Russell 1000                                \n  Low                                         \n  Volatility                                  \n  Focused                                     \n  Factor Index  6.61%   12.79%  12.24%        \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction                                   \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500                                     \n  Index                                       \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction     18.40%  15.22%  14.61%        \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.

Purchase\nand Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other\nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation\nUnit transactions are conducted in exchange\nfor the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased\nand sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.20%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.20%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 42% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nRussell 1000 Momentum\nFocused Factor Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index\n(including common\nstock, preferred stock,\ndepositary receipts and\nshares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\n\n74\n\nTable of Contents\nFund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only to\nthe extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to reflect\nthe performance of a\nsegment of large-\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity securities\ndemonstrating a\ncombination of core\nfactors (high value,\nhigh quality, and low\nsize characteristics),\nwith a focus factor\ncomprising high\nmomentum\ncharacteristics (the\n\u201cFactor\nCharacteristics\u201d). To\nconstruct the Index,\nFrank Russell Company\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d)\nutilizes a rules-based\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess that seeks to\nincrease exposure (or\n\u201ctilt\u201d) to companies in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\ndemonstrating the\nFactor Characteristics.\nThe Russell 1000 Index\nis a market-\ncapitalization index\nthat measures the\nperformance of the\nlarge-cap segment of\nthe U.S. equity\nuniverse. Within the\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess, a specific\nfocus is applied\ntowards a company's\nmomentum factor.\nCompanies with higher\nmomentum are those\nwhose securities have\nhad higher recent price\nperformance compared to\nother securities. Each\nstock's factor scores\nare multiplied by the\nstock's free float\nmarket cap weight in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nto determine each\nconstituent's weight in\nthe multi-factor Index.\nCompanies in the\nRussell 1000 Index are\nexcluded from the Index\nif they do not meet a\nminimum weight in the\nIndex. A company's\nmomentum factor score\nis based on historical\ntotal return over the\n11 months ending on the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nvalue factor score is\nbased on cash flow\nyield, earnings yield,\nand country relative\nsales to price ratio,\ncalculated based on the\ncompany's total market\ncapitalization and\ninformation reported in\nthe company's most\nrecent annual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nquality factor score is\nbased on return on\nassets, change in asset\nturnover, accruals, and\nleverage, calculated\nbased on information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's size\nfactor score is based\non total market\ncapitalization as of\nthe last business day\nof the month prior to\nthe Index rebalancing\nmonth. The weight of\neach individual stock\nin the Index is capped\nat 2000% of the stock's\nweight in the Russell\n1000 Index, and any\nweight exceeding this\nlimit will be\nredistributed to all\nstocks below the limit\nin proportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nweight of each industry\nin the Index is capped\nat 120% of the\nindustry's weight in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nplus an additional 5%,\nand any weight\nexceeding this limit is\nredistributed to all\nother industries below\nthe limit in proportion\nto their combination of\nmarket capitalization\nand factor scoring. The\nweight of each industry\nin the Index must be at\nleast 80% of the\nindustry's weight in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nless 5%. The weights of\nany industries below\nthis minimum will be\nincreased to the\nminimum by\nredistributing the\nweights of industries\nabove the minimum in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nsemi-annually in June\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary,\nindustrial and\ntechnology sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021 there were\napproximately 907\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by the Index\nProvider, which is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. 75\nTable of Contents\nMomentum Risk: The Fund\nemploys a \u201cmomentum\u201d\nstyle of investing that\nemphasizes investing in\nsecurities that have\nhad higher recent price\nperformance compared to\nother securities. This\nstyle of investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat these securities\nmay be more volatile\nthan a broad cross-\nsection of securities\nor that the returns on\nsecurities that have\npreviously exhibited\nprice momentum are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Momentum can\nturn quickly and cause\nsignificant variation\nfrom other types of\ninvestments.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector\nRisk: The success of\nconsumer product\nmanufacturers and\nretailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily\non disposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. Also,\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on their\nrespective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\n76 Table of Contents to\ncontrol the U.S. (and\nother) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable\nto respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-\nsized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to maintain\ngrowth at the high\nrates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the\nFund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a timely\nbasis. In addition, the\nFund, due to\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of tracking the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Quality\nRisk: A \u201cquality\u201d style\nof investing emphasizes\ncompanies with high\nreturns on equity,\nstable earnings per\nshare growth, and low\nfinancial leverage.\nThis style of investing\nis subject to the risk\nthat the past\nperformance of these\ncompanies does not\ncontinue or that the\nreturns on \u201cquality\u201d\nequity securities are\nless than returns on\nother styles of\ninvesting or the\noverall stock market.\nTechnology Sector Risk:\nMarket or economic\nfactors impacting\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\nValue Stock Risk: A\n\u201cvalue\u201d style of\ninvesting is subject to\nthe risk that the\nreturns on \u201cvalue\u201d\nequity securities are\nless than returns on\nother styles of\ninvesting or the\noverall stock market.\nValue stocks present\nthe risk that they may\ndecline in price or\nnever reach their\nexpected full market\nvalue because the\nmarket fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth. 77\n\nTable of Contents Fund\nPerformance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

He joined the Adviser in 2006. Purchase\nand Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other\nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation\nUnit transactions are conducted in exchange\nfor the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased\nand sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary\n\n78\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 58%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nRussell 1000 Yield\nFocused Factor Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index (including\ncommon stock,\npreferred stock,\ndepositary receipts\nand shares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the\n\n80\n\nTable of Contents\nFund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to reflect\nthe performance of a\nsegment of large-\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity securities\ndemonstrating a\ncombination of core\nfactors (high value,\nhigh quality, and low\nsize characteristics),\nwith a focus factor\ncomprising high yield\ncharacteristics (the\n\u201cFactor\nCharacteristics\u201d). To\nconstruct the Index,\nFrank Russell Company\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d)\nutilizes a rules-based\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess that seeks to\nincrease exposure (or\n\u201ctilt\u201d) to companies\nin the Russell 1000\nIndex demonstrating\nthe Factor\nCharacteristics. The\nRussell 1000 Index is\na market-\ncapitalization index\nthat measures the\nperformance of the\nlarge-cap segment of\nthe U.S. equity\nuniverse. Within the\nmulti-factor scoring\nprocess, a specific\nfocus is applied\ntowards a company's\nyield factor.\nCompanies with higher\nyield are those whose\nsecurities have paid\nhigher dividends\ncompared to other\nsecurities. Each\nstock's factor scores\nare multiplied by the\nstock's free float\nmarket cap weight in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nto determine each\nconstituent's weight\nin the multi-factor\nIndex. Companies in\nthe Russell 1000 Index\nare excluded from the\nIndex if they do not\nmeet a minimum weight\nin the Index. A\ncompany's yield factor\nscore is based on\n12-month trailing\ndividend yield as of\nthe last business day\nof the month prior to\nthe Index rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nvalue factor score is\nbased on cash flow\nyield, earnings yield,\nand country relative\nsales to price ratio,\ncalculated based on\nthe company's total\nmarket capitalization\nand information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nquality factor score\nis based on return on\nassets, change in\nasset turnover,\naccruals, and\nleverage, calculated\nbased on information\nreported in the\ncompany's most recent\nannual financial\nstatement as of the\nlast business day of\nthe month prior to the\nIndex rebalancing\nmonth. A company's\nsize factor score is\nbased on the log of\nthe total market\ncapitalization as of\nthe last business day\nof the month prior to\nthe Index rebalancing\nmonth. The weight of\neach individual stock\nin the Index is capped\nat 2000% of the\nstock's weight in the\nRussell 1000 Index,\nand any weight\nexceeding this limit\nwill be redistributed\nto all stocks below\nthe limit in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nweight of each\nindustry in the Index\nis capped at 120% of\nthe industry's weight\nin the Russell 1000\nIndex plus an\nadditional 5%, and any\nweight exceeding this\nlimit is redistributed\nto all other\nindustries below the\nlimit in proportion to\ntheir combination of\nmarket capitalization\nand factor scoring.\nThe weight of each\nindustry in the Index\nmust be at least 80%\nof the industry's\nweight in the Russell\n1000 Index less 5%.\nThe weights of any\nindustries below this\nminimum will be\nincreased to the\nminimum by\nredistributing the\nweights of industries\nabove the minimum in\nproportion to their\ncombination of market\ncapitalization and\nfactor scoring. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nannually in June. As\nof July 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, there were\napproximately 277\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by the Index\nProvider, which is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. 81 Table of\nContents Dividend\nPaying Securities\nRisk: Securities that\npay dividends, as a\ngroup, can fall out of\nfavor with the market,\ncausing such companies\nto underperform\ncompanies that do not\npay dividends. In\naddition, changes in\nthe dividend policies\nof the companies held\nby the Fund or the\ncapital resources\navailable for such\ncompany's dividend\npayments may adversely\naffect the Fund.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 82\n\nTable of Contents\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Quality\nRisk: A \u201cquality\u201d\nstyle of investing\nemphasizes companies\nwith high returns on\nequity, stable\nearnings per share\ngrowth, and low\nfinancial leverage.\nThis style of\ninvesting is subject\nto the risk that the\npast performance of\nthese companies does\nnot continue or that\nthe returns on\n\u201cquality\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Unconstrained\nSector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a\nsubstantial portion of\nits assets within one\nor more economic\nsectors or industries,\nwhich may change from\ntime to time. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly. Value\nStock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d\nstyle of investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and John Law. Michael Feehily,\nCFA, is a Senior Managing Director of the\nAdviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. John Law, CFA,\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2016. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 53%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n1500 Positive Momentum\nTilt Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n85\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex applies an\nalternative weighting\nmethodology to the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index\nso that stocks with\nrelatively strong\nmomentum are\noverweight relative to\nthe S&P Composite 1500\nIndex and stocks with\nrelatively weak\nmomentum are\nunderweight. The S&P\nComposite 1500 Index,\none of the leading\nindices of the U.S.\nequity market, is a\ncapitalization-\nweighted combination\nof the large-cap S&P\n500 Index, the S&P\nMidCap 400 Index, and\nthe S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex. A \u201cmomentum\u201d\nstyle of investing\nemphasizes investing\nin securities that\nhave had higher recent\nprice performance\ncompared to other\nsecurities. In\nconstructing the\nIndex, the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) estimates the\nmomentum of each stock\nin the S&P Composite\n1500 Index based on\nits 11-month total\nreturn ending on the\nrebalancing reference\ndate and ranks all\n1,500 Index\nconstituents in order\nof momentum. S&P then\nforms 20 sub-\nportfolios of\napproximately equal\nmarket capitalization,\ngrouped by momentum.\nS&P determines each\nsub-portfolio\nallocation so that a\nsub-portfolio with\nrelatively high\nmomentum will have a\nhigher allocation than\na sub-portfolio with\nrelatively low\nmomentum. The weight\nof each stock in the\nIndex is proportional\nto its market\ncapitalization and to\nits sub-portfolio\nallocation. The Index\nis rebalanced\nquarterly, effective\nafter the close on the\nthird Friday of\nJanuary, April, July,\nand October. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology and\nfinancial sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, there were\napproximately 1,503\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Momentum Risk:\nThe Fund employs a\n\u201cmomentum\u201d style of\ninvesting that\nemphasizes investing\nin securities that\nhave had higher recent\nprice performance\ncompared to other\nsecurities. This style\nof investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat these securities\nmay be more volatile\nthan a broad cross-\nsection of securities\nor that the returns on\nsecurities that have\npreviously exhibited\nprice momentum are\nless than returns on\nother styles of\ninvesting or the\noverall stock market.\nMomentum can turn\nquickly and cause\nsignificant variation\nfrom other types of\ninvestments.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty. 86\nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\n87\n\nTable of Contents\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n89\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 1500 Value Tilt ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 1500 Value Tilt ETF (the       \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of an index that   \n  tracks                                      \n  the performance of U.S. equity securities   \n  exhibiting \u201cvalue\u201d characteristics.         \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.12%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.12%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 24% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n1500 Low Valuation Tilt\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal\nmarket conditions, the\nFund generally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the\nFund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only to\nthe extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n90\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex applies an\nalternative weighting\nmethodology to the S&P\nComposite 1500 Index so\nthat stocks with\nrelatively low\nvaluations ( i.e.,\nrelatively \u201ccheap\u201d) are\noverweight relative to\nthe S&P Composite 1500\nIndex and stocks with\nrelatively high\nvaluations ( i.e.,\nrelatively \u201crich\u201d) are\nunderweight. The S&P\nComposite 1500 Index,\none of the leading\nindices of the U.S.\nequity market, is a\ncapitalization-weighted\ncombination of the\nlarge-cap S&P 500\nIndex, the S&P MidCap\n400 Index, and the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index. In\nconstructing the Index,\nthe Index Provider (as\ndefined below)\nestimates the valuation\nof each stock in the S&\nP Composite 1500 Index\nbased on the ratio of\nits price to its\nreported book value and\nlast 12 months level of\nearnings, cash flow,\nsales, and dividends.\nS&P weights this data\nfrom the last five\ncalendar years to\ncreate a composite\nvaluation measure, and\nranks all 1,500 index\nconstituents in order\nof composite valuation.\nS&P then forms 20 sub-\nportfolios of\napproximately equal\nmarket capitalization,\ngrouped by composite\nvaluations. S&P derives\na sub-portfolio\nallocation factor using\neach sub-portfolio's\ncomposite valuation, so\nthat a sub-portfolio\nwith relatively low\nvaluation will have a\nhigher allocation\nfactor than a sub-\nportfolio with\nrelatively high\nvaluation. The weight\nof each stock in the\nIndex is proportionate\nto its market\ncapitalization and to\nits sub-portfolio\nallocation factor. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nannually after the\nclose of business on\nthe third Friday of\nApril. As of July 31,\n2021, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe financial sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, there were\napproximately 1,486\nsecurities in the\nIndex. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated\nwith the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Value\nStock Risk: A \u201cvalue\u201d\nstyle of investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a 91 Table of\nContents derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation\nwhich may limit both\nthe amounts and types\nof loans and other\nfinancial commitments\nthey can make, the\ninterest rates and fees\nthey can charge, the\nscope of their\nactivities, the prices\nthey can charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition, deterioration\nof the credit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of markets,\nincluding U.S. and\ninternational credit\nand interbank money\nmarkets generally,\nthereby affecting a\nwide range of financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain events\nin the financial sector\nmay cause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets, both\ndomestic and foreign,\nand cause certain\nfinancial services\ncompanies to incur\nlarge losses.\nSecurities of financial\nservices companies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or\ncease operations.\nCredit losses resulting\nfrom financial\ndifficulties of\nborrowers and financial\nlosses associated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse\neconomic, business or\npolitical developments\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected to\nthe value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the\nFund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a timely\nbasis. In addition, the\nFund, due to\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may hold\na smaller number of\nportfolio securities\nthan many other funds.\nTo the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively\nsmall number of\nissuers, a decline in\nthe market value of a\nparticular security\nheld by the Fund may\naffect its value more\nthan if it invested in\na larger number of\nissuers. The value of\nFund Shares may be more\nvolatile than the\nvalues of shares of\nmore diversified funds.\nThe Fund may become\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of tracking the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\n92\n\nTable of Contents Fund\nPerformance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and John Law. Michael Feehily,\nCFA, is a Senior Managing Director of the\nAdviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. John Law, CFA,\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2016. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n93\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n94\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 400 Mid Cap Growth ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Growth ETF (the    \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of an index that   \n  tracks                                      \n  the performance of medium capitalization    \n  exchange                                    \n  traded U.S. equity securities exhibiting    \n  \u201cgrowth\u201d                                    \n  characteristics.                            \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.15%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 37% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nMidCap 400 Growth Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the\n\n95\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only to\nthe extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nmeasures the\nperformance of the mid-\ncapitalization growth\nsegment of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nIndex consists of those\nstocks in the S&P\nMidCap 400 Index\nexhibiting the\nstrongest growth\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) sales growth;\n(ii) changes in\nearnings over price;\nand (iii) momentum. The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P MidCap 400\nIndex includes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE Arca,\nNYSE American, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX\nwith market\ncapitalizations between\n$3.6 billion and $13.1\nbillion at the time of\ninclusion. This\ncapitalization range\nmay be revised by the\nIndex Provider (as\ndefined below) at any\ntime. To be included in\nthe Index, a security\n(or issuer of a\nsecurity, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio of\n1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the sum\nof earnings over those\nquarters) and for the\nmost recent quarter.\nThe Index is market\ncapitalization weighted\nand rebalanced annually\non the third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe consumer\ndiscretionary,\nindustrial, technology\nand health care\nsectors, although this\nmay change from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 229 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-sized\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may be volatile.\nGrowth Stock Risk: The\nprices of growth stocks\nmay be based largely on\nexpectations of future\nearnings, and their\nprices can decline\nrapidly and\nsignificantly in\nreaction to negative\nnews. Growth stocks may\nunderperform value\nstocks and stocks in\nother broad style\ncategories (and the\nstock market as a\nwhole) over any period\nof time and may shift\nin and out of favor\nwith investors\ngenerally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on\nchanges in market,\neconomic, and other\nfactors. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\n96 Table of Contents\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector\nRisk: The success of\nconsumer product\nmanufacturers and\nretailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily\non disposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. Also,\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on their\nrespective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Health Care\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the health care\nsector are subject to\nextensive government\nregulation and their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of medical\nproducts and services,\npricing pressure\n(including price\ndiscounting), limited\nproduct lines and an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of\nhealthcare through\noutpatient services.\nCompanies in the health\ncare sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining\nand defending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in technologies\nor other market\ndevelopments. Many new\nproducts in the health\ncare sector require\nsignificant research\nand development and may\nbe subject to\nregulatory approvals,\nall of which may be\ntime consuming and\ncostly with no\nguarantee that any\nproduct will come to\nmarket. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause 97 Table of\nContents companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the\nFund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a timely\nbasis. In addition, the\nFund, due to\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of tracking the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. 98\n\nTable of Contents Fund\nPerformance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Juan Acevedo. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Juan Acevedo is\na Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2000. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n99\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 38%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nMidCap 400 Value Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n101\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nmeasures the\nperformance of the\nmid-capitalization\nvalue segment of the\nU.S. equity market.\nThe Index consists of\nthose stocks in the\nS&P MidCap 400 Index\nexhibiting the\nstrongest value\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) book value to\nprice ratio; (ii)\nearnings to price\nratio; and (iii) sales\nto price ratio. The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P MidCap 400\nIndex includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX with market\ncapitalizations\nbetween $3.6 billion\nand $13.1 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThis capitalization\nrange may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the\nsum of earnings over\nthose quarters) and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and\nrebalanced annually on\nthe third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial and\nindustrial sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 309 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Value Stock\nRisk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style\nof investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines. 102\nTable of Contents\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\n103\n\nTable of Contents to\ncontrol the U.S. (and\nother) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 28.56% (Q4,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 35.09% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 20.83%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Juan Acevedo. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Juan Acevedo is\na Vice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2000. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 4%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\n500 Fossil Fuel Free\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index (including\ncommon stock,\npreferred stock,\ndepositary receipts\nand shares of other\ninvestment companies),\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements\n\n106\n\nTable of Contents and\nmoney market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of\ncompanies in the S&P\n500 Index that are\n\u201cfossil fuel free\u201d,\nwhich are defined as\ncompanies that do not\nown fossil fuel\nreserves (either\nproven or probable).\nFor purposes of the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, fossil fuel\nreserves are defined\nas (i) thermal coal\nreserves, (ii) other\nnon-metallurgical coal\nreserves (e.g., coal\nfor chemical\nbiproducts, coal\nbriquettes,\nresidential use,\nliquid fuel, cement\nproduction, paper\nmanufacturing,\npharmaceutical,\nalumina refineries,\nferrochrome,\nanthracite) (iii)\nconventional or\nunconventional oil\nreserves (e.g.,\nnatural gas liquids,\noil sands, condensates\nand liquid petroleum\ngas), (iv) natural gas\nreserves, (v) shale\ngas reserves, and (vi)\noil and gas reserves\nthat have not been\ndisclosed\ntransparently as\nspecific types of oil\nor gas, or are\ndisclosed as one\naggregate quantity of\noil and gas reserves\ncombined. The Index is\na subset of the S&P\n500 Index (the\n\u201cUnderlying Index\u201d),\nwhich serves as the\ninitial universe of\neligible securities\nfor the Index. The\nUnderlying Index\nfocuses on the large\ncapitalization U.S.\nequity market,\nincluding common stock\nand real estate\ninvestment trusts\n(\u201cREITs\u201d). The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P 500 Index\nincludes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE\nArca, NYSE American,\nNASDAQ Global Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Select\nMarket, NASDAQ Capital\nMarket, Cboe BZX, Cboe\nBYX, Cboe EDGA, or\nCboe EDGX with\nunadjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $13.1 billion\nand float-adjusted\nmarket capitalizations\nof at least $6.55\nbillion at the time of\ninclusion. The minimum\nrequired\ncapitalization may be\nrevised by the Index\nProvider (as defined\nbelow) at any time. In\nconstructing the\nIndex, the initial\nuniverse is screened\nin an effort to\nexclude companies with\nany ownership of\nfossil fuel reserves,\nincluding for third-\nparty and in-house\npower generation, as\ndetermined by publicly\navailable information,\nsuch as annual reports\nand other company\npublications. The\nIndex is weighted by\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization. The\nIndex is rebalanced\nquarterly after the\nclose of business on\nthe third Friday of\nMarch, June,\nSeptember, and\nDecember. The\nrebalancing reference\ndates are after the\nclose of the third\nFriday of February,\nMay, August, and\nNovember,\nrespectively. New\nadditions to the\nUnderlying Index are\nreviewed for inclusion\nin the Index each\nquarter, provided they\nhave been added to the\nUnderlying Index by\nthe Index rebalancing\nreference dates.\nFossil fuel reserve\nownership information\nis updated as part of\neach quarterly\nrebalancing. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 492 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Fossil Fuel\nReserves Free\nOwnership Risk: The\nlack of ownership of\nfossil fuel reserves\nmay potentially have\nan adverse effect on a\ncompany's\nprofitability. The\nreturns on a portfolio\nof securities that\nseeks to exclude\ncompanies that own\nfossil fuel reserves\nmay trail the returns\non a portfolio of\nsecurities that\nincludes companies\nthat own fossil fuel\nreserves. Investing in\na portfolio of\nsecurities of\ncompanies that do not\nown fossil fuel\nreserves 107 Table of\nContents may affect\nthe Fund's exposure to\ncertain types of\ninvestments and may\nimpact the Fund's\nrelative investment\nperformance depending\non whether such\ninvestments are in or\nout of favor in the\nmarket. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). 108\n\nTable of Contents\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information\nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n110\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 600 Small Cap ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF (the         \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks                               \n  to provide investment results that, before  \n  fees                                        \n  and expenses, correspond generally to the   \n  total                                       \n  return performance of an index that tracks  \n  the                                         \n  performance of small capitalization         \n  exchange                                    \n  traded U.S. equity securities.              \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 13%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n111\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nmeasures the\nperformance of the\nsmall-capitalization\nsegment of the U.S.\nequity market. The\nselection universe for\nthe Index includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX with unadjusted\nmarket capitalizations\nbetween $850 million\nand $3.6 billion and\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalizations of at\nleast $425 million at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThese capitalization\nranges may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive\naggregate earnings\nover the four most\nrecent quarters and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. In selecting\nsecurities for\ninclusion in the\nIndex, the Index\nProvider also\nconsiders sector\nbalance by comparing\nthe weight of each\nGICS (Global Industry\nClassification\nStandard) sector in\nthe Index to its\nweight in the relevant\nmarket capitalization\nrange of the S&P Total\nMarket Index. The\nIndex is float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization\nweighted. Index\nconstituents are added\nand removed on an as-\nneeded basis. The\nIndex is rebalanced on\na quarterly basis in\nMarch, June, September\nand December. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nindustrial and\nfinancial sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 602 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines. 112\nTable of Contents\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\n113\n\nTable of Contents to\ncontrol the U.S. (and\nother) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 31.26% (Q4,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 32.63% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 20.01%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes. Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares. 114\n\nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                      One     Five    Ten     \n                      Year    Years   Years   \n  Return Before       11.32%  12.31%  11.81%  \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After Taxes  10.90%  11.64%  11.06%  \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions    6.82%   9.61%   9.53%   \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P SmallCap 600                            \n  Index (reflects no                          \n  deduction for       11.29%  12.37%  11.92%  \n  fees, expenses or                           \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for       18.40%  15.22%  13.88%  \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Mark Krivitsky. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Mark Krivitsky\nis a Vice President of the Adviser and a\nSenior Portfolio Manager in the Global Equity\nBeta Solutions Group and the Tax-Efficient\nMarket Capture Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1996. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n\n115\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 600 Small Cap Growth ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Growth ETF (the  \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of an index that   \n  tracks                                      \n  the performance of small capitalization     \n  exchange                                    \n  traded U.S. equity securities exhibiting    \n  \u201cgrowth\u201d                                    \n  characteristics.                            \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.15%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 38% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Growth\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the\n\n116\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only to\nthe extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nmeasures the\nperformance of the\nsmall-capitalization\ngrowth segment of the\nU.S. equity market. The\nIndex consists of those\nstocks in the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Index\nexhibiting the\nstrongest growth\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) sales growth;\n(ii) changes in\nearnings over price;\nand (iii) momentum. The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex includes all U.S.\ncommon equities listed\non the NYSE, NYSE Arca,\nNYSE American, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe EDGX\nwith market\ncapitalizations between\n$850 million and $3.6\nbillion at the time of\ninclusion. This\ncapitalization range\nmay be revised by the\nIndex Provider (as\ndefined below) at any\ntime. To be included in\nthe Index, a security\n(or issuer of a\nsecurity, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio of\n1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the sum\nof earnings over those\nquarters) and for the\nmost recent quarter.\nThe Index is market\ncapitalization weighted\nand rebalanced annually\non the third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, a significant\nportion of the Fund\ncomprised companies in\nthe consumer\ndiscretionary,\ntechnology, industrial\nand health care\nsectors, although this\nmay change from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 334 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies. These\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets or financial\nresources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of\nlarger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition,\nthese companies may\nhave been recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be illiquid\nor may be restricted as\nto resale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant volatility.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any time,\nor at a favorable\nprice, in order to meet\nthe Fund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Growth Stock\nRisk: The prices of\ngrowth stocks may be\nbased largely on\nexpectations of future\nearnings, and their\nprices can decline\nrapidly and\nsignificantly in\nreaction to negative\nnews. Growth stocks may\nunderperform value\nstocks and stocks in\nother broad style\ncategories (and the\nstock market as a\nwhole) over any period\nof time and may shift\nin and out of favor\nwith investors\ngenerally, sometimes\nrapidly, depending on\nchanges in market,\neconomic, and other\nfactors. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\n117 Table of Contents\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector\nRisk: The success of\nconsumer product\nmanufacturers and\nretailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends heavily\non disposable household\nincome and consumer\nspending. Also,\ncompanies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on their\nrespective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Health Care\nSector Risk: Companies\nin the health care\nsector are subject to\nextensive government\nregulation and their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of medical\nproducts and services,\npricing pressure\n(including price\ndiscounting), limited\nproduct lines and an\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of\nhealthcare through\noutpatient services.\nCompanies in the health\ncare sector are heavily\ndependent on obtaining\nand defending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in technologies\nor other market\ndevelopments. Many new\nproducts in the health\ncare sector require\nsignificant research\nand development and may\nbe subject to\nregulatory approvals,\nall of which may be\ntime consuming and\ncostly with no\nguarantee that any\nproduct will come to\nmarket. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their specific\nproduct or service and\nfor industrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause 118 Table of\nContents companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition of,\nand investor interest\nin, aerospace and\ndefense companies are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies which\nare typically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation\nsecurities, a component\nof the industrial\nsector, are cyclical\nand have occasional\nsharp price movements\nwhich may result from\nchanges in the economy,\nfuel prices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack of\na ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the\nFund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a timely\nbasis. In addition, the\nFund, due to\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of tracking the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and companies\nthat rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially\nthose of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies,\ntend to be more\nvolatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may\nadversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally, companies\nin the technology\nsector may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on one\nor more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the risk\nthat events negatively\naffecting such sectors\nor industries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing the\nvalue of the Fund's\nShares to decrease,\nperhaps significantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that\nare valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair valued\u201d\nsecurities, may be\nsubject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one day\nto the next than if\nmarket quotations were\nused. In addition,\nthere is no assurance\nthat the Fund could\nsell or close out a\nportfolio position for\nthe value established\nfor it at any time, and\nit is possible that the\nFund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime. 119\n\nTable of Contents Fund\nPerformance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                              \n                      One     Five    Ten     \n                      Year    Years   Years   \n  Return Before       19.42%  14.13%  13.26%  \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After Taxes  19.15%  13.58%  12.60%  \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions    11.59%  11.19%  10.87%  \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P SmallCap 600                            \n  Growth Index                                \n  (reflects no        19.60%  14.28%  13.43%  \n  deduction for                               \n  fees, expenses or                           \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for       18.40%  15.22%  13.88%  \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and David Chin. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. David Chin is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1999. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n120\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n121\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P 600 Small Cap Value ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Value ETF (the   \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of an index that   \n  tracks                                      \n  the performance of small capitalization     \n  exchange                                    \n  traded U.S. equity securities exhibiting    \n  \u201cvalue\u201d                                     \n  characteristics.                            \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.15%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.15%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $15        $48     $85     $192  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 36%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSmallCap 600 Value\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n122\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nmeasures the\nperformance of the\nsmall-capitalization\nvalue segment of the\nU.S. equity market.\nThe Index consists of\nthose stocks in the\nS&P SmallCap 600 Index\nexhibiting the\nstrongest value\ncharacteristics based\non: (i) book value to\nprice ratio; (ii)\nearnings to price\nratio; and (iii) sales\nto price ratio. The\nselection universe for\nthe S&P SmallCap 600\nIndex includes all\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX with market\ncapitalizations\nbetween $850 million\nand $3.6 billion at\nthe time of inclusion.\nThe capitalization\nrange may be revised\nby the Index Provider\n(as defined below) at\nany time. To be\nincluded in the Index,\na security (or issuer\nof a security, as\napplicable) should (i)\nhave an annual dollar\nvalue traded to float\nadjusted market\ncapitalization ratio\nof 1 or greater; (ii)\ntrade a minimum of\n250,000 shares in each\nof the six months\nleading up to the\nevaluation date; (iii)\nhave a public float of\nat least 10%; and (iv)\nhave positive as-\nreported earnings over\nthe most recent four\nconsecutive quarters\n(measured using the\nsum of earnings over\nthose quarters) and\nfor the most recent\nquarter. The Index is\nmarket capitalization\nweighted and\nrebalanced annually on\nthe third Friday of\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nfinancial and\nindustrial sectors,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 474 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Value Stock\nRisk: A \u201cvalue\u201d style\nof investing is\nsubject to the risk\nthat the returns on\n\u201cvalue\u201d equity\nsecurities are less\nthan returns on other\nstyles of investing or\nthe overall stock\nmarket. Value stocks\npresent the risk that\nthey may decline in\nprice or never reach\ntheir expected full\nmarket value because\nthe market fails to\nrecognize a stock's\nintrinsic worth.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times 123 Table\nof Contents when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\n124\n\nTable of Contents are\nheavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense\nspending policies\nwhich are typically\nunder pressure from\nefforts to control the\nU.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and David Chin. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. David Chin is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n1999. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 26%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nAerospace & Defense\nSelect Industry Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n127\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\naerospace and defense\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\naerospace & defense\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nAerospace & Defense\nsub-industry. The\nIndex is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the\nperformance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nAerospace & Defense\nsub-industry that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 33\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Aerospace and\nDefense Companies\nRisk: Aerospace and\ndefense companies can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\naerospace and defense\nregulation and\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely to a\nsignificant extent on\nU.S. (and other)\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. 128 Table of\nContents Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to 129\n\nTable of Contents\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 41%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nBanks Select Industry\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n132\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the banks\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nbanks segment of the\nS&P TMI comprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries: Asset\nManagement & Custody\nBanks, Diversified\nBanks, Regional Banks,\nOther Diversified\nFinancial Services,\nand Thrifts & Mortgage\nFinance. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the Asset\nManagement & Custody\nBanks, Diversified\nBanks, Regional Banks,\nOther Diversified\nFinancial Services,\nand Thrifts & Mortgage\nFinance sub-industries\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria:\n(i) have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization above\n$2 billion with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) above\n100%; and (ii) are\nU.S. based companies.\nTo evaluate liquidity,\nthe dollar value\ntraded for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history is\nannualized. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $1 billion or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 95\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Banking\nCompanies Risk: The\nperformance of bank\nstocks may be affected\nby extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, and the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds,\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers can\nnegatively impact\nbanking companies.\nBanks may also be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nCompetition is high\namong banking\ncompanies and failure\nto maintain or\nincrease market share\nmay result in lost\nmarket value. 133\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Institutions\nRisk: Changes in the\ncreditworthiness of\nfinancial institutions\n(such as banks and\nbroker-dealers) may\nadversely affect the\nvalues of instruments\nof issuers in\nfinancial industries.\nAdverse developments\nin banking and other\nfinancial industries\nmay cause the Fund to\nunderperform relative\nto other funds that\ninvest more broadly\nacross different\nindustries or have a\nsmaller exposure to\nfinancial\ninstitutions. Changes\nin governmental\nregulation and\noversight of financial\ninstitutions may have\nan adverse effect on\nthe financial\ncondition of a\nfinancial institution.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more 134\n\nTable of Contents\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective October 24, 2011 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the KBW Bank\nIndex (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the\nS&P Banks Select Industry Index, consistent\nwith a change in the Fund's principal\ninvestment strategy to track the performance\nof the current index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 74%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nBiotechnology Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n137\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\nbiotechnology segment\nof the S&P Total\nMarket Index (\u201cS&P\nTMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the\nbroad U.S. equity\nmarket. The\nbiotechnology segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nBiotechnology sub-\nindustry. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nBiotechnology sub-\nindustry that satisfy\nthe following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nIf there are fewer\nthan 35 stocks, stocks\nfrom the Life Sciences\nTools & Services sub-\nindustry that meet the\nmarket capitalization\nand liquidity\nthresholds are\nincluded in order of\ntheir float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\nfrom largest to\nsmallest. If there\ncontinues to be fewer\nthan 22 stocks, the\nmarket capitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month.

The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 195\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Biotechnology\nCompanies Risk:\nBiotech companies\ninvest heavily in\nresearch and\ndevelopment which may\nnot necessarily lead\nto commercially\nsuccessful products.\nThese companies are\nalso subject to\nincreased governmental\nregulation which may\ndelay or inhibit the\nrelease of new\nproducts. Many biotech\ncompanies are\ndependent upon their\nability to use and\nenforce intellectual\nproperty rights and\npatents. Any\nimpairment of such\nrights may have\nadverse financial\nconsequences. Biotech\nstocks, especially\nthose of smaller,\nless-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nBiotech companies can\nbe significantly\naffected by\ntechnological change\nand obsolescence,\nproduct liability\nlawsuits and\nconsequential high\ninsurance costs. 138\nTable of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Health\nCare Sector Risk:\nCompanies in the\nhealth care sector are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernment regulation\nand their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of\nmedical products and\nservices, pricing\npressure (including\nprice discounting),\nlimited product lines\nand an increased\nemphasis on the\ndelivery of healthcare\nthrough outpatient\nservices. Companies in\nthe health care sector\nare heavily dependent\non obtaining and\ndefending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in\ntechnologies or other\nmarket developments.\nMany new products in\nthe health care sector\nrequire significant\nresearch and\ndevelopment and may be\nsubject to regulatory\napprovals, all of\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly\nwith no guarantee that\nany product will come\nto market. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to 139\n\nTable of Contents\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Raymond Donofrio. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Raymond\nDonofrio is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Global\nEquity Beta Solutions Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2008.\n\n140\n\nTable of Contents Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 37%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nCapital Markets Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n142\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the capital\nmarkets segment of the\nS&P Total Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\ncapital markets\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries: Asset\nManagement & Custody\nBanks, Diversified\nCapital Markets,\nFinancial Exchanges &\nData, and Investment\nBanking & Brokerage.\nThe Index is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the\nperformance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the Asset\nManagement & Custody\nBanks, Diversified\nCapital Markets,\nFinancial Exchanges &\nData, and Investment\nBanking & Brokerage\nsub-industries that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 62\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Capital Markets\nCompanies Risk:\nCapital Markets\ncompanies may be\nsignificantly affected\nby stock and bank\ntrading activity,\nchanges in\ngovernmental\nregulation, continuing\nincreases in price\ncompetition, decreases\nin fees or fee-related\nbusiness, including\ninvestment banking,\nbrokerage, asset\nmanagement and other\nservicing fees,\nfluctuation in\ninterest rates and\nother factors which\ncould adversely affect\nfinancial markets. 143\nTable of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 144\n\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective October 24, 2011 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the KBW Capital\nMarkets Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d)\nto the S&P Capital Markets Select Industry\nIndex, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Kala O'Donnell.\n\n145\n\nTable of Contents Michael Feehily, CFA, is a\nSenior Managing Director of the Adviser and\nthe Head of Global Equity Beta Solutions in\nthe Americas. He worked at the Adviser from\n1997 to 2006 and rejoined in 2010. Karl\nSchneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the\nAdviser and Deputy Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He joined the\nAdviser in 1997. Kala O'Donnell is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n1995. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 22%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nHigh Yield Dividend\nAristocrats Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n147\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nis designed to measure\nthe performance of the\nhighest dividend\nyielding S&P Composite\n1500 \u00aeIndex\nconstituents that have\nfollowed a managed-\ndividends policy of\nconsistently\nincreasing dividends\nevery year for at\nleast 20 consecutive\nyears. Stocks included\nin the Index have both\ncapital growth and\ndividend income\ncharacteristics, as\nopposed to stocks that\nare pure yield, or\npure capital oriented,\nand must meet minimum\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization and\nliquidity\nrequirements. Stocks\nwithin the Index are\nweighted by indicated\nyield (annualized\ngross dividend payment\nper share divided by\nprice per share) and\nweight-adjusted each\nquarter. The Index\ncomponents are\nreviewed annually in\nJanuary for continued\ninclusion in the Index\nand re-weighted\nquarterly after the\nclosing of the last\nbusiness day of\nJanuary, April, July\nand October. If\nbetween annual reviews\nthe Index Provider (as\ndefined below)\ndetermines, based on\npublicly available\ninformation, that an\nIndex constituent has\nomitted a scheduled\ndividend payment,\nannounced it will\ncease paying dividends\nfor an undetermined\nperiod, or announced a\nreduced dividend\namount and will no\nlonger qualify for the\nIndex at the\nsubsequent\nreconstitution, the\nIndex constituent will\nbe removed from the\nindex effective prior\nto the open of the\nfirst business day of\nthe following month.\nAs of July 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\nindustrial and energy\nsectors, although this\nmay change from time\nto time. As of July\n31, 2021, the Index\ncomprised 112 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Dividend Paying\nSecurities Risk:\nSecurities that pay\ndividends, as a group,\ncan fall out of favor\nwith the market,\ncausing such companies\nto underperform\ncompanies that do not\npay dividends. In\naddition, changes in\nthe dividend policies\nof the companies held\nby the Fund or the\ncapital resources\navailable for such\ncompany's dividend\npayments may adversely\naffect the Fund.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty. 148\nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Energy\nSector Risk: Issuers\nin energy-related\nindustries can be\nsignificantly affected\nby fluctuations in\nenergy prices and\nsupply and demand of\nenergy fuels. Markets\nfor various energy-\nrelated commodities\ncan have significant\nvolatility, and are\nsubject to control or\nmanipulation by large\nproducers or\npurchasers. Companies\nin the energy sector\nmay need to make\nsubstantial\nexpenditures, and to\nincur significant\namounts of debt, in\norder to maintain or\nexpand their reserves.\nOil and gas\nexploration and\nproduction can be\nsignificantly affected\nby natural disasters\nas well as changes in\nexchange rates,\ninterest rates,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions.\nThese companies may be\nat risk for\nenvironmental damage\nclaims. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). 149\n\nTable of Contents\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

He joined the Adviser in 2006. Purchase\nand Sale Information The Fund will issue (or\nredeem) Fund Shares to certain institutional\ninvestors (typically market makers or other\nbroker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund\nShares known as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation\nUnit transactions are conducted in exchange\nfor the deposit or delivery of a designated\nportfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash.\n\n150\n\nTable of Contents Individual Fund Shares may\nonly be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca,\nInc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 39%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nHealth Care Equipment\nSelect Industry Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n152\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the health\ncare equipment segment\nof the S&P Total\nMarket Index (\u201cS&P\nTMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the\nbroad U.S. equity\nmarket. The health\ncare equipment segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries: Health\nCare Equipment and\nHealth Care Supplies.\nThe Index is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the\nperformance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nHealth Care Equipment\nand Health Care\nServices sub-\nindustries that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month.

The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 85\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Health Care\nEquipment Companies\nRisk: Health care\nequipment companies\nare affected by rising\ncosts of medical\nproducts, devices and\nservices and the\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of health\ncare through\noutpatient services.\nCompetition among\nhealth care equipment\ncompanies is high and\ncan be significantly\naffected by extensive\ngovernment regulation\nor government\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses. The\nequipment may be\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nmalpractice claims,\nproduct liability\nclaims or other\nlitigation. Medical\nequipment\nmanufacturers are\nheavily dependent on\npatent protection and\nthe expiration of\npatents may adversely\naffect their\nprofitability. Many\nnew health care\nproducts are subject\nto the approval of the\nU.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration\n(\u201cFDA\u201d). The process\nof obtaining FDA\napproval is often long\nand expensive. 153\nTable of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Health\nCare Sector Risk:\nCompanies in the\nhealth care sector are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernment regulation\nand their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of\nmedical products and\nservices, pricing\npressure (including\nprice discounting),\nlimited product lines\nand an increased\nemphasis on the\ndelivery of healthcare\nthrough outpatient\nservices. Companies in\nthe health care sector\nare heavily dependent\non obtaining and\ndefending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in\ntechnologies or other\nmarket developments.\nMany new products in\nthe health care sector\nrequire significant\nresearch and\ndevelopment and may be\nsubject to regulatory\napprovals, all of\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly\nwith no guarantee that\nany product will come\nto market. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to 154\n\nTable of Contents\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 38%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nHealth Care Services\nSelect Industry Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n157\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the health\ncare services segment\nof the S&P Total\nMarket Index (\u201cS&P\nTMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the\nbroad U.S. equity\nmarket. The health\ncare services segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries: Health\nCare Distributors,\nHealth Care\nFacilities, Health\nCare Services, and\nManaged Health Care.\nThe Index is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the\nperformance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nHealth Care\nDistributors, Health\nCare Facilities,\nHealth Care Services,\nand Managed Health\nCare sub-industries\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria:\n(i) have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month.

The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Health Care\nServices Companies\nRisk: Health care\nservices companies are\naffected by rising\ncosts of medical\nproducts, devices and\nservices and the\nincreased emphasis on\nthe delivery of health\ncare through\noutpatient services.\nCompetition is high\namong health care\nservices companies and\ncan be significantly\naffected by extensive\ngovernment regulation\nor government\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses. The\nequipment may be\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nmalpractice claims,\nproduct liability\nclaims or other\nlitigation. Medical\nequipment\nmanufacturers are\nheavily dependent on\npatent protection and\nthe expiration of\npatents may adversely\naffect their\nprofitability. Many\nnew health care\nproducts are subject\nto the approval of the\nU.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration\n(\u201cFDA\u201d). The process\nof obtaining FDA\napproval is often long\nand expensive. 158\nTable of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Health\nCare Sector Risk:\nCompanies in the\nhealth care sector are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernment regulation\nand their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of\nmedical products and\nservices, pricing\npressure (including\nprice discounting),\nlimited product lines\nand an increased\nemphasis on the\ndelivery of healthcare\nthrough outpatient\nservices. Companies in\nthe health care sector\nare heavily dependent\non obtaining and\ndefending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in\ntechnologies or other\nmarket developments.\nMany new products in\nthe health care sector\nrequire significant\nresearch and\ndevelopment and may be\nsubject to regulatory\napprovals, all of\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly\nwith no guarantee that\nany product will come\nto market. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to 159\n\nTable of Contents\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 24%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nHomebuilders Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n162\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\nhomebuilders segment\nof the S&P Total\nMarket Index (\u201cS&P\nTMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the\nbroad U.S. equity\nmarket. The\nhomebuilders segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nHomebuilding sub-\nindustry. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nHomebuilding sub-\nindustry that satisfy\nthe following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nIf there are fewer\nthan 35 stocks, stocks\nfrom the Building\nProducts, Home\nFurnishings, Home\nImprovement Retail,\nHomefurnishing Retail,\nor Household\nAppliances sub-\nindustries that meet\nthe market\ncapitalization and\nliquidity thresholds\nare included in order\nof their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization from\nlargest to smallest.\nIf there continues to\nbe fewer than 22\nstocks, the market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month.

The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Homebuilding\nCompanies Risk:\nHomebuilding companies\ncan be significantly\naffected by the\nnational, regional and\nlocal real estate\nmarkets. This industry\nis also sensitive to\ninterest rate\nfluctuations which can\ncause changes in the\navailability of\nmortgage capital and\ndirectly affect the\npurchasing power of\npotential homebuyers.\nThe building industry\ncan be significantly\naffected by changes in\ngovernment spending,\nconsumer confidence,\ndemographic patterns\nand the level of new\nand existing home\nsales. 163 Table of\nContents Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector\nRisk: The success of\nconsumer product\nmanufacturers and\nretailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\n164\n\nTable of Contents to\ncontrol the U.S. (and\nother) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Retail\nCompanies Risk: Retail\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby the performance of\nthe domestic and\ninternational economy,\nconsumer confidence\nand spending, intense\ncompetition, changes\nin demographics, and\nchanging consumer\ntastes and\npreferences.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 47.95% (Q2,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 34.46% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 25.07%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                              \n                      One     Five    Ten     \n                      Year    Years   Years   \n  Return Before       27.73%  12.02%  13.62%  \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After Taxes  27.44%  11.79%  13.42%  \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions    16.53%  9.54%   11.42%  \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P Homebuilders                            \n  Select Industry                             \n  Index (reflects     27.81%  12.31%  13.95%  \n  no deduction for                            \n  fees, expenses or                           \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for       18.40%  15.22%  13.88%  \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Raymond Donofrio.\n\n165\n\nTable of Contents Michael Feehily, CFA, is a\nSenior Managing Director of the Adviser and\nthe Head of Global Equity Beta Solutions in\nthe Americas. He worked at the Adviser from\n1997 to 2006 and rejoined in 2010. Karl\nSchneider, CAIA, is a Managing Director of the\nAdviser and Deputy Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He joined the\nAdviser in 1997. Raymond Donofrio is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2008. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n166\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Insurance ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d)     \n  seeks to                                    \n  provide investment results that, before     \n  fees and                                    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  total return                                \n  performance of an index that tracks the     \n  performance of publicly traded companies    \n  in the                                      \n  insurance industry.                         \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 24%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nInsurance Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n167\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\ninsurance segment of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\ninsurance segment of\nthe S&P TMI comprises\nthe following sub-\nindustries: Insurance\nBrokers, Life & Health\nInsurance, Multi-Line\nInsurance, Property &\nCasualty Insurance,\nand Reinsurance. The\nIndex is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the\nperformance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nInsurance Brokers,\nLife & Health\nInsurance, Multi-Line\nInsurance, Property &\nCasualty Insurance,\nand Reinsurance sub-\nindustries that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization above\n$2 billion with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) above\n90%; and (ii) are U.S.\nbased companies. To\nevaluate liquidity,\nthe dollar value\ntraded for initial\npublic offerings or\nspin-offs that do not\nhave 12 months of\ntrading history is\nannualized. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $1 billion or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 54\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Insurance\nCompanies Risk:\nInsurance companies'\nprofits are affected\nby many factors,\nincluding interest\nrate movements, the\nimposition of premium\nrate caps, competition\nand pressure to\ncompete globally.\nCertain types of\ninsurance companies\nmay also be affected\nby weather\ncatastrophes and other\ndisasters and\nmortality rates. In\naddition, although\ninsurance companies\nare currently subject\nto extensive\nregulation, such\ncompanies may be\nadversely affected by\nincreased governmental\nregulations or tax law\nchanges in the future.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times 168 Table\nof Contents when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Financial\nSector Risk: Financial\nservices companies are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge, the scope\nof their activities,\nthe prices they can\ncharge and the amount\nof capital they must\nmaintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change\nor due to increased\ncompetition. In\naddition,\ndeterioration of the\ncredit markets\ngenerally may cause an\nadverse impact in a\nbroad range of\nmarkets, including\nU.S. and international\ncredit and interbank\nmoney markets\ngenerally, thereby\naffecting a wide range\nof financial\ninstitutions and\nmarkets. Certain\nevents in the\nfinancial sector may\ncause an unusually\nhigh degree of\nvolatility in the\nfinancial markets,\nboth domestic and\nforeign, and cause\ncertain financial\nservices companies to\nincur large losses.\nSecurities of\nfinancial services\ncompanies may\nexperience a dramatic\ndecline in value when\nsuch companies\nexperience substantial\ndeclines in the\nvaluations of their\nassets, take action to\nraise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt\nor equity securities),\nor cease operations.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers and\nfinancial losses\nassociated with\ninvestment activities\ncan negatively impact\nthe sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nAdverse economic,\nbusiness or political\ndevelopments could\nadversely affect\nfinancial institutions\nengaged in mortgage\nfinance or other\nlending or investing\nactivities directly or\nindirectly connected\nto the value of real\nestate. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso 169\n\nTable of Contents\nlimit the ability of\nthe Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 20.58% (Q4,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 29.20% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005\u00a09/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 14.15%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes. Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective October 24, 2011 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the KBW Insurance\nIndex (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d) to the\nS&P Insurance Select Industry Index,\nconsistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index. Performance\nof the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index\nChange Date is therefore based on the Fund's\ninvestment strategy to track the Previous\nBenchmark Index and may have been different\nhad the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                              \n                      One     Five    Ten     \n                      Year    Years   Years   \n  Return Before       -3.14%  9.69%   10.83%  \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After Taxes  -3.64%  9.21%   10.39%  \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions    -1.61%  7.61%   8.88%   \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P Insurance                               \n  Select Industry                             \n  Index/KBW                                   \n  Insurance           -2.79%  10.09%  11.24%  \n  Index1 (reflects                            \n  no deduction for                            \n  fees, expenses                              \n  or taxes)                                   \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for       18.40%  15.22%  13.88%  \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.

Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 52%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nInternet Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n172\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\ninternet segment of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\ninternet segment of\nthe S&P TMI comprises\nthe Internet & Direct\nMarketing Retail,\nInternet Services &\nInfrastructure, and\nInteractive Media &\nServices sub-\nindustries. The Index\nis one of twenty-one\n(21) of the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nInternet & Direct\nMarketing Retail,\nInternet Services &\nInfrastructure, and\nInteractive Media &\nServices sub-\nindustries that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The S&\nP TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 58\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Internet Segment\nRisk: Internet\ncompanies are subject\nto rapid changes in\ntechnology, worldwide\ncompetition, rapid\nobsolescence of\nproducts and services,\nloss of patent\nprotections, cyclical\nmarket patterns,\nevolving industry\nstandards and frequent\nnew product\nintroductions.\nCompetitive pressures,\nsuch as technological\ndevelopments, fixed-\nrate pricing and the\nability to attract and\nretain skilled\nemployees, can\nsignificantly affect\ninternet companies,\nand changing domestic\nand international\ndemand, research and\ndevelopment costs,\navailability and price\ncomponents and product\nobsolescence also can\naffect their\nprofitability. 173\nTable of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCommunication Services\nSector Risk:\nCommunication services\ncompanies are\nparticularly\nvulnerable to the\npotential obsolescence\nof products and\nservices due to\ntechnological\nadvancement and the\ninnovation of\ncompetitors. Companies\nin the communication\nservices sector may\nalso be affected by\nother competitive\npressures, such as\npricing competition,\nas well as research\nand development costs,\nsubstantial capital\nrequirements and\ngovernment regulation.\nAdditionally,\nfluctuating domestic\nand international\ndemand, shifting\ndemographics and often\nunpredictable changes\nin consumer tastes can\ndrastically affect a\ncommunication services\ncompany's\nprofitability. While\nall companies may be\nsusceptible to network\nsecurity breaches,\ncertain companies in\nthe communication\nservices sector may be\nparticular targets of\nhacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary\nor consumer\ninformation or\ndisruptions in\nservice, which could\nhave a material\nadverse effect on\ntheir businesses.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector\nRisk: The success of\nconsumer product\nmanufacturers and\nretailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 174\n\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts.

He\nworked at the Adviser from 1997 to 2006 and\nrejoined in 2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a\nManaging Director of the Adviser and Deputy\nHead of Global Equity Beta Solutions in the\nAmericas. He joined the Adviser in 1997.\nRaymond Donofrio is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 2008. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n176\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Kensho Clean Power ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Kensho Clean Power ETF (the    \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of the S&P Kensho  \n  Clean                                       \n  Power Index.                                \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.45%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 43%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho Clean Power\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n177\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nof companies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide which are\nincluded in the Clean\nPower sector as\ndetermined by a\nclassification\nstandard produced by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d). The Index\nis designed to capture\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nbehind clean power. In\nparticular, the Index\ncomprises the\ncomponents of the S&P\nKensho Cleantech Index\nfocused on clean\nenergy technology\n(hardware, software,\nand construction and\ninstallation of\nmaterials used for\ncapturing energy, as\nwell as advanced\nenergy storage\ndevices), and the S&P\nKensho Clean Energy\nIndex focused on clean\nenergy generation\n(generation and\ntransmission of power\nderived from clean\nenergy sources) (the\n\u201cUnderlying Indexes\u201d)\nas of the Index's\nsemi-annual selection\ndate, on the first\nFriday in June and\nDecember, subject to\nthe following\nliquidity thresholds\nfor each component:\n(i) must be issued by\na company with a\nminimum float market\ncapitalization of at\nleast $100 million and\n(ii) must have a\nminimum three-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of at least $1\nmillion. The S&P\nKensho Cleantech Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies focused on\nbuilding technologies\nor products that\nenable generation of\nenergy in a clean\nmanner (solar, wind,\ngeothermal, hydrogen\nand hydroelectric).\nThe S&P Kensho Clean\nEnergy Index seeks to\ntrack companies\nfocused on the\ngeneration and\ntransmission of energy\nderived from clean\nsources (solar, wind,\ngeothermal, hydrogen\nand hydroelectric). To\ndetermine the\nconstituents of the\nUnderlying Indexes,\nthe Index Provider's\nclassification\nstandard utilizes an\nautomated scan of\ncompanies' most recent\nregulatory filings\nwith the U.S.\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission on\nForm 10-K, Form 20-F,\nForm 40-F, or S-1\nfiling and prospectus,\nas applicable, to\nidentify specific\nsearch terms and\nphrases that describe\na company as producing\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities\nfor each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered\nby eliminating\ncompanies that do not\ninclude in their\nregulatory filings a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and\n(ii) is used in a\nmanner that is within\nthe scope of the\nUnderlying Index's\nobjective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are\nnot listed on NYSE,\nNASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an\naffiliate of one of\nthose exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining\neligible constituent\nto verify the rules of\nthe automated scan\nwere implemented\ncorrectly. Underlying\nIndex constituents are\nthen categorized as\neither \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is\ncategorized as Core if\nits products and\nservices related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nregulatory filings as\nprincipal components\nof the company's\nstrategy. Products and\nservices are deemed to\nbe principal\ncomponents of a\ncompany's strategy if\nthe company's\nregulatory filing\ndisclosures regarding\nsuch products and\nservices are\ndetermined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on\nthe frequency and\nposition of such\ndisclosures within\nregulatory filings.\nAll other companies\nare categorized as\nNon-Core, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain of the\nsegment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index.\nAn Index constituent\ncategorized as Core by\nat least one of the\nUnderlying Indexes\nwill be categorized as\nCore for purposes of\nthe Index. At the time\nof each rebalance, to\ntilt the Index's\nexposure toward Core\nIndex Constituents,\nthe Core Index\nConstituents are\nsystematically\noverweighted relative\nto the Non-Core Index\nConstituents. Each\nCore Index Constituent\nand Non-Core Index\nConstituent is then\nequally weighted\nwithin the group of\nCore Index\nConstituents and Non-\nCore Index\nConstituents,\nrespectively, subject\nto liquidity and\ndiversification\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, the Index\ncomprised 43\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. 178\nTable of Contents\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Clean Power\nCompanies Risk : Clean\npower companies may be\nhighly dependent upon\ngovernment subsidies,\ncontracts with\ngovernment entities,\nand the successful\ndevelopment of new and\nproprietary\ntechnologies. Clean\npower companies may be\naffected by\ncompetition from new\nand existing market\nentrants, obsolescence\nof technology, short\nproduct cycles,\nchanges in exchange\nrates, imposition of\nimport controls, and\ndepletion of\nresources. In\naddition, seasonal\nweather conditions,\nfluctuations in supply\nof and demand for\nclean energy products\nor services, and\ninternational\npolitical events may\ncause fluctuations in\nthe performance of\nclean power companies\nand the prices of\ntheir securities.\nRisks associated with\nfluctuations in energy\nprices and supply and\ndemand of alternative\nenergy fuels, energy\nconservation, the\nsuccess of exploration\nprojects and tax and\nother government\nregulations can\nsignificantly affect\nclean power companies.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In\ngeneral, cyber-attacks\nare deliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may\nresult in material\nadverse consequences\nfor such company, as\nwell as other\ncompanies included in\nthe Index, and may\ncause the Fund's\ninvestments to lose\nvalue. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. 179 Table\nof Contents Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible\ntrade barriers,\ncurrency transfer\nrestrictions, a more\nlimited number of\npotential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew 180 Table of\nContents key\nemployees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUtilities Sector Risk:\nUtility companies are\naffected by supply and\ndemand, operating\ncosts, government\nregulation,\nenvironmental factors,\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities, and rate\ncaps or rate changes.\nAlthough rate changes\nof a utility usually\nfluctuate in\napproximate\ncorrelation with\nfinancing costs, due\nto political and\nregulatory factors\nrate changes\nordinarily occur only\nfollowing a delay\nafter the changes in\nfinancing costs. This\nfactor will tend to\nfavorably affect a\nregulated utility\ncompany's earnings and\ndividends in times of\ndecreasing costs, but\nconversely, will tend\nto adversely affect\nearnings and dividends\nwhen costs are rising.\nThe value of regulated\nutility debt\nsecurities (and, to a\nlesser extent, equity\nsecurities) may tend\nto have an inverse\nrelationship to the\nmovement of interest\nrates. Certain utility\ncompanies have\nexperienced full or\npartial deregulation\nin recent years. These\nutility companies are\nfrequently more\nsimilar to industrial\ncompanies in that 181\n\nTable of Contents they\nare subject to greater\ncompetition and have\nbeen permitted by\nregulators to\ndiversify outside of\ntheir original\ngeographic regions and\ntheir traditional\nlines of business.\nThese opportunities\nmay permit certain\nutility companies to\nearn more than their\ntraditional regulated\nrates of return. Some\ncompanies, however,\nmay be forced to\ndefend their core\nbusiness and may be\nless profitable. In\naddition, natural\ndisasters, terrorist\nattacks, government\nintervention or other\nfactors may render a\nutility company's\nequipment unusable or\nobsolete and\nnegatively impact\nprofitability. Among\nthe risks that may\naffect utility\ncompanies are the\nfollowing: risks of\nincreases in fuel and\nother operating costs;\nthe high cost of\nborrowing to finance\ncapital construction\nduring inflationary\nperiods; restrictions\non operations and\nincreased costs and\ndelays associated with\ncompliance with\nenvironmental and\nnuclear safety\nregulations; and the\ndifficulties involved\nin obtaining natural\ngas for resale or fuel\nfor generating\nelectricity at\nreasonable prices.\nOther risks include\nthose related to the\nconstruction and\noperation of nuclear\npower plants, the\neffects of energy\nconservation and the\neffects of regulatory\nchanges. Valuation\nRisk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially\na large portion of the\nFund's investment\nportfolio, may be\nvalued on the basis of\nfactors other than\nmarket quotations.\nThis may occur more\noften in times of\nmarket turmoil or\nreduced liquidity.\nThere are multiple\nmethods that can be\nused to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

He\nworked at the Adviser from 1997 to 2006 and\nrejoined in 2010. Kathleen Morgan, CFA, is a\nVice President of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n2017. Mark Krivitsky is a Vice President of\nthe Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in\nthe Global Equity Beta Solutions Group and the\nTax-Efficient Market Capture Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 1996. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.45%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 43%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho Final Frontiers\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n184\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nof companies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide which are\nincluded in the Final\nFrontiers sector as\ndetermined by a\nclassification\nstandard produced by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d). The Index\nis designed to capture\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nbehind the exploration\nof deep space and deep\nsea. In particular,\nthe Index comprises\nthe components of the\nS&P Kensho Space Index\nand the deep sea\nexploration components\nof the S&P Kensho\nDrones Index (the\n\u201cUnderlying Indexes\u201d)\nas of the Index's\nsemi-annual selection\ndate, on the first\nFriday in June and\nDecember, subject to\nthe following\nliquidity thresholds\nfor each component:\n(i) must be issued by\na company with a\nminimum float market\ncapitalization of at\nleast $100 million and\n(ii) must have a\nminimum three-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of at least $1\nmillion. The S&P\nKensho Space Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nthat enable space\ntravel and\nexploration, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Drones Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nremotely-operated or\nunmanned aerial,\nunderwater and\nsurface-level drones\nmarket, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. To determine\nthe constituents of\nthe Underlying\nIndexes, the Index\nProvider's\nclassification\nstandard utilizes an\nautomated scan of\ncompanies' most recent\nregulatory filings\nwith the U.S.\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission on\nForm 10-K, Form 20-F,\nForm 40-F, or S-1\nfiling and prospectus,\nas applicable, to\nidentify specific\nsearch terms and\nphrases that describe\na company as producing\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities\nfor each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered\nby eliminating\ncompanies that do not\ninclude in their\nregulatory filings a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and\n(ii) is used in a\nmanner that is within\nthe scope of the\nUnderlying Index's\nobjective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are\nnot listed on NYSE,\nNASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an\naffiliate of one of\nthose exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining\neligible constituent\nto verify the rules of\nthe automated scan\nwere implemented\ncorrectly. Underlying\nIndex constituents are\nthen categorized as\neither \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is\ncategorized as Core if\nits products and\nservices related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nregulatory filings as\nprincipal components\nof the company's\nstrategy. Products and\nservices are deemed to\nbe principal\ncomponents of a\ncompany's strategy if\nthe company's\nregulatory filing\ndisclosures regarding\nsuch products and\nservices are\ndetermined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on\nthe frequency and\nposition of such\ndisclosures within\nregulatory filings.\nAll other companies\nare categorized as\nNon-Core, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain of the\nsegment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index.\nAn Index constituent\ncategorized as Core by\nat least one of the\nUnderlying Indexes\nwill be categorized as\nCore for purposes of\nthe Index. At the time\nof each rebalance, to\ntilt the Index's\nexposure toward Core\nIndex Constituents,\nthe Core Index\nConstituents are\nsystematically\noverweighted relative\nto the Non-Core Index\nConstituents. Each\nCore Index Constituent\nand Non-Core Index\nConstituent is then\nequally weighted\nwithin the group of\nCore Index\nConstituents and Non-\nCore Index\nConstituents,\nrespectively, subject\nto liquidity and\ndiversification\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, the Index\ncomprised 35\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. 185\nTable of Contents\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Aerospace and\nDefense Companies\nRisk: Aerospace and\ndefense companies can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\naerospace and defense\nregulation and\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely to a\nsignificant extent on\nU.S. (and other)\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Drone\nCompanies Risk: Drone\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets, financial\nresources or personnel\nand are subject to the\nrisks of changes in\nbusiness cycles, world\neconomic growth,\ntechnological\nprogress, and\ngovernment regulation.\nSecurities of drone\ncompanies, especially\nsmaller, start-up\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than\nsecurities of\ncompanies that do not\nrely heavily on\ntechnology. These\ncompanies may face\nintense competition\nand potentially rapid\nproduct obsolescence.\nIn addition, drone\ncompanies may be\ndependent on the U.S.\ngovernment and its\nagencies for a\nsignificant portion of\ntheir sales, and their\nsuccess and growth may\nbe dependent on their\nability to win future\ngovernment contracts.\nAs a result, such\ncompanies may be\nnegatively affected by\nbudgetary constraints,\nspending reductions,\ncongressional\nappropriations, and\nadministrative\nallocations of funds\nthat affect the U.S.\ngovernment and its\nagencies. Drone\ncompanies may rely on\na combination of\npatents, copyrights,\ntrademarks and trade\nsecret laws to\nestablish and protect\ntheir proprietary\nrights in their\nproducts and\ntechnologies, and may\nbe adversely affected\nby loss or impairment\nof those rights. Legal\nand regulatory changes\nmay have an impact on\na drone company's\nproducts or services.\nIn addition, drone\ncompanies may also be\nsubject to increasing\nregulatory constraints\nthat may limit the\nsale or use of a\ncompany's products,\nincluding the need to\nobtain regulatory\napprovals from certain\ngovernment agencies.\nDrone companies\ntypically engage in\nsignificant amounts of\nspending on research\nand development, and\nthere is no guarantee\nthat the products or\nservices produced by\nthese companies will\nbe successful.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In\ngeneral, cyber-attacks\nare deliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may\nresult in material\nadverse consequences\nfor such company, as\nwell as other\ncompanies included in\nthe Index, and may\ncause the Fund's\ninvestments to lose\nvalue. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith 186 Table of\nContents respect to\nthe underlying\nsecurities or to\ncompel the issuer of\nthe receipts to take\naction. The prices of\ndepositary receipts\nmay differ from the\nprices of securities\nupon which they are\nbased. To the extent\nthe Fund invests in\ndepositary receipts\nbased on securities\nincluded in the Index,\nsuch differences in\nprices may increase\nindex tracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible\ntrade barriers,\ncurrency transfer\nrestrictions, a more\nlimited number of\npotential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, 187 Table of\nContents product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily 188\n\nTable of Contents\ndependent on patent\nand intellectual\nproperty rights, the\nloss or impairment of\nwhich may adversely\naffect profitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

She joined the Adviser in\n2017. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.45%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 39%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho Future Security\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n191\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nof companies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide which are\nincluded in the Future\nSecurity sector as\ndetermined by a\nclassification\nstandard produced by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d). The Index\nis designed to capture\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nbehind future\nsecurity. In\nparticular, the Index\ncomprises the\ncomponents of the S&P\nKensho Cyber Security\nIndex and the S&P\nKensho Smart Borders\nIndex, and the\nmilitary components of\nthe S&P Kensho\nRobotics Index, the\nS&P Kensho Drones\nIndex, the S&P Kensho\nSpace Index, the S&P\nKensho Wearables Index\nand the S&P Kensho\nVirtual Reality Index\n(the \u201cUnderlying\nIndexes\u201d) as of the\nIndex's semi-annual\nselection date, on the\nfirst Friday in June\nand December, subject\nto the following\nliquidity thresholds\nfor each component:\n(i) must be issued by\na company with a\nminimum float market\ncapitalization of at\nleast $100 million and\n(ii) must have a\nminimum three-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of at least $1\nmillion. The S&P\nKensho Cyber Security\nIndex seeks to track\ncompanies that focus\non protecting\nenterprises and\ndevices from\nunauthorized access\nvia electronic means\nand, produce products\nand services that\nprotect enterprises,\nhomes and portable\ndevices from\nunauthorized access\nvia electronic means,\nor are a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain for such\nproducts and services.\nThe S&P Kensho Smart\nBorders Index seeks to\ntrack companies that\nproduce products and\nservices that secure\nborders and critical\ninfrastructure, or are\na necessary component\nof the supply chain\nfor such products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Robotics Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nto build robotic\nproducts and their\nsubsystems, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Drones Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nremotely-operated or\nunmanned aerial,\nunderwater and\nsurface-level drones\nmarket and related\nsubsystems, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Space Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nthat enable space\ntravel and\nexploration, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Wearables Index\nseeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nrelated to wearable\ntechnologies for\nconsumer, military or\nmedical uses, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Virtual Reality\nIndex seeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nrelated to virtual or\naugmented reality\nactivities, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. To determine\nthe constituents of\nthe Underlying\nIndexes, the Index\nProvider's\nclassification\nstandard utilizes an\nautomated scan of\ncompanies' most recent\nregulatory filings\nwith the U.S.\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission on\nForm 10-K, Form 20-F,\nForm 40-F, or S-1\nfiling and prospectus,\nas applicable, to\nidentify specific\nsearch terms and\nphrases that describe\na company as producing\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities\nfor each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered\nby eliminating\ncompanies that do not\ninclude in their\nregulatory filings a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and\n(ii) is used in a\nmanner that is within\nthe scope of the\nUnderlying Index's\nobjective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are\nnot listed on NYSE,\nNASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an\naffiliate of one of\nthose exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining\neligible constituent\nto verify the rules of\nthe automated scan\nwere implemented\ncorrectly. Underlying\nIndex constituents are\nthen categorized as\neither \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is\ncategorized as Core if\nits products and\nservices related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nregulatory filings as\nprincipal components\nof the company's\nstrategy. Products and\nservices are deemed to\nbe principal\ncomponents of a\ncompany's strategy if\nthe company's\nregulatory filing\ndisclosures regarding\nsuch products and\nservices are\ndetermined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on\nthe frequency and\nposition of such\ndisclosures within\nregulatory filings.\nAll other companies\nare categorized as\nNon-Core, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain of the\nsegment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index.\nAn Index constituent\ncategorized as Core by\nat least one of the\nUnderlying Indexes\nwill be categorized as\nCore for purposes of\nthe Index. To tilt the\nIndex's exposure\ntoward Core Index\nConstituents, at the\ntime of each rebalance\nthe aggregate\nweighting of Core\nIndex Constituents is\nbased on the\nproportion of the\nnumber of Core Index\nConstituents, plus an\noverweight factor of\nup to 20%. At the time\nof each rebalance,\neach Core Index\nConstituent and Non-\nCore Index Constituent\nis equally weighted\nwithin the group of\nCore Index\nConstituents and Non-\nCore Index\nConstituents,\nrespectively, subject\nto liquidity and\ndiversification\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, the Index\ncomprised 72\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. 192 Table of\nContents Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Aerospace and\nDefense Companies\nRisk: Aerospace and\ndefense companies can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\naerospace and defense\nregulation and\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely to a\nsignificant extent on\nU.S. (and other)\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets. Cybersecurity\nCompanies Risk:\nCompanies in the\ncybersecurity field\nface intense\ncompetition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally, which\nmay have an adverse\neffect on profit\nmargins. Cybersecurity\ncompanies may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets, financial\nresources or\npersonnel. The\nproducts of\ncybersecurity\ncompanies may face\nobsolescence due to\nrapid technological\ndevelopments and\nfrequent new product\nintroduction, and such\ncompanies may face\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates,\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel and\ncompetition from\nforeign competitors\nwith lower production\ncosts. Companies in\nthe cybersecurity\nfield are heavily\ndependent on patent\nand intellectual\nproperty rights. The\nloss or impairment of\nthese rights may\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In\ngeneral, cyber-attacks\nare deliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may\nresult in material\nadverse consequences\nfor such company, as\nwell as other\ncompanies included in\nthe Index, and may\ncause the Fund's\ninvestments to lose\nvalue. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. 193 Table of\nContents If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible\ntrade barriers,\ncurrency transfer\nrestrictions, a more\nlimited number of\npotential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\n194 Table of Contents\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. 195\n\nTable of Contents\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Kala O'Donnell is a Vice President of\nthe Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in\nthe Global Equity Beta Solutions Group. She\njoined the Adviser in 1995. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.45%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 58%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho Intelligent\nInfrastructure Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n198\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nof companies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide which are\nincluded in the\nIntelligent\nInfrastructure sector\nas determined by a\nclassification\nstandard produced by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d). The Index\nis designed to capture\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nbehind intelligent\ninfrastructure. In\nparticular, the Index\ncomprises the\ncomponents of the (i)\nS&P Kensho Smart Grids\nIndex focused on power\ngrid technologies\n(with an emphasis on\nefficient management\nand use of energy, and\nimproved power grid\nreliability),\ntransportation\ninfrastructure (with\nan emphasis on\nenhancing the\nefficiency of\ntransportation\ninfrastructure, as\nwell as the new\ninfrastructure\ncapabilities required\nfor alternative modes\nof transportation such\nas autonomous\nvehicles), and water\ninfrastructure (with\nan emphasis on water\nconversion and\nincreasing the water\nsupply), and (ii) the\nS&P Kensho Smart\nBuildings Index\nfocused on intelligent\nand connected home\ntechnologies and\nbuilding automation\ninfrastructure (the\n\u201cUnderlying Indexes\u201d)\nas of the Index's\nsemi-annual selection\ndate, on the first\nFriday in June and\nDecember, subject to\nthe following\nliquidity thresholds\nfor each component:\n(i) must be issued by\na company with a\nminimum float market\ncapitalization of at\nleast $100 million and\n(ii) must have a\nminimum three-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of at least $1\nmillion. The S&P\nKensho Smart Grids\nIndex seeks to track\ncompanies that provide\nnext generation\nproducts and services\nrelated to power,\nwater and\ntransportation\ninfrastructures, or\nare a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain for such\nproducts and services.\nThe S&P Kensho Smart\nBuildings Index seeks\nto track companies\nthat produce products\nand services that\nenable buildings to\nbecome more connected,\nintelligent and\nadaptive, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. To determine\nthe constituents of\nthe Underlying\nIndexes, the Index\nProvider's\nclassification\nstandard utilizes an\nautomated scan of\ncompanies' most recent\nregulatory filings\nwith the U.S.\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission on\nForm 10-K, Form 20-F,\nForm 40-F, or S-1\nfiling and prospectus,\nas applicable, to\nidentify specific\nsearch terms and\nphrases that describe\na company as producing\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities\nfor each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered\nby eliminating\ncompanies that do not\ninclude in their\nregulatory filings a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and\n(ii) is used in a\nmanner that is within\nthe scope of the\nUnderlying Index's\nobjective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are\nnot listed on NYSE,\nNASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an\naffiliate of one of\nthose exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining\neligible constituent\nto verify the rules of\nthe automated scan\nwere implemented\ncorrectly. Underlying\nIndex constituents are\nthen categorized as\neither \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is\ncategorized as Core if\nits products and\nservices related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nregulatory filings as\nprincipal components\nof the company's\nstrategy. Products and\nservices are deemed to\nbe principal\ncomponents of a\ncompany's strategy if\nthe company's\nregulatory filing\ndisclosures regarding\nsuch products and\nservices are\ndetermined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on\nthe frequency and\nposition of such\ndisclosures within\nregulatory filings.\nAll other companies\nare categorized as\nNon-Core, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain of the\nsegment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index.\nAn Index constituent\ncategorized as Core by\nat least one of the\nUnderlying Indexes\nwill be categorized as\nCore for purposes of\nthe Index. To tilt the\nIndex's exposure\ntoward Core Index\nConstituents, at the\ntime of each rebalance\nthe aggregate\nweighting of Core\nIndex Constituents is\nbased on the\nproportion of the\nnumber of Core Index\nConstituents, plus an\noverweight factor of\nup to 20%. At the time\nof each rebalance,\neach Core Index\nConstituent and Non-\nCore Index Constituent\nis equally weighted\nwithin the group of\nCore Index\nConstituents and Non-\nCore Index\nConstituents,\nrespectively, subject\nto liquidity and\ndiversification\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, the Index\ncomprised 54\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. 199\nTable of Contents\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Infrastructure-\nRelated Companies\nRisk: Infrastructure-\nrelated companies\ninclude companies that\nprimarily own, manage,\ndevelop and/or operate\ninfrastructure assets,\nincluding\ntransportation,\nutility, energy and/or\ntelecommunications\nassets. Investment in\ninfrastructure-related\nsecurities entails\nexposure to adverse\neconomic, regulatory,\npolitical, legal, and\nother conditions or\nevents affecting the\nissuers of such\nsecurities. Certain\ninfrastructure-related\nentities, particularly\ntelecommunications and\nutilities companies,\nare subject to\nextensive regulation\nby various\ngovernmental\nauthorities. The costs\nof complying with\ngovernmental\nregulations, delays or\nfailure to receive\nrequired regulatory\napprovals or the\nenactment of new\nadverse regulatory\nrequirements may\nadversely affect\ninfrastructure-related\ncompanies.\nInfrastructure-related\ncompanies may also be\naffected by service\ninterruption and/or\nlegal challenges due\nto environmental,\noperational or other\nconditions or events,\nand the imposition of\nspecial tariffs and\nchanges in tax laws,\nregulatory policies\nand accounting\nstandards.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In\ngeneral, cyber-attacks\nare deliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may\nresult in material\nadverse consequences\nfor such company, as\nwell as other\ncompanies included in\nthe Index, and may\ncause the Fund's\ninvestments to lose\nvalue. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. 200 Table\nof Contents Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible\ntrade barriers,\ncurrency transfer\nrestrictions, a more\nlimited number of\npotential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew 201 Table of\nContents key\nemployees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\n202\n\nTable of Contents\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nMark Krivitsky and Kala O'Donnell. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Mark Krivitsky is a Vice President of\nthe Adviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in\nthe Global Equity Beta Solutions Group and the\nTax-Efficient Market Capture Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 1996. Kala O'Donnell is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n1995. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price\n\n203\n\nTable of Contents greater than NAV (premium)\nor less than NAV (discount). When buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market,\nyou may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and\ndiscounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 67%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho New Economies\nComposite Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n205\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nof companies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide. The Index\nis designed to capture\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nand transforming the\nglobal economy through\nthe use of existing\nand emerging\ntechnologies, and\nrapid developments in\nrobotics, automation,\nartificial\nintelligence,\nconnectedness and\nprocessing power (\u201cNew\nEconomies companies\u201d).\nIn particular, the\nIndex comprises the\ncomponents included in\nthe New Economy\nSubsector Indexes\n(each, an \u201cUnderlying\nIndex\u201d) developed by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d).

As\nof July 31, 2021, the\nIndex was comprised of\n23 Underlying Indexes.\nThe constituents of\neach Underlying Index\nare determined by a\nclassification\nstandard produced by\nthe Index Provider.\nThe classification\nstandard utilizes an\nautomated scan of\ncompanies' most recent\nregulatory filings\nwith the U.S.\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission on\nForm 10-K, Form 20-F,\nForm 40-F, or S-1\nfiling and prospectus,\nas applicable, to\nidentify specific\nsearch terms and\nphrases that describe\na company as producing\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities\nfor each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered\nby eliminating\ncompanies that do not\ninclude in their\nregulatory filings a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and\n(ii) is used in a\nmanner that is within\nthe scope of the\nUnderlying Index's\nobjective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are\nnot listed on NYSE,\nNASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an\naffiliate of one of\nthose exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining\neligible constituent\nto verify the rules of\nthe automated scan\nwere implemented\ncorrectly. Underlying\nIndex constituents are\nthen categorized as\neither \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is\ncategorized as Core if\nits products and\nservices related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nregulatory filings as\nprincipal components\nof the company's\nstrategy. Products and\nservices are deemed to\nbe principal\ncomponents of a\ncompany's strategy if\nthe company's\nregulatory filing\ndisclosures regarding\nsuch products and\nservices are\ndetermined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on\nthe frequency and\nposition of such\ndisclosures within\nregulatory filings.\nAll other companies\nare categorized as\nNon-Core, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain of the\nsegment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index.\nEach Underlying\nIndex's exposure is\nthen tilted towards\nCore Index\nConstituents. The\nweight of each\nsecurity in the Index\nis based on the\nrelative weight given\nto each Underlying\nIndex in the Index.\nThe relative weight of\neach Underlying Index\nis determined by a\nproprietary process\ncomparing the ratio of\nthe average daily\nreturns divided by the\nstandard deviation of\ndaily returns among\nthe Underlying\nIndexes. Underlying\nIndexes with larger\nratios are weighted\nmore heavily than\nUnderlying Indexes\nwith smaller ratios.\nThe weight of each\nsecurity in each\nUnderlying Index is\nthen multiplied by the\nrelative weight of the\nrespective Underlying\nIndex in the Index to\ndetermine the\nsecurity's initial\nweight in the Index.\nThe final constituent\nsecurity weight is\nsubject to liquidity\nand diversification\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, the Index\ncomprised 494\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments. 206\nTable of Contents\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. New Economies\nCompanies Risk: The\ncompanies included in\nthe Index are engaged\nin emerging industries\nand new technologies\nthat may be unproven.\nSuch industries and\ntechnologies may be\nadversely affected by\ntechnological\nadvances, competition,\nrapid product or\nservice obsolescence,\nand new and evolving\nregulations. Companies\nincluded in the Index\nmay rely on a\ncombination of\npatents, copyrights,\ntrademarks and trade\nsecret laws to\nestablish and protect\ntheir proprietary\nrights in their\nproducts and\ntechnologies, and may\nbe adversely affected\nby loss or impairment\nof those rights. In\naddition, companies in\nthe Index may have\nlimited product lines,\nmarkets, financial\nresources or\npersonnel. The Index\nmay include stocks of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies that may be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In\ngeneral, cyber-attacks\nare deliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may\nresult in material\nadverse consequences\nfor such company, as\nwell as other\ncompanies included in\nthe Index, and may\ncause the Fund's\ninvestments to lose\nvalue. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible\ntrade barriers,\ncurrency transfer\nrestrictions, a more\nlimited number of\npotential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket 207 Table of\nContents country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nHealth Care Sector\nRisk: Companies in the\nhealth care sector are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernment regulation\nand their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of\nmedical products and\nservices, pricing\npressure (including\nprice discounting),\nlimited product lines\nand an increased\nemphasis on the\ndelivery of healthcare\nthrough outpatient\nservices. Companies in\nthe health care sector\nare heavily dependent\non obtaining and\ndefending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in\ntechnologies or other\nmarket developments.\nMany new products in\nthe health care sector\nrequire significant\nresearch and\ndevelopment and may be\nsubject to regulatory\napprovals, all of\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly\nwith no guarantee that\nany product will come\nto market. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\n208 Table of Contents\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\n209\n\nTable of Contents\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\nmay be subject to\ngreater fluctuation in\ntheir valuations from\none day to the next\nthan if market\nquotations were used.\nIn addition, there is\nno assurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(year ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 35.12% (Q4,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 21.32% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 6.39%.           \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n211\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF      \n  (the                                        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment         \n  results that,                               \n  before fees and expenses, correspond        \n  generally to                                \n  the total return performance of the S&P     \n  Kensho                                      \n  Smart Transportation Index.                 \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.45%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.45%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $46       $144    $252     $567  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 70%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nKensho Smart\nTransportation Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n212\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is comprised of\nU.S.-listed equity\nsecurities (including\ndepositary receipts)\nof companies domiciled\nacross developed and\nemerging markets\nworldwide which are\nincluded in the Smart\nTransportation sector\nas determined by a\nclassification\nstandard produced by\nS&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d). The Index\nis designed to capture\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare driving innovation\nbehind smart\ntransportation. In\nparticular, the Index\ncomprises the\ncomponents of the S&P\nKensho Autonomous\nVehicles Index, the\nS&P Kensho Advanced\nTransport Systems\nIndex, the S&P Kensho\nElectric Vehicles\nIndex and the\ncivilian/commercially\nfocused components of\nthe S&P Kensho Drones\nIndex (the \u201cUnderlying\nIndexes\u201d) as of the\nIndex's semi-annual\nselection date, on the\nfirst Friday in June\nand December, subject\nto the following\nliquidity thresholds\nfor each component:\n(i) must be issued by\na company with a\nminimum float market\ncapitalization of at\nleast $100 million and\n(ii) must have a\nminimum three-month\naverage daily traded\nvalue of at least $1\nmillion. The S&P\nKensho Autonomous\nVehicles Index seeks\nto track companies\nthat build autonomous\nand connected vehicles\nand that provide the\nproducts and services\nthat enable these\nvehicles to become\nmore efficient and\nintelligent, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Advanced\nTransport Systems\nIndex seeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nthat optimize the\nefficiency of managing\nlarge fleets of\nvehicles, cargo\ntransportation, and\nmass transit, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. The S&P\nKensho Electric\nVehicles Index seeks\nto track companies\nthat produce products\nand services related\nto the development of\nelectric vehicles,\nclean fuel systems,\nand related systems,\nor are a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain for such\nproducts and services.\nThe S&P Kensho Drones\nIndex seeks to track\ncompanies that produce\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nremotely-operated or\nunmanned aerial,\nunderwater and\nsurface-level drones\nmarket and related\nsubsystems, or are a\nnecessary component of\nthe supply chain for\nsuch products and\nservices. To determine\nthe constituents of\nthe Underlying\nIndexes, the Index\nProvider's\nclassification\nstandard utilizes an\nautomated scan of\ncompanies' most recent\nregulatory filings\nwith the U.S.\nSecurities and\nExchange Commission on\nForm 10-K, Form 20-F,\nForm 40-F, or S-1\nfiling and prospectus,\nas applicable, to\nidentify specific\nsearch terms and\nphrases that describe\na company as producing\nproducts and services\nrelated to the\nparticular segment\ntargeted by the\nUnderlying Index. The\nresulting list of\neligible securities\nfor each Underlying\nIndex is then filtered\nby eliminating\ncompanies that do not\ninclude in their\nregulatory filings a\nreference to a product\nor service that (i) is\nrelated to a search\nterm or phrase and\n(ii) is used in a\nmanner that is within\nthe scope of the\nUnderlying Index's\nobjective. Each\nUnderlying Index then\nscreens the remaining\nsecurities to remove\nsecurities that are\nnot listed on NYSE,\nNASDAQ, or CBOE\nexchanges (or an\naffiliate of one of\nthose exchanges) or do\nnot meet certain\nminimum liquidity\nthresholds. The Index\nProvider's Index\nCommittee then reviews\neach remaining\neligible constituent\nto verify the rules of\nthe automated scan\nwere implemented\ncorrectly. Underlying\nIndex constituents are\nthen categorized as\neither \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon-\nCore.\u201d A company is\ncategorized as Core if\nits products and\nservices related to\nthe Underlying Index's\nobjective are\nidentified in its\nregulatory filings as\nprincipal components\nof the company's\nstrategy. Products and\nservices are deemed to\nbe principal\ncomponents of a\ncompany's strategy if\nthe company's\nregulatory filing\ndisclosures regarding\nsuch products and\nservices are\ndetermined to be\nsufficiently prominent\naccording to a\nproprietary algorithm\nof the Index Provider\nwhich calculates\nprominence based on\nthe frequency and\nposition of such\ndisclosures within\nregulatory filings.\nAll other companies\nare categorized as\nNon-Core, including\ncompanies whose\nproducts and services\nare identified as\nforming a necessary\ncomponent of the\nsupply chain of the\nsegment targeted by\nthe Underlying Index.\nAn Index constituent\ncategorized as Core by\nat least one of the\nUnderlying Indexes\nwill be categorized as\nCore for purposes of\nthe Index. To tilt the\nIndex's exposure\ntoward Core Index\nConstituents, at the\ntime of each rebalance\nthe aggregate\nweighting of Core\nIndex Constituents is\nbased on the\nproportion of the\nnumber of Core Index\nConstituents, plus an\noverweight factor of\nup to 20%. At the time\nof each rebalance,\neach Core Index\nConstituent and Non-\nCore Index Constituent\nis equally weighted\nwithin the group of\nCore Index\nConstituents and Non-\nCore Index\nConstituents,\nrespectively, subject\nto liquidity\nadjustments. The Index\nis rebalanced semi-\nannually on the third\nFriday of June and\nDecember. As of July\n31, 2021, the Index\ncomprised 80\nsecurities. The Index\nProvider is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth 213 Table of\nContents or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Transportation\nCompanies Risk:\nTransportation\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices,\nlabor relations,\ntechnology\ndevelopments, exchange\nrates, insurance\ncosts, industry\ncompetition and\ngovernment regulation.\nCybersecurity-Related\nRisk: The companies\nincluded in the Index\nrely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet\nand depend on computer\nsystems to perform\nbusiness and\noperational functions,\nand therefore may be\nprone to operational\nand information\nsecurity risks\nresulting from cyber-\nattacks and/or\ntechnological\nmalfunctions. Cyber-\nattacks include, among\nothers, stealing or\ncorrupting data\nmaintained online or\ndigitally, preventing\nlegitimate users from\naccessing information\nor services on a\nwebsite, releasing\nconfidential\ninformation without\nauthorization, and\ncausing operational\ndisruption. In\ngeneral, cyber-attacks\nare deliberate, but\nunintentional events\nmay have similar\neffects. Successful\ncyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns\nof, a company included\nin the Index may\nresult in material\nadverse consequences\nfor such company, as\nwell as other\ncompanies included in\nthe Index, and may\ncause the Fund's\ninvestments to lose\nvalue. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector\nRisk: The success of\nconsumer product\nmanufacturers and\nretailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDepositary Receipts\nRisk: Investments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying securities\nin their primary\ntrading market. If a\ndepositary receipt is\ndenominated in a\ndifferent currency\nthan its underlying\nsecurities, the Fund\nwill be subject to the\ncurrency risk of both\nthe investment in the\ndepositary receipt and\nthe underlying\nsecurity. Holders of\ndepositary receipts\nmay have limited or no\nrights to take action\nwith respect to the\nunderlying securities\nor to compel the\nissuer of the receipts\nto take action. The\nprices of depositary\nreceipts may differ\nfrom the prices of\nsecurities upon which\nthey are based. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in depositary\nreceipts based on\nsecurities included in\nthe Index, such\ndifferences in prices\nmay increase index\ntracking risk.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a 214\nTable of Contents\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Emerging\nMarkets Risk: Risks of\ninvesting in emerging\nmarkets include, among\nothers, greater\npolitical and economic\ninstability, greater\nvolatility in currency\nexchange rates, less\ndeveloped securities\nmarkets, possible\ntrade barriers,\ncurrency transfer\nrestrictions, a more\nlimited number of\npotential buyers and\nissuers, an emerging\nmarket country's\ndependence on revenue\nfrom particular\ncommodities or\ninternational aid,\nless governmental\nsupervision and\nregulation,\nunavailability of\ncurrency hedging\ntechniques,\ndifferences in\nauditing and financial\nreporting standards,\nand less developed\nlegal systems. There\nis also the potential\nfor unfavorable action\nsuch as expropriation,\nnationalization,\nembargo, and acts of\nwar. The securities of\nemerging market\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Market\ndisruptions or\nsubstantial market\ncorrections may limit\nvery significantly the\nliquidity of\nsecurities of certain\ncompanies in a\nparticular country or\ngeographic region, or\nof all companies in\nthe country or region.\nThe Fund may be unable\nto liquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nThese risks are\ngenerally greater for\ninvestments in\nfrontier market\ncountries, which\ntypically have smaller\neconomies or less\ndeveloped capital\nmarkets than\ntraditional emerging\nmarket countries.\nIndexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLarge-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. 215\nTable of Contents Mid-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of mid-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of mid-\nsized companies may\ntrade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes\nthan more widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of mid-\nsized issuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may be\nvolatile. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities\n(including depositary\nreceipts) are subject\nto political,\nregulatory, and\neconomic risks not\npresent in domestic\ninvestments. There may\nbe less information\npublicly available\nabout a non-U.S.\nentity than about a\nU.S. entity, and many\nnon-U.S. entities are\nnot subject to\naccounting, auditing,\nlegal and financial\nreport standards\ncomparable to those in\nthe United States.\nFurther, such entities\nand/or their\nsecurities may be\nsubject to risks\nassociated with\ncurrency controls;\nexpropriation; changes\nin tax policy; greater\nmarket volatility;\ndiffering securities\nmarket structures;\nhigher transaction\ncosts; and various\nadministrative\ndifficulties, such as\ndelays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio\ntransactions or in\nreceiving payment of\ndividends. To the\nextent underlying\nsecurities held by the\nFund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are\nclosed when the\nexchange on which the\nFund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be\ndeviations between the\ncurrent price of an\nunderlying security\nand the last quoted\nprice for the\nunderlying security on\nthe closed foreign\nmarket. These\ndeviations could\nresult in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums\nor discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs\nthat invest in\ndomestic securities.\nSecurities traded on\nforeign markets may be\nless liquid (harder to\nsell) than securities\ntraded domestically.\nForeign governments\nmay impose\nrestrictions on the\nrepatriation of\ncapital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the\nextent that the Fund\nbuys securities\ndenominated in a\nforeign currency,\nthere are special\nrisks such as changes\nin currency exchange\nrates and the risk\nthat a foreign\ngovernment could\nregulate foreign\nexchange transactions.\nIn addition, to the\nextent investments are\nmade in a limited\nnumber of countries,\nevents in those\ncountries will have a\nmore significant\nimpact on the Fund.\nInvestments in\ndepositary receipts\nmay be less liquid and\nmore volatile than the\nunderlying shares in\ntheir primary trading\nmarket. Small-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk: The\nsecurities of small-\ncapitalization\ncompanies may be more\nvolatile and may\ninvolve more risk than\nthe securities of\nlarger companies.\nThese companies may\nhave limited product\nlines, markets or\nfinancial resources,\nmay lack the\ncompetitive strength\nof larger companies,\nand may depend on a\nfew key employees. In\naddition, these\ncompanies may have\nbeen recently\norganized and may have\nlittle or no track\nrecord of success. The\nsecurities of smaller\ncompanies may trade\nless frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than\nmore widely held\nsecurities. Some\nsecurities of smaller\nissuers may be\nilliquid or may be\nrestricted as to\nresale, and their\nvalues may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. The Fund\nmay be unable to\nliquidate its\npositions in such\nsecurities at any\ntime, or at a\nfavorable price, in\norder to meet the\nFund's obligations.\nReturns on investments\nin securities of\nsmall-capitalization\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of larger\ncompanies. Technology\nSector Risk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nValuation Risk: Some\nportfolio holdings,\npotentially a large\nportion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio,\nmay be valued on the\nbasis of factors other\nthan market\nquotations. This may\noccur more often in\ntimes of market\nturmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that\ncan be used to value a\nportfolio holding when\nmarket quotations are\nnot readily available.\nThe value established\nfor any portfolio\nholding at a point in\ntime might differ from\nwhat would be produced\nusing a different\nmethodology or if it\nhad been priced using\nmarket quotations.\nPortfolio holdings\nthat are valued using\ntechniques other than\nmarket quotations,\nincluding \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities,\n216\n\nTable of Contents may\nbe subject to greater\nfluctuation in their\nvaluations from one\nday to the next than\nif market quotations\nwere used. In\naddition, there is no\nassurance that the\nFund could sell or\nclose out a portfolio\nposition for the value\nestablished for it at\nany time, and it is\npossible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio\nposition is sold or\nclosed out at a\ndiscount to the\nvaluation established\nby the Fund at that\ntime.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash.\n\n217\n\nTable of Contents Individual Fund Shares may\nonly be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca,\nInc., other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other\nalternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 44%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nMetals & Mining Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n219\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex represents the\nmetals and mining\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nmetals & mining\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries: Aluminum,\nCoal & Consumable\nFuels, Copper,\nDiversified Metals &\nMining, Gold, Precious\nMetals & Minerals,\nSilver, and Steel. The\nIndex is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the\nperformance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nAluminum, Coal &\nConsumable Fuels,\nCopper, Diversified\nMetals & Mining, Gold,\nPrecious Metals &\nMinerals, Silver, and\nSteel sub-industries\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria:\n(i) have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 30\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Metals and\nMining Companies Risk:\nMetals and mining\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby events relating to\ninternational\npolitical and economic\ndevelopments, energy\nconservation, the\nsuccess of exploration\nprojects, commodity\nprices, and tax and\nother government\nregulations.\nInvestments in metals\nand mining companies\nmay be speculative and\nmay be subject to\ngreater price\nvolatility than\ninvestments in other\ntypes of companies.\nRisks of metals and\nmining investments\ninclude: changes in\ninternational monetary\npolicies or economic\nand political\nconditions that can\naffect the supply of\nprecious metals and\nconsequently the value\nof metals and mining\ncompany investments;\nthe United States or\nforeign governments\nmay pass laws or\nregulations limiting\nmetals investments for\nstrategic or other\npolicy reasons; and\nincreased\nenvironmental or labor\ncosts may depress the\nvalue of metals and\nmining investments.\n220 Table of Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector.\nMaterials Sector Risk:\nMany materials\ncompanies are\nsignificantly affected\nby the level and\nvolatility of\ncommodity prices,\nexchange rates, import\ncontrols, worldwide\ncompetition,\nenvironmental policies\nand consumer demand.\nAt times, worldwide\nproduction of\nindustrial materials\nhas exceeded demand as\na result of over-\nbuilding or economic\ndownturns, leading to\npoor investment\nreturns or losses.\nOther risks may\ninclude liabilities\nfor environmental\ndamage and general\ncivil liabilities,\ndepletion of\nresources, and\nmandated expenditures\nfor safety and\npollution control. The\nmaterials sector may\nalso be affected by\neconomic cycles,\ntechnical progress,\nlabor relations, and\ngovernment\nregulations. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\n221\n\nTable of Contents\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 44.32% (Q4,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 44.48% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 25.43%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Raymond Donofrio. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Raymond\nDonofrio is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Global\nEquity Beta Solutions Group. He joined the\nAdviser in 2008. Purchase and Sale Information\nThe Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically\nmarket makers or other broker-dealers) only in\nlarge blocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price\n\n222\n\nTable of Contents greater than NAV (premium)\nor less than NAV (discount). When buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market,\nyou may incur costs attributable to the\ndifference between the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares\n(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask\nspread\u201d). Recent information regarding the\nFund's NAV, market price, premiums and\ndiscounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 64%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nOil & Gas Equipment &\nServices Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n224\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the oil and\ngas equipment and\nservices segment of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The oil\nand gas equipment and\nservices segment of\nthe S&P TMI comprises\nthe Oil & Gas Drilling\nsub-industry and the\nOil & Gas Equipment &\nServices sub-industry.\nThe Index is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the\nperformance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the Oil &\nGas Drilling sub-\nindustry and the Oil &\nGas Equipment &\nServices sub-industry\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria:\n(i) have a float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month.

The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 27\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Oil and Gas\nCompanies Risk: Oil\nand gas companies\ndevelop and produce\ncrude oil and natural\ngas and provide\ndrilling and other\nenergy resources\nproduction and\ndistribution related\nservices. Stock prices\nfor these types of\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their\nspecific product or\nservice and for energy\nproducts in general.\nThe price of oil and\ngas, exploration and\nproduction spending,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions\nwill likewise affect\nthe performance of\nthese companies.\nCorrespondingly,\nsecurities of\ncompanies in the\nenergy field are\nsubject to swift price\nand supply\nfluctuations caused by\nevents relating to\ninternational\npolitics, energy\nconservation, the\nsuccess of exploration\nprojects, and tax and\nother governmental\nregulatory policies.\nWeak demand for the\ncompanies' products or\nservices or for energy\nproducts and services\nin 225 Table of\nContents general, as\nwell as negative\ndevelopments in these\nother areas, would\nadversely impact the\nFund's performance.\nOil and gas equipment\nand services can be\nsignificantly affected\nby natural disasters\nas well as changes in\nexchange rates,\ninterest rates,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions.\nThese companies may be\nat risk for\nenvironmental damage\nclaims. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Energy\nSector Risk: Issuers\nin energy-related\nindustries can be\nsignificantly affected\nby fluctuations in\nenergy prices and\nsupply and demand of\nenergy fuels. Markets\nfor various energy-\nrelated commodities\ncan have significant\nvolatility, and are\nsubject to control or\nmanipulation by large\nproducers or\npurchasers. Companies\nin the energy sector\nmay need to make\nsubstantial\nexpenditures, and to\nincur significant\namounts of debt, in\norder to maintain or\nexpand their reserves.\nOil and gas\nexploration and\nproduction can be\nsignificantly affected\nby natural disasters\nas well as changes in\nexchange rates,\ninterest rates,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions.\nThese companies may be\nat risk for\nenvironmental damage\nclaims. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to 226\n\nTable of Contents\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 60.70% (Q4,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 71.56% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 23.26%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                              \n                   One      Five     Ten      \n                   Year     Years    Years    \n  Return Before    -43.47%  -22.87%  -18.01%  \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on         -43.77%  -23.14%  -18.27%  \n  Distributions                               \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributions    -25.69%  -14.77%  -9.96%   \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P Oil & Gas                               \n  Equipment &                                 \n  Services Select                             \n  Industry                                    \n  Index (reflects  -43.39%  -22.72%  -17.90%  \n  no deduction                                \n  for fees,                                   \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for    18.40%   15.22%   13.88%   \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Melissa Kapitulik. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010.

Melissa\nKapitulik is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Senior Portfolio Manager in the Global\nEquity Beta Solutions Group. She joined the\nAdviser in 2006.\n\n227\n\nTable of Contents Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n228\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P \u00aeOil & Gas Exploration & Production\nETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration &        \n  Production                                  \n  ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide           \n  investment                                  \n  results that, before fees and expenses,     \n  correspond                                  \n  generally to the total return performance   \n  of an                                       \n  index derived from the oil and gas          \n  exploration and                             \n  production segment of a U.S. total market   \n  composite index.                            \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 71%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nOil & Gas Exploration\n& Production Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n229\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the oil and\ngas exploration and\nproduction segment of\nthe S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The\nS&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The oil\nand gas exploration\nand production segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries: Integrated\nOil & Gas, Oil & Gas\nExploration &\nProduction, and Oil &\nGas Refining &\nMarketing. The Index\nis one of twenty-one\n(21) of the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nIntegrated Oil & Gas,\nOil & Gas Exploration\n& Production, and Oil\n& Gas Refining &\nMarketing sub-\nindustries that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 54\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Oil and Gas\nCompanies Risk: Oil\nand gas companies\ndevelop and produce\ncrude oil and natural\ngas and provide\ndrilling and other\nenergy resources\nproduction and\ndistribution related\nservices. Stock prices\nfor these types of\ncompanies are affected\nby supply and demand\nboth for their\nspecific product or\nservice and for energy\nproducts in general.\nThe price of oil and\ngas, exploration and\nproduction spending,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions\nwill likewise affect\nthe performance of\nthese companies.\nCorrespondingly,\nsecurities of\ncompanies in the\nenergy field are\nsubject to swift price\nand supply\nfluctuations caused by\nevents relating to\ninternational\npolitics, energy\nconservation, the\nsuccess of exploration\nprojects, and tax and\nother governmental\nregulatory policies.\nWeak demand for the\ncompanies' products or\nservices or for energy\nproducts and services\nin 230 Table of\nContents general, as\nwell as negative\ndevelopments in these\nother areas, would\nadversely impact the\nFund's performance.\nOil and gas\nexploration and\nproduction can be\nsignificantly affected\nby natural disasters\nas well as changes in\nexchange rates,\ninterest rates,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions.\nThese companies may be\nat risk for\nenvironmental damage\nclaims. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Energy\nSector Risk: Issuers\nin energy-related\nindustries can be\nsignificantly affected\nby fluctuations in\nenergy prices and\nsupply and demand of\nenergy fuels. Markets\nfor various energy-\nrelated commodities\ncan have significant\nvolatility, and are\nsubject to control or\nmanipulation by large\nproducers or\npurchasers. Companies\nin the energy sector\nmay need to make\nsubstantial\nexpenditures, and to\nincur significant\namounts of debt, in\norder to maintain or\nexpand their reserves.\nOil and gas\nexploration and\nproduction can be\nsignificantly affected\nby natural disasters\nas well as changes in\nexchange rates,\ninterest rates,\ngovernment regulation,\nworld events and\neconomic conditions.\nThese companies may be\nat risk for\nenvironmental damage\nclaims. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to 231\n\nTable of Contents\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 59.65% (Q2,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 64.97% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return was 67.33%.          \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes.

After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.\n                                              \n                   One      Five     Ten      \n                   Year     Years    Years    \n  Return Before    -36.50%  -12.32%  -10.90%  \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on         -36.99%  -12.62%  -11.20%  \n  Distributions                               \n  Return After                                \n  Taxes on                                    \n  Distributions    -21.46%  -8.67%   -6.96%   \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P Oil & Gas                               \n  Exploration &                               \n  Production                                  \n  Select                                      \n  Industry Index   -36.58%  -12.14%  -10.82%  \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for                               \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for    18.40%   15.22%   13.88%   \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or                                 \n  taxes)                                      \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.

Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997.

She joined the Adviser\nin 2007.\n\n232\n\nTable of Contents Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n233\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P \u00aePharmaceuticals ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF (the       \n  \u201cFund\u201d)                                     \n  seeks to provide investment results that,   \n  before                                      \n  fees and expenses, correspond generally to  \n  the                                         \n  total return performance of an index        \n  derived from                                \n  the pharmaceuticals segment of a U.S.       \n  total market                                \n  composite index.                            \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d). You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 53%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nPharmaceuticals Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n234\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\npharmaceuticals\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\npharmaceuticals\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nPharmaceuticals sub-\nindustry. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nPharmaceuticals sub-\nindustry that satisfy\nthe following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 48\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Pharmaceuticals\nCompanies Risk:\nPharmaceutical\ncompanies are heavily\ndependent on patent\nprotection. The\nexpiration of patents\nmay adversely affect\nthe profitability of\nthe companies.\nPharmaceutical\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nother similar claims.\nMany new products are\nsubject to approval of\nthe U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration\n(\u201cFDA\u201d). The process\nof obtaining FDA\napproval can be long\nand costly and\napproved products are\nsusceptible to\nobsolescence.\nPharmaceutical\ncompanies are also\nsubject to heavy\ncompetitive forces\nthat may make it\ndifficult to raise\nprices and, in fact,\nmay result in price\ndiscounting. 235 Table\nof Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Health\nCare Sector Risk:\nCompanies in the\nhealth care sector are\nsubject to extensive\ngovernment regulation\nand their\nprofitability can be\nsignificantly affected\nby restrictions on\ngovernment\nreimbursement for\nmedical expenses,\nrising costs of\nmedical products and\nservices, pricing\npressure (including\nprice discounting),\nlimited product lines\nand an increased\nemphasis on the\ndelivery of healthcare\nthrough outpatient\nservices. Companies in\nthe health care sector\nare heavily dependent\non obtaining and\ndefending patents,\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly,\nand the expiration of\npatents may also\nadversely affect the\nprofitability of these\ncompanies. Health care\ncompanies are also\nsubject to extensive\nlitigation based on\nproduct liability and\nsimilar claims. In\naddition, their\nproducts can become\nobsolete due to\nindustry innovation,\nchanges in\ntechnologies or other\nmarket developments.\nMany new products in\nthe health care sector\nrequire significant\nresearch and\ndevelopment and may be\nsubject to regulatory\napprovals, all of\nwhich may be time\nconsuming and costly\nwith no guarantee that\nany product will come\nto market. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to 236\n\nTable of Contents\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 50%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nRegional Banks Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n239\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\nregional banks segment\nof the S&P Total\nMarket Index (\u201cS&P\nTMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the\nbroad U.S. equity\nmarket. The regional\nbanks segment of the\nS&P TMI comprises the\nRegional Banks sub-\nindustry. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nRegional Banks sub-\nindustry that satisfy\nthe following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The S&\nP TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 130\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Banking\nCompanies Risk: The\nperformance of bank\nstocks may be affected\nby extensive\ngovernmental\nregulation which may\nlimit both the amounts\nand types of loans and\nother financial\ncommitments they can\nmake, and the interest\nrates and fees they\ncan charge and the\namount of capital they\nmust maintain.\nProfitability is\nlargely dependent on\nthe availability and\ncost of capital funds,\nand can fluctuate\nsignificantly when\ninterest rates change.\nCredit losses\nresulting from\nfinancial difficulties\nof borrowers can\nnegatively impact\nbanking companies.\nBanks may also be\nsubject to severe\nprice competition.\nCompetition is high\namong banking\ncompanies and failure\nto maintain or\nincrease market share\nmay result in lost\nmarket value. 240\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Institutions\nRisk: Changes in the\ncreditworthiness of\nfinancial institutions\n(such as banks and\nbroker-dealers) may\nadversely affect the\nvalues of instruments\nof issuers in\nfinancial industries.\nAdverse developments\nin banking and other\nfinancial industries\nmay cause the Fund to\nunderperform relative\nto other funds that\ninvest more broadly\nacross different\nindustries or have a\nsmaller exposure to\nfinancial\ninstitutions. Changes\nin governmental\nregulation and\noversight of financial\ninstitutions may have\nan adverse effect on\nthe financial\ncondition of a\nfinancial institution.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more 241\n\nTable of Contents\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index. The\nFund's past\nperformance (before\nand after taxes) is\nnot necessarily an\nindication of how the\nFund will perform in\nthe future.Updated\nperformance\ninformation is\navailable by calling\n1-866-787-2257or\nvisiting our website\nat https://www.ssga.co\nm/spdrs.\n\nAnnual Total Returns\n(years ended 12/31)*\nHighest Quarterly\nReturn: 46.60% (Q4,\n2020)\nLowest Quarterly\nReturn:- 43.46% (Q1,\n2020)\n                                              \n  *  As of\u2005 9/30/2021, the Fund's Calendar    \n     Year-To-Date return \u00a0was 32.29%.         \n                                              \nAverage Annual Total Returns (for periods\nended 12/31/20) The after-tax returns\npresented in the table below are calculated\nusing highest historical individual federal\nmarginal income tax rates and do not reflect\nthe impact of state and local taxes. Your\nactual after-tax returns will depend on your\nspecific tax situation and may differ from\nthose shown below. After-tax returns are not\nrelevant to investors who hold Fund Shares\nthrough tax-advantaged arrangements, such as\n401(k) plans or individual retirement\naccounts. The returns after taxes can exceed\nthe returns before taxes due to an assumed tax\nbenefit for a shareholder from realizing a\ncapital loss on a sale of Fund\nShares.Effective October 24, 2011 (the\n\u201cBenchmark Index Change Date\u201d), the Fund's\nbenchmark index changed from the KBW Regional\nBanking Index (the \u201cPrevious Benchmark Index\u201d)\nto the S&P Regional Banks Select Industry\nIndex, consistent with a change in the Fund's\nprincipal investment strategy to track the\nperformance of the current index. Performance\nof the Fund prior to the Benchmark Index\nChange Date is therefore based on the Fund's\ninvestment strategy to track the Previous\nBenchmark Index and may have been different\nhad the Fund tracked the current index.\n                                              \n                      One     Five    Ten     \n                      Year    Years   Years   \n  Return Before       -7.41%  6.76%   9.19%   \n  Taxes                                       \n  Return After Taxes  -8.30%  6.16%   8.68%   \n  on Distributions                            \n  Return After Taxes                          \n  on Distributions    -4.16%  5.19%   7.44%   \n  and Sale of                                 \n  Fund Shares                                 \n  S&P Regional Banks                          \n  Select Industry                             \n  Index/KBW                                   \n  Regional Banking    -7.10%  7.08%   9.58%   \n  Index1 (reflects                            \n  no deduction for                            \n  fees, expenses or                           \n  taxes)                                      \n  S&P 500 Index                               \n  (reflects no                                \n  deduction for       18.40%  15.22%  13.88%  \n  fees,                                       \n  expenses or taxes)                          \n                                              \n                                              \n     Returns shown are reflective of the      \n     Index for periods beginning on the       \n  1  Benchmark Index Change Date and the      \n     Previous Benchmark Index for periods     \n     prior to the Benchmark Index Change      \n     Date.                                    \n                                              \nPortfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA\nFM serves as the investment adviser to the\nFund.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n243\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeS&P Retail ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks  \n  to                                          \n  provide investment results that, before     \n  fees and                                    \n  expenses, correspond generally to the       \n  total return                                \n  performance of an index derived from the    \n  retail                                      \n  segment of a U.S. total market composite    \n  index.                                      \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 62%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nRetail Select Industry\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n244\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the retail\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nretail segment of the\nS&P TMI comprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries: Apparel\nRetail, Automotive\nRetail, Computer &\nElectronic Retail,\nDepartment Stores,\nDrug Retail, Food\nRetailers, General\nMerchandise Stores,\nHypermarkets & Super\nCenters, Internet &\nDirect Marketing\nRetail, and Specialty\nStores. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nApparel Retail,\nAutomotive Retail,\nComputer & Electronic\nRetail, Department\nStores, Drug Retail,\nFood Retailers,\nGeneral Merchandise\nStores, Hypermarkets &\nSuper Centers,\nInternet & Direct\nMarketing Retail, and\nSpecialty Stores sub-\nindustries that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 106\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Retail Companies\nRisk: Retail companies\ncan be significantly\naffected by the\nperformance of the\ndomestic and\ninternational economy,\nconsumer confidence\nand spending, intense\ncompetition, changes\nin demographics, and\nchanging consumer\ntastes and\npreferences. 245 Table\nof Contents\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector\nRisk: The success of\nconsumer product\nmanufacturers and\nretailers is tied\nclosely to the\nperformance of the\noverall global\neconomy, interest\nrates, competition and\nconsumer confidence.\nSuccess depends\nheavily on disposable\nhousehold income and\nconsumer spending.\nAlso, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary\nsector may be subject\nto severe competition,\nwhich may have an\nadverse impact on\ntheir respective\nprofitability. Changes\nin demographics and\nconsumer tastes can\nalso affect the demand\nfor, and success of,\nconsumer products and\nservices in the\nmarketplace. Consumer\nStaples Sector Risk:\nConsumer staples\ncompanies are subject\nto government\nregulation affecting\ntheir products which\nmay negatively impact\nsuch companies'\nperformance. For\ninstance, government\nregulations may affect\nthe permissibility of\nusing various food\nadditives and\nproduction methods of\ncompanies that make\nfood products, which\ncould affect company\nprofitability. Tobacco\ncompanies may be\nadversely affected by\nthe adoption of\nproposed legislation\nand/or by litigation.\nAlso, the success of\nfood, beverage,\nhousehold and personal\nproduct companies may\nbe strongly affected\nby consumer interest,\nmarketing campaigns\nand other factors\naffecting supply and\ndemand, including\nperformance of the\noverall domestic and\nglobal economy,\ninterest rates,\ncompetition and\nconsumer confidence\nand spending.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. 246\n\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

He joined the Adviser in\n2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 32%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSemiconductor Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n249\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\nsemiconductors segment\nof the S&P Total\nMarket Index (\u201cS&P\nTMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the\nbroad U.S. equity\nmarket. The\nsemiconductors segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nSemiconductors sub-\nindustry. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nSemiconductors sub-\nindustry that satisfy\nthe following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nIf there are fewer\nthan 35 stocks, stocks\nfrom the Semiconductor\nEquipment sub-industry\nthat meet the market\ncapitalization and\nliquidity thresholds\nare included in order\nof their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization from\nlargest to smallest.\nIf there continues to\nbe fewer than 22\nstocks, the market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 41\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Semiconductor\nCompanies Risk: The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting\nsemiconductor\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\nsemiconductor\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology\nis particularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in product\ncycles, rapid product\nobsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nSemiconductor\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\n250 Table of Contents\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nAdditionally,\nsemiconductor\ncompanies may face\ndramatic and often\nunpredictable changes\nin growth rates and\ncompetition for the\nservices of qualified\npersonnel. Fluctuation\nof Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and\nDiscounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-\ntraded funds, Fund\nShares may be bought\nand sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). 251\n\nTable of Contents\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 40%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nSoftware & Services\nSelect Industry Index\n(the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n254\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\nsoftware and services\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\nsoftware and services\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries:\nApplication Software,\nData Processing &\nOutsourced Services,\nInteractive Home\nEntertainment, IT\nConsulting & Other\nServices, and Systems\nSoftware. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure\nthe performance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the\nApplication Software,\nData Processing &\nOutsourced Services,\nInteractive Home\nEntertainment, IT\nConsulting & Other\nServices, and Systems\nSoftware sub-\nindustries that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 184\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Computer\nSoftware/Services\nCompanies Risk:\nComputer\nsoftware/services\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby competitive\npressures, aggressive\npricing, technological\ndevelopments, changing\ndomestic demand, the\nability to attract and\nretain skilled\nemployees and\navailability and price\nof components. The\nmarket for products\nproduced by computer\nsoftware/services\ncompanies is\ncharacterized by\nrapidly changing\ntechnology, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ncyclical market\npatterns, evolving\nindustry standards and\nfrequent new product\nintroductions. The\nsuccess of computer\nsoftware/services\ncompanies depends in\nsubstantial part on\nthe timely and\nsuccessful\nintroduction of new\nproducts and the\nability to service\nsuch products. An\nunexpected change in\none or more of the 255\nTable of Contents\ntechnologies affecting\nan issuer's products\nor in the market for\nproducts based on a\nparticular technology\ncould have a material\nadverse effect on a\nparticipant's\noperating results.\nMany computer\nsoftware/services\ncompanies rely on a\ncombination of\npatents, copyrights,\ntrademarks and trade\nsecret laws to\nestablish and protect\ntheir proprietary\nrights in their\nproducts and\ntechnologies. There\ncan be no assurance\nthat the steps taken\nby computer\nsoftware/services\ncompanies to protect\ntheir proprietary\nrights will be\nadequate to prevent\nmisappropriation of\ntheir technology or\nthat competitors will\nnot independently\ndevelop technologies\nthat are substantially\nequivalent or superior\nto such companies'\ntechnology.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready\nmarket, stressed\nmarket conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. 256\n\nTable of Contents Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The\nFund pays transaction\ncosts, such as\ncommissions, when it\nbuys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio). A\nhigher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected\nin Annual Fund\nOperating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect\nthe Fund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate\nwas 61% of the average\nvalue of its portfolio.\nThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nTelecom Select Industry\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required to\npurchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the Index\nin an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities\nwith generally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size of\nthe Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA\nFM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser\nto the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index\nor may invest the\nFund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions as\nthe Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended;\nhowever, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund may\ninvest in equity\nsecurities that are not\nincluded in the Index,\ncash and cash\nequivalents or money\nmarket instruments,\nsuch as repurchase\nagreements and money\nmarket funds (including\nmoney market funds\nadvised by the\nAdviser). In seeking to\ntrack the\n\n259\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only to\nthe extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a\nparticular industry or\ngroup of industries.\nFutures contracts (a\ntype of derivative\ninstrument) may be used\nby the Fund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\ntelecommunications\nsegment of the S&P\nTotal Market Index\n(\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P\nTMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S.\nequity market. The\ntelecommunications\nsegment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the following\nsub-industries:\nAlternative Carriers,\nCommunications\nEquipment, Integrated\nTelecommunication\nServices, and Wireless\nTelecommunication\nServices. The Index is\none of twenty-one (21)\nof the S&P Select\nIndustry Indices (the\n\u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each\ndesigned to measure the\nperformance of a narrow\nsub-industry or group\nof sub-industries\ndetermined based on the\nGlobal Industry\nClassification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in\nthe Select Industry\nIndices is based on the\nGICS classification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements. Companies\nin the Select Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS which\ndetermines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI\nconstituents belonging\nto the Alternative\nCarriers,\nCommunications\nEquipment, Integrated\nTelecommunication\nServices, and Wireless\nTelecommunication\nServices sub-industries\nthat satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i)\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $500 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio\n(defined by dollar\nvalue traded over the\nprevious 12 months\ndivided by the float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date) greater\nthan or equal to 90% or\nhave a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization\ngreater than or equal\nto $400 million with a\nfloat-adjusted\nliquidity ratio (as\ndefined above) greater\nthan or equal to 150%;\nand (ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold are\neach reviewed from time\nto time based on market\nconditions. The Index\nrebalances and\nreconstitutes quarterly\non the third Friday of\nthe quarter ending\nmonth. The reference\ndate for additions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The S&P\nTMI tracks all eligible\nU.S. common equities\nlisted on the NYSE,\nNYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nSelect Market, NASDAQ\nCapital Market, Cboe\nBZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe\nEDGA, or Cboe EDGX\nexchanges. The Index is\nmodified equal\nweighted. As of July\n31, 2021, the Index\ncomprised 46 stocks.\nThe Index is sponsored\nby S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d), which is\nnot affiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the Index\nand publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will change\nin value, and you could\nlose money by investing\nin the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund\nis not insured or\nguaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other government\nagency. Market Risk:\nThe Fund's investments\nare subject to changes\nin general economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in\ninvestment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect global\neconomies and markets.\nLocal, regional or\nglobal events such as\nwar, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of\ninfectious illness or\nother public health\nissues, or other events\ncould have a\nsignificant impact on\nthe Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity\nInvesting Risk: The\nmarket prices of equity\nsecurities owned by the\nFund may go up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may\ndecline for a number of\nreasons that may\ndirectly relate to the\nissuer and also may\ndecline due to general\nindustry or market\nconditions that are not\nspecifically related to\na particular company.\nIn addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause\nstock prices to fall\nover short or extended\nperiods of time.\nTelecommunications\nSector Risk: The\ntelecommunications\nindustry is subject to\nextensive government\nregulation. The costs\nof complying with\ngovernmental\nregulations, delays or\nfailure to receive\nrequired regulatory\napprovals or the\nenactment of new\nadverse regulatory\nrequirements may\nadversely affect the\nbusiness of the\ntelecommunications\ncompanies. The\ntelecommunications\nindustry can also be\nsignificantly affected\nby intense competition,\nincluding competition\nwith alternative\ntechnologies such as\nwireless\ncommunications, product\ncompatibility, consumer\npreferences, rapid\nproduct obsolescence\nand research and\ndevelopment of new\nproducts. Technological\ninnovations may make\nthe products and\nservices of\ntelecommunications\ncompanies obsolete.\nOther 260 Table of\nContents risks include\nuncertainties resulting\nfrom such companies'\ndiversification into\nnew domestic and\ninternational\nbusinesses, as well as\nagreements by any such\ncompanies linking\nfuture rate increases\nto inflation or other\nfactors not directly\nrelated to the actual\noperating profits of\nthe enterprise.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary\nmarket may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net\nasset value per share\nand there may be times\nwhen the market price\nof the shares is more\nthan the net asset\nvalue per share\n(premium) or less than\nthe net asset value per\nshare (discount). This\nrisk is heightened in\ntimes of market\nvolatility or periods\nof steep market\ndeclines. Concentration\nRisk: When the Fund\nfocuses its investments\nin a particular\nindustry or sector,\nfinancial, economic,\nbusiness, and other\ndevelopments affecting\nissuers in that\nindustry, market, or\neconomic sector will\nhave a greater effect\non the Fund than if it\nhad not done so.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject to\ncredit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other transactions.\nIf a counterparty fails\nto meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty, resulting\nin a loss to the Fund.\nIf the Fund holds\ncollateral posted by\nits counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the event\nof a bankruptcy or\ninsolvency proceeding\nrelating to the\ncounterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative transactions\ncan create investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant volatility.\nIt is possible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The counterparty\nto a derivatives\ncontract may be unable\nor unwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives transaction\nmay not behave in the\nmanner anticipated by\nthe Adviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by the\nAdviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking\nRisk: The Fund is\nmanaged with an\nindexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to\ntrack the performance\nof an unmanaged index\nof securities,\nregardless of the\ncurrent or projected\nperformance of the\nIndex or of the actual\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-\nmanaged fund, which\ntypically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark\nindex. As a result, the\nFund's performance may\nbe less favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an active\ninvestment strategy.\nThe structure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk of\nthe Fund. When there\nare changes made to the\ncomponent securities of\nthe Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio\nchanges will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund\nand its shareholders.\nThe Fund may recognize\ngains as a result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required to\ndistribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences. While\nthe Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance\nof the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree\nof correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not applicable\nto the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying\nand selling securities.\nIn addition, the Fund\nmay not be fully\ninvested at times,\ngenerally as a result\nof cash flows into or\nout of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to\ntrack the Index return\nby investing in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not included\nin the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Liquidity Risk:\nLack of a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a discount\nfrom comparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the liquidity\nof the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset value\nof Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the\nFund Shares being less\nliquid. Illiquidity of\nthe Fund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a timely\nbasis. In addition, the\nFund, due to\nlimitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests\nin a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for periods\nof time solely as a\nresult of tracking the\nIndex (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities). 261\n\nTable of Contents Fund\nPerformance The\nfollowing bar chart and\ntable provide an\nindication of the risks\nof investing in the\nFund by showing changes\nin the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Michael Feehily,\nKarl Schneider and Michael Finocchi. Michael\nFeehily, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of\nthe Adviser and the Head of Global Equity Beta\nSolutions in the Americas. He worked at the\nAdviser from 1997 to 2006 and rejoined in\n2010. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Managing\nDirector of the Adviser and Deputy Head of\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions in the Americas.\nHe joined the Adviser in 1997. Michael\nFinocchi is a Principal of the Adviser and a\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2005. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary\n\n262\n\nTable of Contents market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment.

You may pay other fees,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and other fees\nto financial intermediaries, which are not\nreflected in the table and Example below.\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that\nyou pay each year as a percentage of the value\nof your investment):\n                                              \n  Management fees                      0.35%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1)     None   \n  fees                                        \n  Other expenses                       0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating          0.35%  \n  expenses                                    \n                                              \nExample: This Example is intended to help you\ncompare the cost of investing in the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other funds. The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $36       $113    $197     $443  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 26%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the S&P\nTransportation Select\nIndustry Index (the\n\u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund\nemploys a sampling\nstrategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase\nall of the securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex. Instead, the\nFund may purchase a\nsubset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is\nclassified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under\nthe Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as\namended; however, the\nFund may become \u201cnon-\ndiversified\u201d solely as\na result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings\nof one or more\ncomponent securities).\nWhen the Fund is non-\ndiversified, it may\ninvest a relatively\nhigh percentage of its\nassets in a limited\nnumber of issuers.\nUnder normal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\n\n264\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows. The Index\nrepresents the\ntransportation segment\nof the S&P Total\nMarket Index (\u201cS&P\nTMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is\ndesigned to track the\nbroad U.S. equity\nmarket. The\ntransportation segment\nof the S&P TMI\ncomprises the\nfollowing sub-\nindustries: Air\nFreight & Logistics,\nAirlines, Airport\nServices, Highways &\nRail Tracks, Marine,\nMarine Ports &\nServices, Railroads,\nand Trucking. The\nIndex is one of\ntwenty-one (21) of the\nS&P Select Industry\nIndices (the \u201cSelect\nIndustry Indices\u201d),\neach designed to\nmeasure the\nperformance of a\nnarrow sub-industry or\ngroup of sub-\nindustries determined\nbased on the Global\nIndustry\nClassification\nStandard (\u201cGICS\u201d).\nMembership in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices is based on\nthe GICS\nclassification, as\nwell as liquidity and\nmarket cap\nrequirements.\nCompanies in the\nSelect Industry\nIndices are classified\naccording to GICS\nwhich determines\nclassifications\nprimarily based on\nrevenues; however,\nearnings and market\nperception are also\nconsidered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P\nTMI constituents\nbelonging to the Air\nFreight & Logistics,\nAirlines, Airport\nServices, Highways &\nRail Tracks, Marine,\nMarine Ports &\nServices, Railroads,\nand Trucking sub-\nindustries that\nsatisfy the following\ncriteria: (i) have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $500\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by\ndollar value traded\nover the previous 12\nmonths divided by the\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization as of\nthe index rebalancing\nreference date)\ngreater than or equal\nto 90% or have a\nfloat-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater\nthan or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-\nadjusted liquidity\nratio (as defined\nabove) greater than or\nequal to 150%; and\n(ii) are U.S. based\ncompanies. To evaluate\nliquidity, the dollar\nvalue traded for\ninitial public\nofferings or spin-offs\nthat do not have 12\nmonths of trading\nhistory is annualized.\nThe market\ncapitalization\nthreshold may be\nrelaxed to ensure that\nthere are at least 22\nstocks in the Index as\nof the rebalancing\neffective date.\nExisting Index\nconstituents are\nremoved at the\nquarterly rebalancing\neffective date if\neither their float-\nadjusted market\ncapitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or\ntheir float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls\nbelow 50%. The market\ncapitalization\nthreshold and the\nliquidity threshold\nare each reviewed from\ntime to time based on\nmarket conditions. The\nIndex rebalances and\nreconstitutes\nquarterly on the third\nFriday of the quarter\nending month. The\nreference date for\nadditions and\ndeletions is after the\nclose of the last\ntrading date of the\nprevious month. The\nS&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common\nequities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE\nAmerican, NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market,\nNASDAQ Select Market,\nNASDAQ Capital Market,\nCboe BZX, Cboe BYX,\nCboe EDGA, or Cboe\nEDGX exchanges. The\nIndex is modified\nequal weighted. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 44\nstocks. The Index is\nsponsored by S&P Dow\nJones Indices LLC (the\n\u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not\naffiliated with the\nFund or the Adviser.\nThe Index Provider\ndetermines the\ncomposition of the\nIndex, relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex and publishes\ninformation regarding\nthe market value of\nthe Index. Principal\nRisks of Investing in\nthe Fund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. Transportation\nCompanies Risk:\nTransportation\ncompanies can be\nsignificantly affected\nby changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices,\nlabor relations,\ntechnology\ndevelopments, exchange\nrates, insurance\ncosts, industry\ncompetition and\ngovernment regulation.\nFluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times 265 Table\nof Contents when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nConcentration Risk:\nWhen the Fund focuses\nits investments in a\nparticular industry or\nsector, financial,\neconomic, business,\nand other developments\naffecting issuers in\nthat industry, market,\nor economic sector\nwill have a greater\neffect on the Fund\nthan if it had not\ndone so. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be\nsubject to credit risk\nwith respect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Industrial\nSector Risk:\nIndustrial companies\nare affected by supply\nand demand both for\ntheir specific product\nor service and for\nindustrial sector\nproducts in general.\nGovernment regulation,\nworld events, exchange\nrates and economic\nconditions,\ntechnological\ndevelopments and\nliabilities for\nenvironmental damage\nand general civil\nliabilities will\nlikewise affect the\nperformance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace\nand defense companies,\na component of the\nindustrial sector, can\nbe significantly\naffected by government\nspending policies\nbecause companies\ninvolved in this\nindustry rely, to a\nsignificant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign\ngovernment demand for\ntheir products and\nservices. Thus, the\nfinancial condition\nof, and investor\ninterest in, aerospace\nand defense companies\nare heavily influenced\nby governmental\ndefense spending\npolicies which are\ntypically under\npressure from efforts\nto control the U.S.\n(and other) government\nbudgets.\nTransportation\nsecurities, a\ncomponent of the\nindustrial sector, are\ncyclical and have\noccasional sharp price\nmovements which may\nresult from changes in\nthe economy, fuel\nprices, labor\nagreements and\ninsurance costs.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. 266\n\nTable of Contents Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nTo the extent the Fund\nbecomes \u201cnon-\ndiversified,\u201d the Fund\nmay hold a smaller\nnumber of portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become non-\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n268 Table of Contents Additional Strategies\nInformation Principal Strategies General .\nPlease see each Fund's \u201cThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund\nSummaries\u201d above for a complete discussion of\neach Fund's principal investment strategies. A\nFund may invest in various types of securities\nand engage in various investment techniques\nwhich are not the principal focus of the Fund\nand therefore are not described in this\nProspectus. These securities, techniques and\npractices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain\nfree of charge by contacting shareholder\nservices (see the back cover of this\nProspectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of\neach Fund's Index as closely as possible\n(i.e., obtain a high degree of correlation\nwith the Index). A number of factors may\naffect a Fund's ability to achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with its Index, and\nthere can be no guarantee that a Fund will\nachieve a high degree of correlation. For\nexample, a Fund may not be able to achieve a\nhigh degree of correlation with its Index when\nthere are practical difficulties or\nsubstantial costs involved in compiling a\nportfolio of securities to follow the Index,\nwhen a security in the Index becomes\ntemporarily illiquid, unavailable or less\nliquid, or legal restrictions exist that\nprohibit the Fund from investing in a security\nin the Index. The Adviser will utilize a\nsampling strategy in managing the Funds.\nSampling means that the Adviser uses\nquantitative analysis to select securities,\nincluding securities in the Index, outside of\nthe Index and derivatives that have a similar\ninvestment profile as the relevant Index in\nterms of key risk factors, performance\nattributes and other economic characteristics.\nThese include industry weightings, market\ncapitalization, and other financial\ncharacteristics of securities. The quantity of\nholdings in a Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nIn addition, from time to time, securities are\nadded to or removed from each Index. The\nAdviser may sell securities that are\nrepresented in an Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in an\nIndex, in anticipation of their removal from\nor addition to an Index. Further, the Adviser\nmay choose to overweight securities in an\nIndex, purchase or sell securities not in an\nIndex, or utilize various combinations of\nother available techniques, in seeking to\ntrack an Index. Certain of the Funds, as\ndescribed in the SAI, have adopted a non-\nfundamental investment policy to invest at\nleast 80% of their respective net assets, plus\nthe amount of borrowings for investment\npurposes, in investments suggested by their\nrespective names, measured at the time of\ninvestment. A Fund will provide shareholders\nwith at least 60 days' notice prior to any\nchange in this non-fundamental 80% investment\npolicy. The Board of Trustees of the Trust\n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change a Fund's investment\nstrategy, Index and other policies without\nshareholder approval, except as otherwise\nindicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI.\nThe Board may also change a Fund's investment\nobjective without shareholder approval. Non-\nPrincipal Strategies Certain Other Investments\n. Each Fund may invest in structured notes\n(notes on which the amount of principal\nrepayment and interest payments are based on\nthe movement of one or more specified factors\nsuch as the movement of a particular security\nor index), swaps, options and futures\ncontracts. Swaps, options and futures\ncontracts and structured notes may be used by\na Fund in seeking performance that corresponds\nto its Index and in managing cash flows.\nTemporary Defensive Positions . In certain\nsituations or market conditions, a Fund may\ntemporarily depart from its normal investment\npolicies and strategies, provided that the\nalternative is consistent with the Fund's\ninvestment objective and is in the best\ninterest of the Fund. For example, a Fund may\nmake larger than normal investments in\nderivatives to maintain exposure to its Index\nif it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . Each\nFund may borrow money from a bank as permitted\nby the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing\nstatute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund, but only for\ntemporary or emergency purposes. Each Fund may\nalso invest in reverse repurchase agreements,\nwhich are considered borrowings under the 1940\nAct. Although the 1940 Act presently allows a\nFund to borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or 269\n\nTable of Contents hypothecating assets) in an\namount up to 33 1/ 3% of its total assets (not\nincluding temporary borrowings not in excess\nof 5% of its total assets), and there is no\npercentage limit on Fund assets that can be\nused in connection with reverse repurchase\nagreements, under normal circumstances any\nborrowings by a Fund will not exceed 10% of\nthe Fund's total assets. Lending of Securities\n. Each Fund may lend its portfolio securities\nin an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of\nits net assets via a securities lending\nprogram through its securities lending agent,\nState Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState\nStreet\u201d or the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers,\ndealers and other financial institutions\ndesiring to borrow securities to complete\ntransactions and for other purposes. A\nsecurities lending program allows a Fund to\nreceive a portion of the income generated by\nlending its securities and investing the\nrespective collateral. A Fund will receive\ncollateral for each loaned security which is\nat least equal to the market value of that\nsecurity, marked to market each trading day.\nIn the securities lending program, the\nborrower generally has the right to vote the\nloaned securities; however, a Fund may call\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the Fund's economic interest in the\ninvestment is to be voted upon. Security loans\nmay be terminated at any time by a Fund.\nAdditional Risk Information The following\nsection provides information regarding the\nprincipal risks identified under \u201cPrincipal\nRisks of Investing in the Fund\u201d in each Fund\nSummary along with additional risk\ninformation. Risk information is applicable to\nall Funds unless otherwise noted.\n\nPrincipal Risks The tables below identify the\nprincipal risks of investing in each Fund.\n

Aerospace and defense\ncompanies can be significantly affected by\ngovernment aerospace and defense regulation\nand spending policies because companies\ninvolved in this industry rely to a\nsignificant extent on U.S. (and other)\ngovernment demand for their products and\nservices. Thus, the financial condition of,\nand investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which\nare typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol the U.S. (and other) government\nbudgets. Banking Companies Risk . The\nperformance of bank stocks may be affected by\nextensive governmental regulation which may\nlimit both the amounts and types of loans and\nother financial commitments they can make, and\nthe interest rates and fees they can charge\nand the amount of capital they must maintain.\nProfitability is largely dependent on the\navailability and cost of capital funds, and\ncan fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change. Credit losses resulting from\nfinancial difficulties of borrowers can\nnegatively impact the banking companies. Banks\nmay also be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Competition among banking\ncompanies is high and failure to maintain or\nincrease market share may result in lost\nmarket value. Biotechnology Companies Risk .\nBiotech companies invest heavily in research\nand development which may not necessarily lead\nto commercially successful products. These\ncompanies are also subject to increased\ngovernmental regulation which may delay or\ninhibit the release of new products. Many\nbiotech companies are dependent upon their\nability to use and enforce intellectual\nproperty rights and patents. Any impairment of\nsuch rights may have adverse financial\nconsequences. Biotech stocks, especially those\nof smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to\nbe more volatile than the overall market.\nBiotech companies can be significantly\naffected by technological change and\nobsolescence, product liability lawsuits and\nconsequential high insurance costs.\nCall/Prepayment Risk . Call/prepayment risk is\nthe risk that an issuer will exercise its\nright to pay principal on an obligation held\nby a Fund earlier than expected or required.\nThis may occur, for example, when there is a\ndecline in interest rates, and an issuer of\nbonds or preferred stock redeems the bonds or\nstock in order to replace them with\nobligations on which it is required to pay a\nlower interest or dividend rate. It may also\noccur when there is an unanticipated increase\nin the rate at which mortgages or other\nreceivables underlying mortgage- or asset-\nbacked securities held by a Fund are prepaid.\nIn any such case, a Fund may be forced to\ninvest the prepaid amounts in lower-yielding\ninvestments, resulting in a decline in the\nFund's income. Capital Markets Companies Risk\n. Companies within an Index can be\nsignificantly affected by stock and bank\ntrading activity, changes in governmental\nregulation, continuing increases in price\ncompetition, decreases in fees or fee-related\nbusiness, including investment banking,\nbrokerage, asset management and other\nservicing fees, fluctuation in interest rates\nand other factors which could adversely affect\nfinancial markets. Clean Power Companies Risk.\nClean power companies may be highly dependent\nupon government subsidies, contracts with\ngovernment entities, and the successful\ndevelopment of new and proprietary\ntechnologies. Clean power companies may be\naffected by competition from new and existing\nmarket entrants, obsolescence of technology,\nshort product cycles, changes in exchange\nrates, imposition of import controls, and\ndepletion of resources. In addition, seasonal\nweather conditions, fluctuations in supply of\nand demand for clean energy products or\nservices, and international political events\nmay cause fluctuations in the performance of\nclean power companies and the prices of their\nsecurities. Risks associated with fluctuations\nin energy prices and supply and demand of\nalternative energy fuels, energy conservation,\nthe success of exploration projects and tax\nand other government regulations can\nsignificantly affect clean power companies.\nThe supply and demand for oil and gas, the\nprice of oil and gas, production spending,\ngovernment regulation, world events and\neconomic conditions may also affect clean\npower companies. Communication Services Sector\nRisk. Communication services companies are\nparticularly vulnerable to the potential\nobsolescence of products and services due to\ntechnological advancement and the innovation\nof competitors. Companies in the communication\nservices sector may also be affected by other\ncompetitive pressures, such as pricing\ncompetition, as well as research and\ndevelopment costs, substantial capital\nrequirements and government regulation.\nAdditionally, fluctuating domestic and\ninternational demand, shifting demographics\nand often unpredictable changes in consumer\ntastes can drastically affect a communication\nservices company's profitability. While all\ncompanies may be susceptible to network\nsecurity breaches, certain companies in the\ncommunication services sector may be\nparticular targets of hacking and potential\ntheft of proprietary or consumer information\nor disruptions in service, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their businesses.\n292 Table of Contents Computer\nSoftware/Services Companies Risk . Computer\nsoftware/services companies can be\nsignificantly affected by competitive\npressures, aggressive pricing, technological\ndevelopments, changing domestic demand, the\nability to attract and retain skilled\nemployees and availability and price of\ncomponents. The market for products produced\nby computer software/services companies is\ncharacterized by rapidly changing technology,\nrapid product obsolescence, cyclical market\npatterns, evolving industry standards and\nfrequent new product introductions. The\nsuccess of computer software/services\ncompanies depends in substantial part on the\ntimely and successful introduction of new\nproducts and the ability to service such\nproducts. An unexpected change in one or more\nof the technologies affecting an issuer's\nproducts or in the market for products based\non a particular technology could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on a participant's\noperating results. Many computer\nsoftware/services companies rely on a\ncombination of patents, copyrights, trademarks\nand trade secret laws to establish and protect\ntheir proprietary rights in their products and\ntechnologies. There can be no assurance that\nthe steps taken by computer software/services\ncompanies to protect their proprietary rights\nwill be adequate to prevent misappropriation\nof their technology or that competitors will\nnot independently develop technologies that\nare substantially equivalent or superior to\nsuch companies' technology. Concentration Risk\n. A Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to\nthe extent that the Fund's underlying Index\nconcentrates in a particular industry or group\nof industries. When a Fund focuses its\ninvestments in a particular industry or\nsector, financial, economic, business, and\nother developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have\na greater effect on the Fund than if it had\nnot focused its assets in that industry,\nmarket, or economic sector, which may increase\nthe volatility of the Fund. Consumer\nDiscretionary Sector Risk . The success of\nconsumer product manufacturers and retailers\nis tied closely to the performance of the\noverall global economy, interest rates,\ncompetition and consumer confidence. Success\ndepends heavily on disposable household income\nand consumer spending. Also, companies in the\nconsumer discretionary sector may be subject\nto severe competition, which may have an\nadverse impact on their respective\nprofitability. Changes in demographics and\nconsumer tastes can also affect the demand\nfor, and success of, consumer products and\nservices in the marketplace. Consumer Staples\nSector Risk . Consumer staples companies are\nsubject to government regulation affecting\ntheir products which may negatively impact\nsuch companies' performance. For instance,\ngovernment regulations may affect the\npermissibility of using various food additives\nand production methods of companies that make\nfood products, which could affect company\nprofitability. Tobacco companies may be\nadversely affected by the adoption of proposed\nlegislation and/or by litigation. Also, the\nsuccess of food, beverage, household and\npersonal products companies may be strongly\naffected by consumer interest, marketing\ncampaigns and other factors affecting supply\nand demand, including performance of the\noverall domestic and international economy,\ninterest rates, competition and consumer\nconfidence and spending. Counterparty Risk . A\nFund will be subject to credit risk with\nrespect to the counterparties with which the\nFund enters into derivatives contracts and\nother transactions such as repurchase\nagreements or reverse repurchase agreements. A\nFund's ability to profit from these types of\ninvestments and transactions will depend on\nthe willingness and ability of its\ncounterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, a Fund may be unable to terminate\nor realize any gain on the investment or\ntransaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund.\nA Fund may experience significant delays in\nobtaining any recovery in an insolvency,\nbankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding\ninvolving its counterparty (including recovery\nof any collateral posted by it) and may obtain\nonly a limited recovery or may obtain no\nrecovery in such circumstances. If a Fund\nholds collateral posted by its counterparty,\nit may be delayed or prevented from realizing\non the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if a Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another institution being\nsubstituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, a\nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the\nfinancial institution's authority, the\nfinancial institution's liabilities could 293\nTable of Contents be written down, eliminated\nor converted into equity or an alternative\ninstrument of ownership. A bail-in of a\nfinancial institution may result in a\nreduction in value of some or all of its\nsecurities and, if a Fund holds such\nsecurities or has entered into a transaction\nwith such a financial security when a bail-in\noccurs, such Fund may also be similarly\nimpacted. Currency Risk. Investments in\nissuers in different countries are often\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar. Changes in the values of those\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar may\nhave a positive or negative effect on the\nvalues of a Fund's investments denominated in\nthose currencies. The values of other\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar may\nfluctuate in response to, among other factors,\ninterest rate changes, intervention (or\nfailure to intervene) by national governments,\ncentral banks, or supranational entities such\nas the International Monetary Fund, the\nimposition of currency controls, and other\npolitical or regulatory developments. Currency\nvalues can decrease significantly both in the\nshort term and over the long term in response\nto these and other developments. Continuing\nuncertainty as to the status of the Euro and\nthe Economic and Monetary Union of the\nEuropean Union (the \u201cEMU\u201d) has created\nsignificant volatility in currency and\nfinancial markets generally. Any partial or\ncomplete dissolution of the EMU, or any\ncontinued uncertainty as to its status, could\nhave significant adverse effects on currency\nand financial markets, and on the values of a\nFund's portfolio investments. Cybersecurity\nCompanies Risk . Companies in the\ncybersecurity field face intense competition,\nboth domestically and internationally, which\nmay have an adverse effect on profit margins.\nCybersecurity companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. The products of cybersecurity\ncompanies may face obsolescence due to rapid\ntechnological developments and frequent new\nproduct introduction, and such companies may\nface unpredictable changes in growth rates,\ncompetition for the services of qualified\npersonnel and competition from foreign\ncompetitors with lower production costs.\nCompanies in the cybersecurity field are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual\nproperty rights. The loss or impairment of\nthese rights may adversely affect the\nprofitability of these companies.\nCybersecurity-Related Risk . The companies\nincluded in the Index rely on technologies\nsuch as the Internet and depend on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, and therefore may be prone to\noperational and information security risks\nresulting from cyber-attacks and/or\ntechnological malfunctions. Cyber-attacks\ninclude, among others, stealing or corrupting\ndata maintained online or digitally,\npreventing legitimate users from accessing\ninformation or services on a website,\nreleasing confidential information without\nauthorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. In general, cyber-attacks are\ndeliberate, but unintentional events may have\nsimilar effects. Successful cyber-attacks\nagainst, or security breakdowns of, a company\nincluded in the Index may result in material\nadverse consequences for such company, as well\nas other companies included in the Index, and\nmay cause a Fund's investments to lose value.\nDebt Securities Risk . The values of debt\nsecurities may increase or decrease as a\nresult of the following: market fluctuations,\nchanges in interest rates, actual or perceived\ninability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make\nscheduled principal or interest payments or\nilliquidity in debt securities markets; the\nrisk of low rates of return due to\nreinvestment of securities during periods of\nfalling interest rates or repayment by issuers\nwith higher coupon or interest rates; and/or\nthe risk of low income due to falling interest\nrates. To the extent that interest rates rise,\ncertain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally\nanticipated and the value of those securities\nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of a Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, a decline\nin the Fund's income and yield, an adverse\nimpact on the liquidity of a Fund's fixed\nincome securities, and increased volatility of\nthe fixed income markets. The current\nhistorically low interest rate environment\nheightens the risks associated with rising\ninterest rates. During periods when interest\nrates are at low levels, a Fund's yield can be\nlow, and a Fund may have a negative yield\n(i.e., it may lose money on an operating\nbasis). If the principal on a debt obligation\nis prepaid before expected, the prepayments of\nprincipal may have to be reinvested in\nobligations paying interest at lower rates.\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, the\nincome received by a Fund may decline. Changes\nin interest rates will likely have a greater\neffect on the values of debt securities of\nlonger durations. Returns on investments in\ndebt securities could trail the returns on\nother investment options, including\ninvestments in equity securities. Depositary\nReceipts Risk . American Depositary Receipts\n(\u201cADRs\u201d) are typically trust receipts issued\nby a U.S. bank or trust company that evidence\nan indirect interest in underlying securities\nissued by a foreign entity. Global Depositary\nReceipts (\u201cGDRs\u201d), European Depositary\nReceipts (\u201cEDRs\u201d), and other types of\ndepositary receipts are typically 294 Table of\nContents issued by non-U.S. banks or financial\ninstitutions to evidence an interest in\nunderlying securities issued by either a U.S.\nor a non-U.S. entity. Investments in non-U.S.\nissuers through ADRs, GDRs, EDRs, and other\ntypes of depositary receipts generally involve\nrisks applicable to other types of investments\nin non-U.S. issuers. Investments in depositary\nreceipts may be less liquid and more volatile\nthan the underlying securities in their\nprimary trading market. If a depositary\nreceipt is denominated in a different currency\nthan its underlying securities, a Fund will be\nsubject to the currency risk of both the\ninvestment in the depositary receipt and the\nunderlying security. There may be less\npublicly available information regarding the\nissuer of the securities underlying a\ndepositary receipt than if those securities\nwere traded directly in U.S. securities\nmarkets. Depositary receipts may or may not be\nsponsored by the issuers of the underlying\nsecurities, and information regarding issuers\nof securities underlying unsponsored\ndepositary receipts may be more limited than\nfor sponsored depositary receipts. The values\nof depositary receipts may decline for a\nnumber of reasons relating to the issuers or\nsponsors of the depositary receipts,\nincluding, but not limited to, insolvency of\nthe issuer or sponsor. Holders of depositary\nreceipts may have limited or no rights to take\naction with respect to the underlying\nsecurities or to compel the issuer of the\nreceipts to take action. The prices of\ndepositary receipts may differ from the prices\nof securities upon which they are based. To\nthe extent a Fund invests in depositary\nreceipts based on securities included in its\nIndex, such differences in prices may increase\nindex tracking risk. Derivatives Risk. A\nderivative is a financial contract the value\nof which depends on, or is derived from, the\nvalue of an underlying asset, interest rate,\nor index. Derivative transactions typically\ninvolve leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a derivative\ntransaction will result in a loss greater than\nthe principal amount invested, and a Fund may\nnot be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price.\nRisks associated with derivative instruments\ninclude potential changes in value in response\nto interest rate changes or other market\ndevelopments or as a result of the\ncounterparty's credit quality; the potential\nfor the derivative transaction not to have the\neffect the Adviser anticipated or a different\nor less favorable effect than the Adviser\nanticipated; the failure of the counterparty\nto the derivative transaction to perform its\nobligations under the transaction or to settle\na trade; possible mispricing or improper\nvaluation of the derivative instrument;\nimperfect correlation in the value of a\nderivative with the asset, rate, or index\nunderlying the derivative; the risk that a\nFund may be required to post collateral or\nmargin with its counterparty, and will not be\nable to recover the collateral or margin in\nthe event of the counterparty's insolvency or\nbankruptcy; the risk that a Fund will\nexperience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including without\nlimitation absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to a\nFund due to losses on the transaction and an\nincrease in volatility; the potential for the\nderivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction.\nFutures Contract Risk; Other Exchange-Traded\nDerivatives Risk . The risk of loss relating\nto the use of futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives is potentially\nunlimited. The ability to establish and close\nout positions in futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives will be subject to\nthe development and maintenance of a liquid\nsecondary market. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract or\nother exchange-traded derivative or at any\nparticular time. In the event no such market\nexists for a particular derivative, it might\nnot be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate the derivative. In using futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives, the Fund will be reliant on the\nability of the Adviser to predict market and\nprice movements correctly; the skills needed\nto use such derivatives successfully are\ndifferent from those needed for traditional\nportfolio management. If the Fund uses futures\ncontracts or other exchange-traded derivatives\nfor hedging purposes, there is a risk of\nimperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the derivatives and movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying the derivatives\nor movements in the prices of the Fund's\ninvestments that are the subject of such\nhedge. The prices of futures and other\nexchange-traded derivatives, for a number of\nreasons, may not correlate perfectly with\nmovements in the securities or index\nunderlying them. For example, participants in\nthe futures markets and in markets for other\nexchange-traded derivatives are subject to\nmargin deposit requirements. Such requirements\nmay cause investors to take actions with\nrespect to their derivatives positions that\nthey would not otherwise take. The margin\nrequirements in the derivatives markets may be\nless onerous than margin requirements in the\nsecurities markets in general, and as a result\nthose markets may attract more speculators\nthan the securities markets do. Increased\nparticipation by speculators in those markets\nmay cause temporary price distortions. Due to\nthe possibility of price distortion, even a\ncorrect forecast of general market trends by\nthe Adviser still may not result in a\nsuccessful derivatives activity over a very\nshort time period. The risk of a position in\n295 Table of Contents a futures contract or\nother exchange-traded derivative may be very\nlarge compared to the relatively low level of\nmargin the Fund is required to deposit. In\nmany cases, a relatively small price movement\nin a futures contract may result in immediate\nand substantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its exchange-traded\nderivatives transactions. The Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with\nits transactions in futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives. In the\nevent of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, the\nFund may not be able to recover all (or any)\nof the margin it has posted with the futures\ncommission merchant, or to realize the value\nof any increase in the price of its positions,\nor it may experience a significant delay in\ndoing so. The Fund also may be delayed or\nprevented from recovering margin or other\namounts deposited with a futures commission\nmerchant or futures clearinghouse. The\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the\n\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have\nestablished limits referred to as \u201cspeculative\nposition limits\u201d on the maximum net long or\nnet short positions that any person and\ncertain affiliated entities may hold or\ncontrol in a particular futures contract.\nTrading limits are imposed on the number of\ncontracts that any person may trade on a\nparticular trading day. An exchange may order\nthe liquidation of positions found to be in\nviolation of these limits and it may impose\nsanctions or restrictions. In addition, the\nDodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to establish\nspeculative position limits on certain\ncommodity futures contracts and their\neconomically equivalent futures, options and\nswaps. Regulatory action taken by the CFTC to\nestablish these additional position limits may\nadversely affect the market liquidity of the\nfutures, options and economically equivalent\nderivatives in which the Fund may invest. It\nis possible that, as a result of such limits,\nthe Fund's Adviser will be precluded from\ntaking positions in certain futures contracts\nor over-the-counter derivatives as a result of\npositions held by other clients of the Adviser\nor by the Adviser or its affiliates\nthemselves. Futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives traded on markets\noutside the U.S. are not generally subject to\nthe same level of regulation by the CFTC or\nother U.S. regulatory entities as contracts\ntraded in the U.S., including without\nlimitation as to the execution, delivery, and\nclearing of transactions. U.S. regulators\nneither regulate the activities of a foreign\nexchange, nor have the power to compel\nenforcement of the rules of the foreign\nexchange or the laws of the foreign country in\nquestion. Margin and other payments made by a\nFund may not be afforded the same protections\nas are afforded those payments in the U.S.,\nincluding in connection with the insolvency of\nan executing or clearing broker or a\nclearinghouse or exchange. Certain foreign\nfutures contracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives may be less liquid and more\nvolatile than U.S. contracts. Dividend-Paying\nSecurities Risk . Securities that pay\ndividends, as a group, can fall out of favor\nwith the market, causing such companies to\nunderperform companies that do not pay\ndividends. In addition, changes in the\ndividend policies of the companies held by a\nFund or the capital resources available for\nsuch company's dividend payments may adversely\naffect the Fund. Drone Companies Risk . Drone\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets, financial resources or personnel and\nare subject to the risks of changes in\nbusiness cycles, world economic growth,\ntechnological progress, and government\nregulation. Securities of drone companies,\nespecially smaller, start-up companies, tend\nto be more volatile than securities of\ncompanies that do not rely heavily on\ntechnology. These companies may face intense\ncompetition and potentially rapid product\nobsolescence. In addition, drone companies may\nbe dependent on the U.S. government and its\nagencies for a significant portion of their\nsales, and their success and growth may be\ndependent on their ability to win future\ngovernment contracts. As a result, such\ncompanies may be negatively affected by\nbudgetary constraints, spending reductions,\ncongressional appropriations, and\nadministrative allocations of funds that\naffect the U.S. government and its agencies.\nDrone companies may rely on a combination of\npatents, copyrights, trademarks and trade\nsecret laws to establish and protect their\nproprietary rights in their products and\ntechnologies, and may be adversely affected by\nloss or impairment of those rights. Legal and\nregulatory changes may have an impact on a\ndrone company's products or services. In\naddition, drone companies may also be subject\nto increasing regulatory constraints that may\nlimit the sale or use of a company's products,\nincluding the need to obtain regulatory\napprovals from certain government agencies.\nDrone companies typically engage in\nsignificant amounts of spending on research\nand development, and there is no guarantee\nthat the products or services produced by\nthese companies will be successful.\nElectronics Companies Risk. Electronics\ncompanies can be significantly affected by\ncompetitive pressures, aggressive pricing,\ntechnological developments, changing domestic\ndemand, the ability to attract and retain\nskilled employees and availability and price\nof components. The market for products is\ncharacterized by rapidly changing technology,\nrapid product obsolescence, cyclical market\npatterns, evolving industry standards and\nfrequent new product introductions. 296 Table\nof Contents The success of electronics\ncompanies depends in substantial part on the\ntimely and successful introduction of new\nproducts. An unexpected change in one or more\nof the technologies affecting an issuer's\nproducts or in the market for products based\non a particular technology could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on a participant's\noperating results. Electronic companies may\nrely on a combination of patents, copyrights,\ntrademarks and trade secret laws to establish\nand protect their proprietary rights in their\nproducts and technologies. There can be no\nassurance that the steps taken by such\ncompanies to protect their proprietary rights\nwill be adequate to prevent misappropriation\nof their technology or that competitors will\nnot independently develop technologies that\nare substantially equivalent or superior to\nsuch companies' technology. Emerging Markets\nRisk . Investments in emerging markets are\ngenerally subject to a greater risk of loss\nthan investments in developed markets. This\nmay be due to, among other things, the\npossibility of greater market volatility,\nlower trading volume and liquidity, greater\nrisk of expropriation, nationalization, and\nsocial, political and economic instability,\ngreater reliance on a few industries,\ninternational trade or revenue from particular\ncommodities, less developed accounting, legal\nand regulatory systems, higher levels of\ninflation, deflation or currency devaluation,\ngreater risk of market shut down, and more\nsignificant governmental limitations on\ninvestment policy as compared to those\ntypically found in a developed market. There\nmay be limited legal rights and remedies for\ninvestors in companies domiciled in emerging\nmarkets. In addition, issuers (including\ngovernments) in emerging market countries may\nhave less financial stability than in other\ncountries. The securities of emerging market\ncompanies may trade less frequently and in\nsmaller volumes than more widely held\nsecurities. Market disruptions or substantial\nmarket corrections may limit very\nsignificantly the liquidity of securities of\ncertain companies in a particular country or\ngeographic region, or of all companies in the\ncountry or region. A Fund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions in such securities at\nany time, or at a favorable price, in order to\nmeet the Fund's obligations. There is also the\npotential for unfavorable action such as\nembargo and acts of war. As a result, there\nwill tend to be an increased risk of price\nvolatility in investments in emerging market\ncountries, which may be magnified by currency\nfluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar.\nSettlement and asset custody practices for\ntransactions in emerging markets may differ\nfrom those in developed markets. Such\ndifferences may include possible delays in\nsettlement and certain settlement practices,\nsuch as delivery of securities prior to\nreceipt of payment, which increase the\nlikelihood of a \u201cfailed settlement.\u201d Failed\nsettlements can result in losses. For these\nand other reasons, investments in emerging\nmarkets are often considered speculative.\nEnergy Sector Risk . Issuers in energy-related\nindustries can be significantly affected by\nfluctuations in energy prices and supply and\ndemand of energy fuels caused by geopolitical\nevents, energy conservation or use of\nalternative fuel sources, the success of\nexploration projects, weather or\nmeteorological events, taxes, increased\ngovernmental or environmental regulation,\nresource depletion, rising interest rates,\ndeclines in domestic or foreign production,\naccidents or catastrophic events, or terrorist\nthreats or attacks, among others. Markets for\nvarious energy-related commodities can have\nsignificant volatility, and are subject to\ncontrol or manipulation by large producers or\npurchasers. Companies in the energy sector may\nneed to make substantial expenditures, and to\nincur significant amounts of debt, in order to\nmaintain or expand their reserves through\nexploration of new sources of supply, through\nthe development of existing sources, through\nacquisitions, or through long-term contracts\nto acquire reserves. Factors adversely\naffecting producers, refiners, distributors,\nor others in the energy sector may affect\nadversely companies that service or supply\nthose entities, either because demand for\nthose services or products is curtailed, or\nthose services or products come under price\npressure. Equity Investing Risk . The market\nprices of equity securities owned by a Fund\nmay go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The value of a security may\ndecline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer, such as\nmanagement performance, financial leverage,\nnon-compliance with regulatory requirements,\nand reduced demand for the issuer's goods or\nservices. The values of equity securities also\nmay decline due to general industry or market\nconditions that are not specifically related\nto a particular company, such as real or\nperceived adverse economic conditions, changes\nin the general outlook for corporate earnings,\nchanges in interest or currency rates, or\nadverse investor sentiment generally. In\naddition, equity markets tend to move in\ncycles, which may cause stock prices to fall\nover short or extended periods of time.\nExtension Risk. During periods of rising\ninterest rates, the average life of certain\ntypes of securities may be extended because of\nslower-than-expected principal payments. This\nmay increase the period of time during which\nan investment earns a below-market interest\nrate, increase the security's duration and\nreduce the value of the security. Extension\nrisk may be heightened during periods of\nadverse economic conditions generally, as\npayment rates decline due to higher\nunemployment levels and other factors. 297\nTable of Contents Financial Institutions Risk\n. Some instruments are issued or guaranteed by\nfinancial institutions, such as banks and\nbrokers, or are collateralized by securities\nissued or guaranteed by financial\ninstitutions. Changes in the creditworthiness\nof any of these institutions may adversely\naffect the values of instruments of issuers in\nfinancial industries. Financial institutions\nmay be particularly sensitive to certain\neconomic factors such as interest rate\nchanges, adverse developments in the real\nestate market, fiscal and monetary policy and\ngeneral economic cycles. Adverse developments\nin banking and other financial industries may\ncause a Fund to underperform relative to other\nfunds that invest more broadly across\ndifferent industries or have a smaller\nexposure to financial institutions. Changes in\ngovernmental regulation and oversight of\nfinancial institutions may have an adverse\neffect on the financial condition or the\nearnings or operations of a financial\ninstitution and on the types and amounts of\nbusinesses in which a financial institution\nmay engage. An investor may be delayed or\nprevented from exercising certain remedies\nagainst a financial institution. The amount of\na Fund's assets that may be invested in any\nfinancial institution, or financial\ninstitutions generally, may be limited by\napplicable law. Financial Sector Risk.\nFinancial services companies are subject to\nextensive governmental regulation which may\nlimit both the amounts and types of loans and\nother financial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may\ncause an unusually high degree of volatility\nin the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to\nraise capital (such as the issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or cease operations.\nCredit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses\nassociated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or\npolitical developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage\nfinance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk\n. The net asset value of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate with changes in the market\nvalue of a Fund's securities holdings. The\nmarket prices of Fund Shares will generally\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in a\nFund's net asset value and supply and demand\nof Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be\npredicted whether Fund Shares will trade\nbelow, at or above their net asset value.\nPrice differences may be due, in large part,\nto the fact that supply and demand forces at\nwork in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not\nidentical to, the same forces influencing the\nprices of the securities of an Index trading\nindividually or in the aggregate at any point\nin time. The market prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the net asset value\nof Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares\ncan be created and redeemed in Creation Units\n(unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable discounts\nfrom, and sometimes at premiums to, their net\nasset value), the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to a\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from such Fund's net asset\nvalue. If an investor purchases Fund Shares at\na time when the market price is at a premium\nto the net asset value of Fund Shares or sells\nat a time when the market price is at a\ndiscount to the net asset value of Fund\nShares, then the investor may sustain losses.\nFossil Fuel Reserves Free Ownership Risk. The\nlack of ownership of fossil fuel reserves may\npotentially have an adverse effect on a\ncompany's profitability. The returns on a\nportfolio of securities that seeks to exclude\ncompanies that own fossil fuel reserves may\ntrail the returns on a portfolio of securities\nthat includes companies that own fossil fuel\nreserves. Investing in a portfolio of\nsecurities of companies that do not own fossil\nfuel reserves may affect a Fund's exposure to\ncertain types of investments and may impact\nthe Fund's relative investment performance\ndepending on whether such investments are in\nor out of favor in the market. Growth Stock\nRisk. The prices of growth stocks may be based\nlargely on expectations of future earnings,\nand their prices can decline rapidly and\nsignificantly in reaction to negative news\nabout such factors as earnings, revenues, the\neconomy, political developments, or other\nnews. Growth stocks may underperform value\nstocks and stocks in other 298 Table of\nContents broad style categories (and the stock\nmarket as a whole) over any period of time and\nmay shift in and out of favor with investors\ngenerally, sometimes rapidly, depending on\nchanges in market, economic, and other\nfactors. As a result, at times when it holds\nsubstantial investments in growth stocks, a\nFund may underperform other investment funds\nthat invest more broadly or that favor\ndifferent investment styles. Because growth\ncompanies typically reinvest their earnings,\ngrowth stocks typically do not pay dividends\nat levels associated with other types of\nstocks, if at all. Health Care Equipment\nCompanies Risk : Health care equipment\ncompanies are affected by rising costs of\nmedical products, devices and services and the\nincreased emphasis on the delivery of health\ncare through outpatient services. Competition\nis high among health care equipment companies\nand can be significantly affected by extensive\ngovernment regulation or government\nreimbursement for medical expenses. The\nequipment may be subject to extensive\nlitigation based on malpractice claims,\nproduct liability claims or other litigation.\nMedical equipment manufacturers are heavily\ndependent on patent protection and the\nexpiration of patents may adversely affect\ntheir profitability. Many new health care\nproducts are subject to the approval of the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The\nprocess of obtaining FDA approval is often\nlong and expensive. Health Care Sector Risk .\nCompanies in the health care sector are\nsubject to extensive government regulation and\ntheir profitability can be significantly\naffected by restrictions on government\nreimbursement for medical expenses, rising\ncosts of medical products and services,\npricing pressure (including price\ndiscounting), limited product lines and an\nincreased emphasis on the delivery of\nhealthcare through outpatient services.\nCompanies in the health care sector are\nheavily dependent on obtaining and defending\npatents, which may be time consuming and\ncostly, and the expiration of patents may also\nadversely affect the profitability of these\ncompanies. Health care companies are also\nsubject to extensive litigation based on\nproduct liability and similar claims. In\naddition, their products can become obsolete\ndue to industry innovation, changes in\ntechnologies or other market developments.\nMany new products in the health care sector\nrequire significant research and development\nand may be subject to regulatory approvals,\nall of which may be time consuming and costly\nwith no guarantee that any product will come\nto market. Health Care Services Companies Risk\n. Health care services companies are affected\nby rising costs of medical products, devices\nand services and the increased emphasis on the\ndelivery of health care through outpatient\nservices. Competition is high among health\ncare services companies and can be\nsignificantly affected by extensive government\nregulation or government reimbursement for\nmedical expenses. The equipment may be subject\nto extensive litigation based on malpractice\nclaims, product liability claims or other\nlitigation. Medical equipment manufacturers\nare heavily dependent on patent protection and\nthe expiration of patents may adversely affect\ntheir profitability. Many new health care\nproducts are subject to the approval of the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The\nprocess of obtaining FDA approval is often\nlong and expensive. Homebuilding Companies\nRisk . Homebuilding companies can be\nsignificantly affected by the national,\nregional and local real estate markets.\nHomebuilding companies are also sensitive to\ninterest rate fluctuations which can cause\nchanges in the availability of mortgage\ncapital and directly affect the purchasing\npower of potential homebuyers. Homebuilding\ncompanies can be significantly affected by\nchanges in government spending, consumer\nconfidence, demographic patterns and the level\nof new and existing home sales. Indexing\nStrategy/Index Tracking Risk . Each Fund is\nmanaged with an indexing investment strategy,\nattempting to track the performance of an\nunmanaged index of securities. Each Fund will\nseek to replicate Index returns, regardless of\nthe current or projected performance of the\nIndex or of the actual securities comprising\nthe Index. This differs from an actively-\nmanaged fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. Each Fund\ngenerally will buy and will not sell a\nsecurity included in the Index as long as the\nsecurity is part of the Index regardless of\nany sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the\nsecurity, even though the Adviser may make a\ndifferent investment decision for other\nactively managed accounts or portfolios that\nhold the security. As a result, a Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms and\nby comparison with other indices) and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index\nin accordance with its methodology may occur\nfrom time to time and may not be identified\nand corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on a Fund and its shareholders.\nWhile the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with the Index), a\nFund's return may not match the return of the\nIndex for a number of reasons. For example,\nthe return on the sample of securities\npurchased by a Fund (or the return on 299\nTable of Contents securities not included in\nthe Index) to replicate the performance of the\nIndex may not correlate precisely with the\nreturn of the Index. Each Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, a Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, either as a result of\ncash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves\nof cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may attempt to track the Index\nreturn by investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between a\nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes\nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact a Fund's ability\nto match the return of the Index. The Adviser\nmay apply one or more \u201cscreens\u201d or investment\ntechniques to refine or limit the number or\ntypes of issuers included in the Index in\nwhich a Fund may invest. Application of such\nscreens or techniques may result in investment\nperformance below that of the Index and may\nnot produce results expected by the Adviser.\nIndex tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. Pursuant to each\nIndex methodology, a security may be removed\nfrom an Index in the event that it does not\ncomply with the eligibility requirements of\nthe Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced\nto sell securities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the\nIndex components. When there are changes made\nto the component securities of an Index and\nthe corresponding Fund in turn makes similar\nchanges to its portfolio to attempt to\nincrease the correlation between the Fund's\nportfolio and the Index, any transaction costs\nand market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by\nthe Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled\nchanges to an Index may expose the\ncorresponding Fund to additional tracking\nerror risk. A Fund may recognize gains as a\nresult of rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the corresponding\nIndex. A Fund also may be required to\ndistribute any such gains to its shareholders\nto avoid adverse federal income tax\nconsequences. Industrial Sector Risk .\nIndustrial companies are affected by supply\nand demand both for their specific product or\nservice and for industrial sector products in\ngeneral. Government regulation, world events,\nexchange rates and economic conditions,\ntechnological developments and liabilities for\nenvironmental damage and general civil\nliabilities will likewise affect the\nperformance of these companies. Aerospace and\ndefense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry\nrely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products\nand services. Thus, the financial condition\nof, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which\nare typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol the U.S. (and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation securities, a\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are\ncyclical and have occasional sharp price\nmovements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Infrastructure-Related\nCompanies Risk . Infrastructure-related\ncompanies include companies that primarily\nown, manage, develop and/or operate\ninfrastructure assets, including\ntransportation, utility, energy and/or\ntelecommunications assets. Infrastructure-\nrelated businesses are subject to a variety of\nfactors that may adversely affect their\nbusiness or operations, including high\ninterest costs in connection with capital\nconstruction programs, insurance costs, costs\nassociated with environmental and other\nregulations, the effects of an economic\nslowdown, surplus capacity or technological\nobsolescence, industry competition, labor\nrelations, rate caps or rate changes,\nuncertainties concerning availability of fuel\nat reasonable prices, the effects of energy\nconservation policies, natural disasters,\nterrorist attacks and other factors. Certain\ninfrastructure-related entities, particularly\ntelecommunications and utilities companies,\nare subject to extensive regulation by various\ngovernmental authorities. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failures to receive required\nregulatory approvals or the enactment of new\nadverse regulatory requirements may adversely\naffect infrastructure-related companies.\nInfrastructure-related companies may also be\naffected by service interruption and/or legal\nchallenges due to environmental, operational\nor other conditions or events, and the\nimposition of special tariffs and changes in\ntax laws, regulatory policies and accounting\nstandards. There is also the risk that\ncorruption may negatively affect publicly-\nfunded infrastructure projects, especially in\nnon-U.S. markets, resulting in work stoppage,\ndelays and cost overruns. Other risks\nassociated with infrastructure-related\ncompanies include uncertainties resulting from\nsuch companies' diversification into new\ndomestic and international businesses, as well\nas agreements by any such companies linking\nfuture rate increases to inflation or other\nfactors not directly related to the actual\noperating profits of the enterprise. 300 Table\nof Contents Insurance Companies Risk .\nInsurance companies' profits are affected by\nmany factors, including interest rate\nmovements, the imposition of premium rate\ncaps, competition and pressure to compete\nglobally. Certain types of insurance companies\nmay also be affected by weather catastrophes\nand other disasters and mortality rates. In\naddition, although insurance companies are\ncurrently subject to extensive regulation,\nsuch companies may be adversely affected by\nincreased governmental regulations or tax law\nchanges in the future. Internet Segment Risk .\nInternet companies are subject to rapid\nchanges in technology, worldwide competition,\nrapid obsolescence of products and services,\nloss of patent protections, cyclical market\npatterns, evolving industry standards and\nfrequent new product introductions.\nCompetitive pressures, such as technological\ndevelopments, fixed-rate pricing and the\nability to attract and retain skilled\nemployees, can significantly affect internet\ncompanies, and changing domestic and\ninternational demand, research and development\ncosts, availability and price components and\nproduct obsolescence also can affect their\nprofitability. Large-Capitalization Securities\nRisk. Securities issued by large-\ncapitalization companies may present risks not\npresent in smaller companies. For example,\nlarger companies may be unable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in\nbusiness, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able\nto maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-\nsized companies, especially during strong\neconomic periods. Returns on investments in\nsecurities of large companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of\nsmaller and mid-sized companies. Leveraging\nRisk . Borrowing transactions, reverse\nrepurchase agreements, certain derivatives\ntransactions, securities lending transactions\nand other investment transactions such as\nwhen-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward\ncommitment transactions may create investment\nleverage. If a Fund engages in transactions\nthat have a leveraging effect on the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, the value of the Fund\nwill be potentially more volatile and all\nother risks will tend to be compounded. This\nis because leverage generally creates\ninvestment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than a Fund would otherwise have and\nso magnifies the effect of any increase or\ndecrease in the value of the Fund's underlying\nassets. The use of leverage is considered to\nbe a speculative investment practice and may\nresult in losses to a Fund. Certain\nderivatives have the potential for unlimited\nloss, regardless of the size of the initial\ninvestment. The use of leverage may cause a\nFund to liquidate positions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy repayment,\ninterest payment, or margin obligations or to\nmeet asset segregation or coverage\nrequirements. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk\nis the risk that a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of securities or close out derivatives\ntransactions readily at a favorable time or\nprices (or at all) or at prices approximating\nthose at which a Fund currently values them.\nFor example, certain investments may be\nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade\nin the over-the-counter market or in limited\nvolume, or may not have an active trading\nmarket. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for a Fund to value illiquid\ninvestments accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. If the liquidity of a\nFund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to\ndifferences between the market price of Fund\nShares and the net asset value of Fund Shares,\nand could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Disposal of illiquid investments may\nentail registration expenses and other\ntransaction costs that are higher than those\nfor liquid securities. A Fund may seek to\nborrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of\nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing\nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund.\nLow Volatility Risk. Although subject to the\nrisks of common stocks, low volatility stocks\nare seen as having a lower risk profile than\nthe overall markets. However, a portfolio\ncomprised of low volatility stocks may not\nproduce investment exposure that has lower\nvariability to changes in such stocks' price\nlevels. Low volatility stocks are likely to\nunderperform the broader market during periods\nof rapidly rising stock prices. Market Risk .\nMarket prices of investments held by a Fund\nwill go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. A Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile,\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in a\nFund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\n301 Table of Contents political, regulatory\nand tax changes also may cause fluctuations in\nmarkets and securities prices. Local, regional\nor global events such as war, acts of\nterrorism, the spread of infectious illness or\nother public health issues, or other events\ncould have a significant impact on a Fund and\nits investments. An outbreak of a respiratory\ndisease caused by a novel coronavirus (known\nas COVID-19) first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has resulted in a global\npandemic and major disruptions to economies\nand markets around the world, including the\nUnited States. Financial markets experienced\nand may continue to experience extreme\nvolatility and severe losses, and trading in\nmany instruments was and may continue to be\ndisrupted as a result. Liquidity for many\ninstruments was and may continue to be greatly\nreduced for periods of time. Some interest\nrates are very low and in some cases yields\nare negative. Governments and central banks,\nincluding the Federal Reserve in the United\nStates, have taken extraordinary and\nunprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.\nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some\ntime. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19,\nand measures taken to mitigate its effects,\ncould result in disruptions to the services\nprovided to a Fund by its service providers.\nMaterials Sector Risk. Many materials\ncompanies are significantly affected by the\nlevel and volatility of commodity prices,\nexchange rates, import controls, worldwide\ncompetition, environmental policies and\nconsumer demand. At times, worldwide\nproduction of industrial materials has\nexceeded demand as a result of over-building\nor economic downturns, leading to poor\ninvestment returns or losses. Other risks may\ninclude liabilities for environmental damage\nand general civil liabilities, depletion of\nresources, and mandated expenditures for\nsafety and pollution control. The materials\nsector may also be affected by economic\ncycles, technical progress, labor relations,\nand government regulations. Metals and Mining\nCompanies Risk. Metals and mining companies\ncan be significantly affected by events\nrelating to international political and\neconomic developments, energy conservation,\nthe success of exploration projects, commodity\nprices, and tax and other government\nregulations. Investments in metals and mining\ncompanies may be speculative and may be\nsubject to greater price volatility than\ninvestments in other types of companies. Risks\nof metals and mining investments include:\nchanges in international monetary policies or\neconomic and political conditions that can\naffect the supply of precious metals and\nconsequently the value of metals and mining\ncompany investments; the United States or\nforeign governments may pass laws or\nregulations limiting metals investments for\nstrategic or other policy reasons; and\nincreased environmental or labor costs may\ndepress the value of metals and mining\ninvestments. Mid-Capitalization Securities\nRisk . The securities of mid-capitalization\ncompanies may be more volatile and may involve\nmore risk than the securities of larger\ncompanies. These companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets or financial resources,\nmay lack the competitive strength of larger\ncompanies, and may depend on a few key\nemployees. In addition, these companies may\nhave been recently organized and may have\nlittle or no track record of success. The\nsecurities of mid-sized companies may trade\nless frequently and in smaller volumes than\nmore widely held securities. The prices of\nthese securities may fluctuate more sharply\nthan those of other securities, and a Fund may\nexperience some difficulty in establishing or\nclosing out positions in these securities at\nprevailing market prices. There may be less\npublicly available information about the\nissuers of these securities or less market\ninterest in these securities than in the case\nof larger companies, both of which can cause\nsignificant price volatility. Some securities\nof mid-sized issuers may be illiquid or may be\nrestricted as to resale. Returns on\ninvestments in securities of mid-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of larger\nor smaller companies. Momentum Risk . The Fund\nemploys a \u201cmomentum\u201d style of investing that\nemphasizes investing in securities that have\nhad higher recent price performance compared\nto other securities. This style of investing\nis subject to the risk that these securities\nmay be more volatile than a broad cross-\nsection of securities or that the returns on\nsecurities that have previously exhibited\nprice momentum are less than returns on other\nstyles of investing or the overall stock\nmarket. Momentum can turn quickly and cause\nsignificant variation from other types of\ninvestments. New Economies Companies Risk .\nThe companies included in the Index are\nengaged in emerging industries and new\ntechnologies that may be unproven. Such\nindustries and technologies may be adversely\naffected by technological advances,\ncompetition, rapid product or service\nobsolescence, and new and evolving\nregulations. Companies included in the Index\nmay rely on a combination of patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws\nto establish and 302 Table of Contents protect\ntheir proprietary rights in their products and\ntechnologies, and may be adversely affected by\nloss or impairment of those rights. In\naddition, companies in the Index may have\nlimited product lines, markets, financial\nresources or personnel. The Index may include\nstocks of smaller, less-seasoned companies\nthat may be more volatile than the overall\nmarket. Non-Diversification Risk . Funds\nclassified as \u201cnon-diversified\u201d may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent a Fund invests\nin a relatively small number of issuers, a\ndecline in the market value of a particular\nsecurity held by the Fund may affect its value\nmore than if it invested in a larger number of\nissuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more\nvolatile than the values of shares of more\ndiversified funds. A diversified Fund may\nbecome non-diversified for periods of time\nsolely as a result of tracking its Index\n(e.g., changes in weightings of one or more\ncomponent securities). Non-U.S. Securities\nRisk . Investments in securities of non-U.S.\nissuers (including depositary receipts) entail\nrisks not typically associated with investing\nin securities of U.S. issuers. Similar risks\nmay apply to securities traded on a U.S.\nsecurities exchange that are issued by\nentities with significant exposure to non-U.S.\ncountries. In certain countries, legal\nremedies available to investors may be more\nlimited than those available with regard to\nU.S. investments. Because non-U.S. securities\nare typically denominated and traded in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, the\nvalue of the Fund's assets, to the extent they\nare non-U.S. dollar denominated, may be\naffected favorably or unfavorably by currency\nexchange rates, exchange control regulations,\nand restrictions or prohibitions on the\nrepatriation of non-U.S. currencies. To the\nextent underlying securities held by the Fund\ntrade on foreign exchanges that are closed\nwhen the exchange on which the Fund's shares\ntrade is open, there may be deviations between\nthe current price of an underlying security\nand the last quoted price for the underlying\nsecurity on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums or discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that invest in domestic\nsecurities. Income and gains with respect to\ninvestments in certain countries may be\nsubject to withholding and other taxes. There\nmay be less information publicly available\nabout a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S.\nentity, and many non-U.S. entities are not\nsubject to accounting, auditing, and financial\nreporting standards, regulatory framework and\npractices comparable to those in the United\nStates. The securities of some non-U.S.\nentities are less liquid and at times more\nvolatile than securities of comparable U.S.\nentities, and could become subject to\nsanctions or embargoes that adversely affect a\nFund's investment. Non-U.S. transaction costs,\nsuch as brokerage commissions and custody\ncosts may be higher than in the U.S. In\naddition, there may be a possibility of\nnationalization or expropriation of assets,\nimposition of currency exchange controls,\nconfiscatory taxation, and diplomatic\ndevelopments that could adversely affect the\nvalues of a Fund's investments in certain\nnon-U.S. countries. Investments in securities\nof non-U.S. issuers also are subject to\nforeign political and economic risk not\nassociated with U.S. investments, meaning that\npolitical events (civil unrest, national\nelections, changes in political conditions and\nforeign relations, imposition of exchange\ncontrols and repatriation restrictions),\nsocial and economic events (labor strikes,\nrising inflation) and natural disasters\noccurring in a country where a Fund invests\ncould cause the Fund's investments in that\ncountry to experience gains or losses. Oil and\nGas Companies Risk . Oil and gas companies\ndevelop and produce crude oil and natural gas\nand provide drilling and other energy\nresources production and distribution related\nservices. Stock prices for these types of\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand\nboth for their specific product or service and\nfor energy products in general. The price of\noil and gas, exploration and production\nspending, government regulation, world events\nand economic conditions will likewise affect\nthe performance of these companies.\nCorrespondingly, securities of companies in\nthe energy field are subject to swift price\nand supply fluctuations caused by events\nrelating to international politics, energy\nconservation, the success of exploration\nprojects, and tax and other governmental\nregulatory policies. Weak demand for the\ncompanies' products or services or for energy\nproducts and services in general, as well as\nnegative developments in these other areas,\nwould adversely impact the Fund's performance.\nOil and gas equipment and services can be\nsignificantly affected by natural disasters as\nwell as changes in exchange rates, interest\nrates, government regulation, world events and\neconomic conditions. These companies may be at\nrisk for environmental damage claims.\nPharmaceuticals Companies Risk .\nPharmaceutical companies are heavily dependent\non patent protection. The expiration of\npatents may adversely affect the profitability\nof the companies. Pharmaceutical companies are\nalso subject to extensive litigation based on\nproduct liability and other similar claims.\nMany new products are subject to 303 Table of\nContents approval of the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The process of\nobtaining FDA approval can be long and costly\nand approved products are susceptible to\nobsolescence. Pharmaceutical companies are\nalso subject to heavy competitive forces that\nmay make it difficult to raise prices and, in\nfact, may result in price discounting.\nPreferred Securities Risk . Generally,\npreferred security holders have no or limited\nvoting rights with respect to the issuing\ncompany. In addition, preferred securities are\ngenerally senior to common stock, but may be\nsubordinated to bonds and other debt\ninstruments in a company's capital structure\nand therefore may be subject to greater credit\nrisk than those debt instruments. In the event\nan issuer of preferred securities experiences\neconomic difficulties, the issuer's preferred\nsecurities may lose substantial value due to\nthe increased likelihood of deferred interest\nor dividend payments and the fact that the\npreferred security may be subordinated to\nother securities of the same issuer. Further,\nbecause many preferred securities pay interest\nor dividends at a fixed rate, their market\nprice can be sensitive to changes in interest\nrates in a manner similar to bonds - that is,\nas interest rates rise, the value of the\npreferred securities held by a Fund are likely\nto decline. Therefore, to the extent that a\nFund invests a substantial portion of its\nassets in fixed rate preferred securities,\nrising interest rates may cause the value of\nthe Fund's investments to decline\nsignificantly. In addition, to the extent\npreferred securities allow holders to convert\nthe preferred securities into common stock of\nthe issuer, their market price can be\nsensitive to changes in the value of the\nissuer's common stock and, therefore,\ndeclining common stock values may also cause\nthe value of a Fund's investments to decline.\nPreferred securities often have call features\nwhich allow the issuer to redeem the security\nat its discretion. The redemption of a\npreferred security having a higher than\naverage yield may cause a decrease in a Fund's\nyield. Quality Risk . A \u201cquality\u201d style of\ninvesting emphasizes companies with high\nreturns on equity, stable earnings per share\ngrowth, and low financial leverage. This style\nof investing is subject to the risk that the\npast performance of these companies does not\ncontinue or that the returns on \u201cquality\u201d\nequity securities are less than returns on\nother styles of investing or the overall stock\nmarket. Real Estate Sector Risk . There are\nspecial risks associated with investment in\nsecurities of companies engaged in real\nproperty markets, including without limitation\nreal estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) and\nreal estate operating companies. An investment\nin a real property company may be subject to\nrisks similar to those associated with direct\nownership of real estate, including, by way of\nexample, the possibility of declines in the\nvalue of real estate, losses from casualty or\ncondemnation, and changes in local and general\neconomic conditions, supply and demand,\ninterest rates, environmental liability,\nzoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents,\nproperty taxes, and operating expenses. An\ninvestment in a real property company is\nsubject to additional risks, such as poor\nperformance by the manager of the real\nproperty company, adverse changes in tax laws,\ndifficulties in valuing and disposing of real\nestate, and the effect of general declines in\nstock prices. Some real property companies\nhave limited diversification because they\ninvest in a limited number of properties, a\nnarrow geographic area, or a single type of\nproperty. Also, the organizational documents\nof a real property company may contain\nprovisions that make changes in control of the\ncompany difficult and time-consuming. As a\nshareholder in a real property company, a\nFund, and indirectly a Fund's shareholders,\nwould bear their ratable shares of the real\nproperty company's expenses and would at the\nsame time continue to pay their own fees and\nexpenses. REIT Risk . REITs are subject to the\nrisks associated with investing in the real\nestate sector in general. In particular, a\nREIT may be affected by changes in the values\nof the properties that the REIT owns or\noperates or that underlie the mortgages or\nsimilar real estate interests in which the\nREIT invests. In addition, REITs may be\naffected by changes to interest rates or\nproperty taxes. Further, REITs are dependent\nupon specialized management skills, and their\ninvestments may be concentrated in relatively\nfew properties, or in a small geographic area\nor a single property type. REITs are also\nsubject to heavy cash flow dependency and, as\na result, are particularly reliant on the\nproper functioning of capital markets. In the\nevent of a default by a borrower or lessee,\nthe REIT may experience delays in enforcing\nits rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may\nincur substantial costs associated with\nprotecting its investments. Investments in\nREITs are also subject to the risks affecting\nequity markets generally. In addition, a REIT\ncould fail to qualify for favorable tax or\nregulatory treatment, which could have adverse\nconsequences for a Fund. Smaller\ncapitalization REITs may be more volatile and\nmay involve more risk than larger\ncapitalization REITs. Equity REITs earn income\nfrom leasing properties and realize gains and\nlosses from the sale of properties. Equity\nREITs may be affected by conditions in the\nreal estate rental market and by changes in\nthe value of the properties they own. A\ndecline in rental income may occur because of\nextended vacancies, limitations on rents,\nfailure to collect rents or increased\ncompetition from other rental properties. In\naddition, rising interest rates may increase\nthe costs of obtaining financing for real\nestate projects, which may cause the value of\nan equity REIT to decline. Mortgage REITs\nreceive 304 Table of Contents principal and\ninterest payments from the owners of mortgage\nproperties. Accordingly, mortgage REITs are\nsubject to the credit risk of the borrowers,\nwhich refers to the possibility that the\nborrower will be unable and/or unwilling to\nmake timely interest payments and/or repay the\nprincipal on the loan to the mortgage REIT\nwhen due. If a mortgage REIT is required to\nforeclose on a borrower, the amount recovered\nin connection with the foreclosure may be less\nthan the amount owed to the mortgage REIT. In\naddition, if a borrower refinances or prepays\na mortgage, a mortgage REIT's yield may\ndecline. Retail Companies Risk . Retail\ncompanies can be significantly affected by the\nperformance of the domestic and international\neconomy, consumer confidence and spending,\nintense competition, changes in demographics,\nand changing consumer tastes and preferences.\nSemiconductor Companies Risk. A Fund is\nsubject to the risk that market or economic\nfactors impacting semiconductor companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of\nstocks of semiconductor companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology is\nparticularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\nproduct cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, including\ncompetition from foreign competitors with\nlower production costs. Semiconductor\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies, tend to be more volatile\nthan the overall market. Additionally,\nsemiconductor companies may face dramatic and\noften unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified\npersonnel. Settlement Risk . Markets in\ndifferent countries have different clearance\nand settlement procedures and in certain\nmarkets there have been times when settlements\nhave been unable to keep pace with the volume\nof transactions. Delays in settlement may\nincrease credit risk to a Fund, limit the\nability of a Fund to reinvest the proceeds of\na sale of securities, hinder the ability of a\nFund to lend its portfolio securities, and\npotentially subject a Fund to penalties for\nits failure to deliver to on-purchasers of\nsecurities whose delivery to a Fund was\ndelayed. Delays in the settlement of\nsecurities purchased by a Fund may limit the\nability of a Fund to sell those securities at\ntimes and prices it considers desirable, and\nmay subject a Fund to losses and costs due to\nits own inability to settle with subsequent\npurchasers of the securities from it. A Fund\nmay be required to borrow monies it had\notherwise expected to receive in connection\nwith the settlement of securities sold by it,\nin order to meet its obligations to others.\nLimits on the ability of a Fund to purchase or\nsell securities due to settlement delays could\nincrease any variance between a Fund's\nperformance and that of its benchmark index.\nSmall-Capitalization Securities Risk . The\nsecurities of small-capitalization companies\nmay be more volatile and may involve more risk\nthan the securities of larger companies. These\ncompanies may have limited product lines,\nmarkets or financial resources, may lack the\ncompetitive strength of larger companies, and\nmay depend on a few key employees. In\naddition, these companies may have been\nrecently organized and may have little or no\ntrack record of success. The securities of\nsmaller companies may trade less frequently\nand in smaller volumes than more widely held\nsecurities. The prices of these securities may\nfluctuate more sharply than those of other\nsecurities, and a Fund may experience some\ndifficulty in establishing or closing out\npositions in these securities at prevailing\nmarket prices. There may be less publicly\navailable information about the issuers of\nthese securities or less market interest in\nthese securities than in the case of larger\ncompanies, both of which can cause significant\nprice volatility. Some securities of smaller\nissuers may be illiquid or may be restricted\nas to resale. A Fund may be unable to\nliquidate its positions in such securities at\nany time, or at a favorable price, in order to\nmeet a Fund's obligations. Returns on\ninvestments in securities of small-\ncapitalization companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of larger\ncompanies. Technology Sector Risk . Market or\neconomic factors impacting technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnological advances could have a major\neffect on the value of the Fund's investments.\nThe value of stocks of technology companies\nand companies that rely heavily on technology\nis particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from\nforeign competitors with lower production\ncosts. Technology companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than the\noverall market. Technology companies are\nheavily dependent on patent and intellectual\nproperty rights, the loss or impairment of\nwhich may adversely affect profitability.\nAdditionally, companies in the technology\nsector may face dramatic and often\nunpredictable changes in growth rates and\ncompetition for the services of qualified\npersonnel. 305 Table of Contents Electronic\nMedia Companies Risk: Electronic media\ncompanies create, own, and distribute various\nforms of technology-based visual, audio, and\ninteractive content, as well as information\ndatabases that they sell or lease to others.\nElectronic media companies can be adversely\naffected by, among other things, changes in\ngovernment regulation, intense competition,\ndependency on patent protection, and rapid\nobsolescence of products and services due to\nproduct compatibility or changing consumer\npreferences. Telecommunications Sector Risk.\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to\nextensive government regulation. The costs of\ncomplying with governmental regulations,\ndelays or failure to receive required\nregulatory approvals or the enactment of new\nadverse regulatory requirements may adversely\naffect the business of the telecommunications\ncompanies. The telecommunications industry can\nalso be significantly affected by intense\ncompetition, including competition with\nalternative technologies such as wireless\ncommunications, product compatibility,\nconsumer preferences, rapid product\nobsolescence and research and development of\nnew products. Technological innovations may\nmake the products and services of\ntelecommunications companies obsolete. Other\nrisks include uncertainties resulting from\nsuch companies' diversification into new\ndomestic and international businesses, as well\nas agreements by any such companies linking\nfuture rate increases to inflation or other\nfactors not directly related to the actual\noperating profits of the enterprise.\nTransportation Companies Risk. Transportation\ncompanies can be significantly affected by\nchanges in the economy, fuel prices, labor\nrelations, technology developments, exchange\nrates, insurance costs, industry competition\nand government regulation. Unconstrained\nSector Risk . A Fund may invest a substantial\nportion of its assets within one or more\neconomic sectors or industries, which may\nchange from time to time. When a Fund focuses\nits investments in a particular industry or\nsector, financial, economic, business, and\nother developments affecting issuers in that\nindustry, market, or economic sector will have\na greater effect on the Fund than if it had\nnot focused its assets in that industry,\nmarket, or economic sector, which may increase\nthe volatility of the Fund. Utilities Sector\nRisk. Utility companies are affected by supply\nand demand, operating costs, government\nregulation, environmental factors, liabilities\nfor environmental damage and general civil\nliabilities, and rate caps or rate changes.\nAlthough rate changes of a utility usually\nfluctuate in approximate correlation with\nfinancing costs, due to political and\nregulatory factors, rate changes ordinarily\noccur only following a delay after the changes\nin financing costs. This factor will tend to\nfavorably affect a regulated utility company's\nearnings and dividends in times of decreasing\ncosts, but conversely, will tend to adversely\naffect earnings and dividends when costs are\nrising. The value of regulated utility debt\nsecurities (and, to a lesser extent, equity\nsecurities) may tend to have an inverse\nrelationship to the movement of interest\nrates. Certain utility companies have\nexperienced full or partial deregulation in\nrecent years. These utility companies are\nfrequently more similar to industrial\ncompanies in that they are subject to greater\ncompetition and have been permitted by\nregulators to diversify outside of their\noriginal geographic regions and their\ntraditional lines of business. These\nopportunities may permit certain utility\ncompanies to earn more than their traditional\nregulated rates of return. Some companies,\nhowever, may be forced to defend their core\nbusiness and may be less profitable. In\naddition, natural disasters, terrorist\nattacks, government intervention or other\nfactors may render a utility company's\nequipment unusable or obsolete and negatively\nimpact profitability. Among the risks that may\naffect utility companies are the following:\nrisks of increases in fuel and other operating\ncosts; the high cost of borrowing to finance\ncapital construction during inflationary\nperiods; restrictions on operations and\nincreased costs and delays associated with\ncompliance with environmental and nuclear\nsafety regulations; and the difficulties\ninvolved in obtaining natural gas for resale\nor fuel for generating electricity at\nreasonable prices. Other risks include those\nrelated to the construction and operation of\nnuclear power plants, the effects of energy\nconservation and the effects of regulatory\nchanges. Valuation Risk . Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of a\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. Technological issues or other service\ndisruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause a Fund to value\nits investments 306 Table of Contents\nincorrectly. In addition, there is no\nassurance that a Fund could sell or close out\na portfolio position for the value established\nfor it at any time, and it is possible that a\nFund would incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by a Fund at that\ntime. Value Stock Risk. Value stocks present\nthe risk that they may decline in price or\nnever reach their expected full market value\nbecause the market fails to recognize the\nstock's intrinsic worth. Value stocks may\nunderperform growth stocks and stocks in other\nbroad style categories (and the stock market\nas a whole) over any period of time and may\nshift in and out of favor with investors\ngenerally, sometimes rapidly, depending on\nchanges in market, economic, and other\nfactors. As a result, at times when it holds\nsubstantial investments in value stocks a Fund\nmay underperform other investment portfolios\nthat invest more broadly or that favor\ndifferent investment styles. Non-Principal\nRisks Each risk discussed below is a non-\nprincipal risk of a Fund to the extent it is\nnot identified as a principal risk for such\nFund in the preceding \u201cADDITIONAL RISK\nINFORMATION - PRINCIPAL RISKS\u201d section.\nAuthorized Participants, Market Makers and\nLiquidity Providers Concentration Risk. A Fund\nhas a limited number of financial institutions\nthat may act as Authorized Participants\n(\u201cAPs\u201d), which are responsible for the\ncreation and redemption activity for a Fund.\nIn addition, there may be a limited number of\nmarket makers and/or liquidity providers in\nthe marketplace. To the extent either of the\nfollowing events occur, Fund Shares may trade\nat a material discount to NAV and possibly\nface delisting: (i) APs exit the business or\notherwise become unable to process creation\nand/or redemption orders and no other APs step\nforward to perform these services, or (ii)\nmarket makers and/or liquidity providers exit\nthe business or significantly reduce their\nbusiness activities and no other entities step\nforward to perform their functions. Cash\nTransaction Risk . To the extent a Fund sells\nportfolio securities to meet some or all of a\nredemption request with cash, the Fund may\nincur taxable gains or losses that it might\nnot have incurred had it made redemptions\nentirely in-kind. As a result, a Fund may pay\nout higher annual capital gain distributions\nthan if the in-kind redemption process was\nused. Concentration Risk. A Fund's assets may\nbe concentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the extent that the\nFund's underlying Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nWhen a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a\nFund will be subject to a number of actual or\npotential conflicts of interest. For example,\nthe Adviser or its affiliates may provide\nservices to a Fund, such as securities lending\nagency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer\nagency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for\nwhich the Fund would compensate the Adviser\nand/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest\nin other pooled investment vehicles sponsored,\nmanaged, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of a\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements. The Adviser and its\naffiliates serve as investment adviser to\nother clients and may make investment\ndecisions that may be different from those\nthat will be made by the Adviser on behalf of\nthe Funds. For example, the Adviser may\nprovide asset allocation advice to some\nclients that may include a recommendation to\ninvest in or redeem from particular issuers\nwhile not providing that same recommendation\nto all clients invested in the same or similar\nissuers. The Adviser may (subject to\napplicable law) be simultaneously seeking to\npurchase (or sell) investments for a Fund and\nto sell (or purchase) the same investment for\naccounts, funds, or structured products for\nwhich it serves as asset manager, or for other\nclients or affiliates. The Adviser and its\naffiliates may invest for clients in various\nsecurities that are senior, pari passuor\njunior to, or have interests different from or\nadverse to, the securities that are owned by a\n307 Table of Contents Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material\nnonpublic confidential information that may\nrestrict the Adviser from purchasing\nsecurities or selling securities for itself or\nits clients (including the Funds) or otherwise\nusing such information for the benefit of its\nclients or itself. The foregoing does not\npurport to be a comprehensive list or complete\nexplanation of all potential conflicts of\ninterests which may affect a Fund. A Fund may\nencounter circumstances, or enter into\ntransactions, in which conflicts of interest\nthat are not listed or discussed above may\narise. Costs of Buying and Selling Shares .\nInvestors buying or selling Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market will pay brokerage\ncommissions or other charges imposed by\nbrokers, as determined by that broker.\nBrokerage commissions are often a fixed amount\nand may be a significant proportional cost for\ninvestors seeking to buy or sell relatively\nsmall amounts of Fund Shares. In addition,\nsecondary market investors will also incur the\ncost of the difference between the price that\nan investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares\n(the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which an\ninvestor is willing to sell Fund Shares (the\n\u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask\nprices is often referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or\n\u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies\nover time for Fund Shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and is generally\nlower if Fund Shares have more trading volume\nand market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares\nhave little trading volume and market\nliquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask\nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,\nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may\nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, funds (such as the Funds) and their\nservice providers (including the Adviser) may\nbe prone to operational and information\nsecurity risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. In general,\ncyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects.\nCyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from\naccessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns of, a Fund, the Adviser\nor a custodian, transfer agent, or other\naffiliated or third-party service provider may\nadversely affect a Fund or its shareholders.\nFor instance, cyber-attacks or technical\nmalfunctions may interfere with the processing\nof shareholder or other transactions, affect a\nFund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the\nrelease of private shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial\nlosses, reimbursement or other compensation\ncosts, and additional compliance costs. Cyber-\nattacks or technical malfunctions may render\nrecords of Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and\nother data integral to the functioning of a\nFund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete.\nA Fund may also incur substantial costs for\ncybersecurity risk management in order to\nprevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund\nand its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. While the Adviser has\nestablished business continuity plans and\nsystems designed to minimize the risk of\ncyber-attacks through the use of technology,\nprocesses and controls, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, given the evolving\nnature of this threat. Each Fund relies on\nthird-party service providers for many of its\nday-to-day operations, and will be subject to\nthe risk that the protections and protocols\nimplemented by those service providers will be\nineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-\nattack. The Adviser does not control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems put in place\nby third-party service providers, and such\nthird-party service providers may have limited\nindemnification obligations to the Adviser or\nthe Funds. Similar types of cybersecurity\nrisks or technical malfunctions also are\npresent for issuers of securities in which\neach Fund invests, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such\nissuers, and may cause a Fund's investment in\nsuch securities to lose value. Index\nConstruction Risk . A security included in an\nIndex may not exhibit the characteristic or\nprovide the specific exposure for which it was\nselected and consequently a Fund's holdings\nmay not exhibit returns consistent with that\ncharacteristic or exposure. 308 Table of\nContents Index Licensing Risk . It is possible\nthat the license under which the Adviser or a\nFund is permitted to replicate or otherwise\nuse an Index will be terminated or may be\ndisputed, impaired or cease to remain in\neffect. In such a case, the Adviser may be\nrequired to replace the relevant Index with\nanother index which it considers to be\nappropriate in light of the investment\nstrategy of a Fund. The use of any such\nsubstitute index may have an adverse impact on\na Fund's performance. In the event that the\nAdviser is unable to identify a suitable\nreplacement for the relevant Index, it may\ndetermine to terminate a Fund. Money Market\nRisk . An investment in a money market fund is\nnot a deposit of any bank and is not insured\nor guaranteed by the FDIC or any other\ngovernment agency. Certain money market funds\nseek to preserve the value of their shares at\n$1.00 per share, although there can be no\nassurance that they will do so, and it is\npossible to lose money by investing in such a\nmoney market fund. A major or unexpected\nchange in interest rates or a decline in the\ncredit quality of an issuer or entity\nproviding credit support, an inactive trading\nmarket for money market instruments, or\nadverse market, economic, industry, political,\nregulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions\ncould cause the share price of such a money\nmarket fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will\nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at\ntimes when the fair value of the money market\nfund's portfolio per share is more or less\nthan $1.00. None of State Street Corporation,\nState Street, State Street Global Advisors\n(\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (\u201cState\nStreet Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an\ninvestment in a money market fund at $1.00 per\nshare. Investors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market\nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV\nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the\nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or\nless than their original purchase price.\nRecent changes in the regulation of money\nmarket funds may affect the operations and\nstructures of money market funds. A money\nmarket fund may be permitted or required to\nimpose redemption fees or to impose\nlimitations on redemptions during periods of\nhigh illiquidity in the markets for the\ninvestments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . A Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to a Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nmay have the effect of reducing a Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. A Fund may engage in\nsignificant trading of its portfolio\nsecurities in connection with Index\nrebalancing. Frequent or significant trading\nmay cause a Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent or significant trading.\nSecurities Lending Risk. Each Fund may lend\nportfolio securities in an amount not to\nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the\nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by a\nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a\nloan transaction, as compensation for lending\nits securities, a Fund will receive a portion\nof the dividends or interest accrued on the\nsecurities held as collateral or, in the case\nof cash collateral, a portion of the income\nfrom the investment of such cash. In addition,\na Fund will receive the amount of all\ndividends, interest and other distributions on\nthe loaned securities. However, the borrower\nhas the right to vote the loaned securities. A\nFund will call loans to vote proxies if a\nmaterial issue affecting the investment is to\nbe voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities, and may involve expenses to\na Fund. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. Should the borrower of the securities\nfail financially, a Fund may experience delays\nin recovering the securities or exercising its\nrights in the collateral. Loans are made only\nto borrowers that are deemed by the securities\nlending agent to be of good financial\nstanding. In a loan transaction, a Fund will\nalso bear the risk of any decline in value of\nsecurities provided as collateral or acquired\nwith cash collateral. Each Fund will attempt\nto minimize this risk by limiting the\ninvestment of cash collateral to high quality\ninstruments of short maturity either directly\non behalf of the lending Fund or through one\nor more joint accounts or funds, which may\ninclude those managed by the Adviser. To the\nextent the collateral provided or investments\nmade with cash collateral differ from\nsecurities included in an Index, such\ncollateral or investments may have a greater\nrisk of 309\n\nTable of Contents\n\nloss than the securities included in the\nIndex. In addition, a Fund will be subject to\nthe risk that any income generated by lending\nits securities or reinvesting cash collateral\nis lower than any fees the Fund has agreed to\npay a borrower. The Adviser will take into\naccount the tax impact to shareholders of\nsubstitute payments for dividends when\noverseeing a Fund's securities lending\nactivity. Trading Issues . Although Fund\nShares are listed for trading on the Exchange\nand may be listed or traded on U.S. and\nnon-U.S. stock exchanges other than the\nExchange, there can be no assurance that an\nactive trading market for such Fund Shares\nwill develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange may be halted due to\nmarket conditions or for reasons that, in the\nview of the Exchange, make trading in Fund\nShares inadvisable. In addition, trading in\nFund Shares on the Exchange is subject to\ntrading halts caused by extraordinary market\nvolatility pursuant to Exchange \u201ccircuit\nbreaker\u201d rules. Similar to the shares of\noperating companies listed on a stock\nexchange, Fund Shares may be sold short and\nare therefore subject to the risk of increased\nvolatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While each Fund expects that the\nability of Authorized Participants to create\nand redeem Fund Shares at net asset value\nshould be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of a Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the\ninvestment adviser to each Fund and, subject\nto the oversight of the Board, is responsible\nfor the investment management of each Fund.\nThe Adviser provides an investment management\nprogram for each Fund and manages the\ninvestment of each Fund's assets. The Adviser\nis a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nGlobal Advisors, Inc., which itself is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation. The Adviser is registered with\nthe SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940, as amended. The Adviser and certain\nother affiliates of State Street Corporation\nmake up SSGA. SSGA is one of the world's\nlargest institutional money managers and the\ninvestment management arm of State Street\nCorporation. As of June 30, 2021, the Adviser\nmanaged approximately $788.65 billion in\nassets and SSGA managed approximately $3.90\ntrillion in assets. The Adviser's principal\nbusiness address is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210.

Additional Purchase and Sale\nInformation Fund Shares are listed for\nsecondary trading on the Exchange and\nindividual Fund Shares may only be purchased\nand sold in the secondary market through a\nbroker-dealer. The secondary markets are\nclosed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The\nExchange may close early on the business day\nbefore certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules\nare subject to change without notice. If you\nbuy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you will pay the secondary market\nprice for Fund Shares. In addition, you may\nincur customary brokerage commissions and\ncharges and may pay some or all of the spread\nbetween the bid and the offered price in the\nsecondary market on each leg of a round trip\n(purchase and sale) transaction. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares will fluctuate\ncontinuously throughout trading hours based on\nmarket supply and demand rather than the\nrelevant Fund's net asset value, which is\ncalculated at the end of each business day.\nFund Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nprices that may be above ( i.e., at a premium)\nor below ( i.e., at a discount), to varying\ndegrees, the daily net asset value of Fund\nShares. The trading prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the relevant Fund's\nnet asset value during periods of market\nvolatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares\ncan be issued and redeemed daily in Creation\nUnits, the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts and premiums to net asset value\nshould not be sustained over long periods. The\nExchange will disseminate, every fifteen\nseconds during the regular trading day, an\nindicative optimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d)\nrelating to each Fund. The IOPV calculations\nare estimates of the value of each Fund's net\nasset value per Fund Share. Premiums and\ndiscounts between the IOPV and the market\nprice may occur. This should not be viewed as\na \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset value\nper Fund Share. The IOPV is based on the\ncurrent market value of the published basket\nof portfolio securities and/or cash required\nto be deposited in exchange for a Creation\nUnit and does not necessarily reflect the\nprecise composition of a Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. The IOPV price is\nbased on quotes and closing prices from the\nsecurities' local market converted into U.S.\ndollars at the current currency rates and may\nnot reflect events that occur subsequent to\nthe local market's close. Therefore, the IOPV\nmay not reflect the best possible valuation of\na Fund's current portfolio. Neither the Funds\nnor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are\ninvolved in, or responsible for, the\ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and\nmake no warranty as to their accuracy. 320\nTable of Contents The Funds do not impose any\nrestrictions on the frequency of purchases and\nredemptions; however, the Funds reserve the\nright to reject or limit purchases at any time\nas described in the SAI. When considering that\nno restriction or policy was necessary, the\nBoard evaluated the risks posed by market\ntiming activities, such as whether frequent\npurchases and redemptions would interfere with\nthe efficient implementation of a Fund's\ninvestment strategy, or whether they would\ncause a Fund to experience increased\ntransaction costs. The Board considered that,\nunlike traditional mutual funds, Fund Shares\nare issued and redeemed only in large\nquantities of shares known as Creation Units,\navailable only from a Fund directly, and that\nmost trading in a Fund occurs on the Exchange\nat prevailing market prices and does not\ninvolve the Fund directly. Given this\nstructure, the Board determined that it is\nunlikely that (a) market timing would be\nattempted by a Fund's shareholders or (b) any\nattempts to market time a Fund by shareholders\nwould result in negative impact to the Fund or\nits shareholders. Distributions Dividends and\nCapital Gains. As a Fund shareholder, you are\nentitled to your share of the applicable\nFund's income and net realized gains on its\ninvestments. Each Fund pays out substantially\nall of its net earnings to its shareholders as\n\u201cdistributions.\u201d Each Fund may earn income\ndividends from stocks, interest from debt\nsecurities and, if participating, securities\nlending income. These amounts, net of expenses\nand taxes (if applicable), are passed along to\nFund shareholders as \u201cincome dividend\ndistributions.\u201d Each Fund will generally\nrealize short-term capital gains or losses\nwhenever it sells or exchanges assets held for\none year or less. Net short-term capital gains\nwill generally be treated as ordinary income\nwhen distributed to shareholders. Each Fund\nwill generally realize long-term capital gains\nor losses whenever it sells or exchanges\nassets held for more than one year. Net\ncapital gains (the excess of a Fund's net\nlong-term capital gains over its net short-\nterm capital losses) are distributed to\nshareholders as \u201ccapital gain distributions.\u201d\nIncome dividend distributions, if any, for the\nFunds (except the SPDR ICE Preferred\nSecurities ETF and SPDR MSCI USA\nStrategicFactors SMETF) are generally\ndistributed to shareholders quarterly, but may\nvary significantly from period to period.\nIncome dividend distributions, if any, for the\nSPDR ICE Preferred Securities ETF and SPDR\nMSCI USA StrategicFactors SMETF are generally\ndistributed to shareholders semi-annually and\nmonthly, respectively, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Net\ncapital gains for each Fund are distributed at\nleast annually. Dividends may be declared and\npaid more frequently or at any other time to\nimprove Index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Code. For the\nSPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF, SPDR ICE Preferred\nSecurities ETF, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High\nDividend ETF, SPDR S&P Dividend ETF and SPDR\nS&P Internet ETF: the Funds intend to\ndistribute at least annually amounts\nrepresenting the full dividend yield net of\nexpenses on the underlying investment\nsecurities as if the Fund owned the underlying\ninvestment securities for the entire dividend\nperiod. As a result, some portion of each\ndistribution may result in a return of\ncapital. You will be notified regarding the\nportion of the distribution which represents a\nreturn of capital. Distributions in cash may\nbe reinvested automatically in additional\nwhole Fund Shares only if the broker through\nwhom you purchased Fund Shares makes such\noption available. Distributions which are\nreinvested will nevertheless be taxable to the\nsame extent as if such distributions had not\nbeen reinvested. Portfolio Holdings Disclosure\nThe Funds' portfolio holdings disclosure\npolicy is described in the SAI. In addition,\nthe identities and quantities of the\nsecurities held by each Fund are disclosed on\nthe Funds' website. Additional Tax Information\nThe following discussion is a summary of some\nimportant U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in a Fund. Your investment in a\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes on Distributions.\nIn general, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in a\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from a\nFund will be taxed as either ordinary income\nor qualified dividend income. Subject to\ncertain limitations, 321 Table of Contents\ndividends that are reported by a Fund as\nqualified dividend income are taxable to\nnoncorporate shareholders at reduced rates.\nAny distributions of a Fund's net capital\ngains are taxable as long-term capital gain\nregardless of how long you have owned Fund\nShares. Long-term capital gains are generally\ntaxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced\nrates. Distributions in excess of a Fund's\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits\nare treated as a tax-free return of capital to\nthe extent of your basis in the applicable\nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital\ngain thereafter. In general, dividends may be\nreported by a Fund as qualified dividend\nincome if they are attributable to qualified\ndividend income received by the Fund, which,\nin general, includes dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations and certain foreign\ncorporations ( i.e., certain foreign\ncorporations incorporated in a possession of\nthe United States or in certain countries with\na comprehensive tax treaty with the United\nStates, and certain other foreign corporations\nif the stock with respect to which the\ndividend is paid is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the United\nStates), provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements in respect\nof the stock of such corporations and has not\nhedged its position in the stock in certain\nways. A dividend generally will not be treated\nas qualified dividend income if the dividend\nis received with respect to any share of stock\nheld by a Fund for fewer than 61 days during\nthe 121-day period beginning at the date which\nis 60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, for fewer than 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning 90 days before such\ndate. These holding period requirements will\nalso apply to your ownership of Fund Shares.\nHolding periods may be suspended for these\npurposes for stock that is hedged.\nAdditionally, income derived in connection\nwith a Fund's securities lending activities\nwill not be treated as qualified dividend\nincome. U.S. individuals with income exceeding\nspecified thresholds are subject to a 3.8%\nMedicare contribution tax on all or a portion\nof their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which\nincludes taxable interest, dividends and\ncertain capital gains (generally including\ncapital gain distributions and capital gains\nrealized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This\n3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of\nthe undistributed net investment income of\ncertain shareholders that are estates and\ntrusts. Certain tax-exempt educational\ninstitutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on\nnet investment income. For these purposes,\ncertain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. If you lend your Fund\nShares pursuant to securities lending\narrangements you may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares are\nheld by the borrower) as qualified dividend\nincome. You should consult your financial\nintermediary or tax advisor to discuss your\nparticular circumstances. Distributions paid\nin January, but declared by a Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year,\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth, may be taxable to you in the calendar\nyear in which they were declared. The Funds\nwill inform you of the amount of your ordinary\nincome dividends, qualified dividend income\nand capital gain distributions shortly after\nthe close of each calendar year. A\ndistribution will reduce a Fund's net asset\nvalue per Fund Share and may be taxable to you\nas ordinary income or capital gain even\nthough, from an investment standpoint, the\ndistribution may constitute a return of\ncapital. Derivatives and Other Complex\nSecurities. A Fund may invest in complex\nsecurities. These investments may be subject\nto numerous special and complex rules. These\nrules could affect whether gains and losses\nrecognized by a Fund are treated as ordinary\nincome or capital gain, accelerate the\nrecognition of income to a Fund and/or defer a\nFund's ability to recognize losses. In turn,\nthese rules may affect the amount, timing or\ncharacter of the income distributed to you by\na Fund. You should consult your personal tax\nadvisor regarding the application of these\nrules. Master Limited Partnerships.\nDepreciation or other cost recovery deductions\nfrom a Fund's investments in MLPs in a given\nyear will generally reduce the Fund's taxable\nincome, but those deductions may be recaptured\nin the Fund's income in one or more subsequent\nyears. When recognized and distributed,\nrecapture income will generally be taxable to\nshareholders at the time of the distribution\nat ordinary income tax rates, even though the\nshareholders at that time might not have held\nFund Shares at the time the deductions were\ntaken by the Fund, and even though those\nshareholders will not have corresponding\neconomic gain on their Fund Shares at the time\nof the recapture. In order to distribute\nrecapture income or to fund redemption\nrequests, the Fund may need to liquidate\ninvestments, which may lead to additional\nrecapture income. The Fund's investments in\nMLPs and related entities treated as\npartnerships for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes potentially will result in\ndistributions from the corresponding Fund\nbeing treated as 322 Table of Contents return-\nof-capital distributions, which are not\nincluded in a shareholder's income but which\nreduce the shareholder's tax basis in his or\nher Fund Shares and therefore increase gains\nor decrease losses on dispositions of those\nFund Shares. The Fund's investments in MLPs or\nrelated entities treated as partnerships for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes may also\ncause the corresponding Fund to recognize\ntaxable income on investments in excess of the\ncash generated thereby, and may therefore\nrequire the Fund to sell investments,\nincluding when not otherwise advantageous to\ndo so, in order for the Fund to satisfy the\ndistribution requirements for treatment as a\nregulated investment company. Noncorporate\ntaxpayers are generally eligible for a\ndeduction of up to 20% of \u201cqualified publicly\ntraded partnership income.\u201d The fund will not\nbe able to claim such a deduction in respect\nof income allocated to it by any MLPs or other\npublicly traded partnerships in which it\ninvests, and shareholders will not be able to\nclaim such a deduction in respect of Fund\ndividends attributable to any such income.\nForeign Currency Transactions. A Fund's\ntransactions in foreign currencies, foreign\ncurrency denominated debt obligations and\ncertain foreign currency options, futures\ncontracts and forward contracts (and similar\ninstruments) may give rise to ordinary income\nor loss to the extent such income or loss\nresults from fluctuations in the value of the\nforeign currency concerned. Foreign Income\nTaxes. Investment income received by a Fund\nfrom sources within foreign countries may be\nsubject to foreign income taxes withheld at\nthe source. The United States has entered into\ntax treaties with many foreign countries which\nmay entitle a Fund to a reduced rate of such\ntaxes or exemption from taxes on such income.\nIt is impossible to determine the effective\nrate of foreign tax for a Fund in advance\nsince the amount of the assets to be invested\nwithin various countries is not known. If more\nthan 50% of the total assets of a Fund at the\nclose of its taxable year consist of certain\nforeign stocks or securities, the Fund may\nelect to \u201cpass through\u201d to you certain foreign\nincome taxes (including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund. If a Fund in which you hold\nFund Shares makes such an election, you will\nbe considered to have received as an\nadditional dividend your share of such foreign\ntaxes, but you may be entitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in calculating\nyour taxable income, or, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in calculating your\nfederal income tax. No deduction for such\ntaxes will be permitted to individuals in\ncomputing their alternative minimum tax\nliability. If a Fund does not so elect, the\nFund will be entitled to claim a deduction for\ncertain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund.\nUnder certain circumstances, if a Fund\nreceives a refund of foreign taxes paid in\nrespect of a prior year, the value of Fund\nShares could be affected or any foreign tax\ncredits or deductions passed through to\nshareholders in respect of the Fund's foreign\ntaxes for the current year could be reduced.\nReal Estate Investments. Non-U.S. persons are\ngenerally subject to U.S. tax on a disposition\nof a \u201cUnited States real property interest\u201d (a\n\u201cUSRPI\u201d). Gain on such a disposition is\ngenerally referred to as \u201cFIRPTA gain.\u201d The\nCode provides a look-through rule for\ndistributions of so-called FIRPTA gain by a\nFund if certain requirements are met. If the\nlook-through rule applies, certain\ndistributions attributable to income received\nby a Fund, e.g., from U.S. REITs, may be\ntreated as gain from the disposition of a\nUSRPI, causing distributions to be subject to\nU.S. withholding tax at rates of up to 21%,\nand requiring non-U.S. investors to file\nnonresident U.S. income tax returns. Also,\ngain may be subject to a 30% branch profits\ntax in the hands of a foreign stockholder that\nis treated as a corporation for federal income\ntax purposes. Under certain circumstances,\nShares may qualify as USRPIs, which could\nresult in 15% withholding on certain\ndistributions and gross redemption proceeds\npaid to certain non-U.S. shareholders. For tax\nyears beginning after December 31, 2017 and\nbefore January 1, 2026, a noncorporate\ntaxpayer is generally eligible for a deduction\nof up to 20% of the taxpayer's \u201cqualified REIT\ndividends.\u201d If a Fund receives dividends\n(other than capital gain dividends) in respect\nof U.S. REIT shares, the Fund may report its\nown dividends as eligible for the 20%\ndeduction, to the extent the Fund's income is\nderived from such qualified REIT dividends, as\nreduced by allocable Fund expenses. In order\nfor a Fund's dividends to be eligible for this\ndeduction when received by a noncorporate\nshareholder, the Fund must meet certain\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe U.S. REIT shares on which the Fund\nreceived the eligible dividends, and the\nnoncorporate shareholder must meet certain\nholding period requirements with respect to\nthe Fund Shares. Taxes on Exchange-Listed\nShare Sales. Any capital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund Shares is generally\ntreated as long-term capital gain or loss if\nFund Shares have been held for more than one\nyear and as short-term capital gain or loss if\nFund Shares have been held for one year or\nless, except that any capital loss on the sale\nof Fund 323 Table of Contents Shares held for\nsix months or less will be disallowed to the\nextent of exempt-interest dividends received\nwith respect to those Fund Shares, and to the\nextent not disallowed will be treated as long-\nterm capital loss to the extent that capital\ngain dividends were paid with respect to such\nFund Shares. Taxes on Creations and\nRedemptions of Creation Units. A person who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units\ngenerally will recognize a gain or loss. The\ngain or loss will be equal to the difference\nbetween the market value of the Creation Units\nat the time and the exchanger's aggregate\nbasis in the securities surrendered plus any\ncash paid for the Creation Units. A person who\nexchanges Creation Units for securities will\ngenerally recognize a gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the exchanger's basis\nin the Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss\nrealized upon an exchange of securities for\nCreation Units cannot be deducted currently\nunder the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on\nthe basis that there has been no significant\nchange in economic position. Persons\nexchanging securities should consult their own\ntax advisor with respect to whether wash sale\nrules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. Under current federal tax laws,\nany capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for\nmore than one year and as a short-term capital\ngain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for one\nyear or less. If you create or redeem Creation\nUnits, you will be sent a confirmation\nstatement showing how many Fund Shares you\npurchased or sold and at what price. The Trust\non behalf of each Fund has the right to reject\nan order for Creation Units if the purchaser\n(or a group of purchasers) would, upon\nobtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80%\nor more of the outstanding shares of the\napplicable Fund and if, pursuant to Section\n351 of the Code, the applicable Fund would\nhave a basis in the securities different from\nthe market value of the securities on the date\nof deposit. The Trust also has the right to\nrequire information necessary to determine\nbeneficial share ownership for purposes of the\n80% determination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund, the\npurchaser (or group of purchasers) will not\nrecognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If a Fund\nredeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear\nadditional costs and recognize more capital\ngains than it would if it redeems Creation\nUnits in-kind. Certain Tax-Exempt Investors. A\nFund, if investing in certain limited real\nestate investments and other publicly traded\npartnerships, may be required to pass through\ncertain \u201cexcess inclusion income\u201d and other\nincome as \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d\n(\u201cUBTI\u201d). Prior to investing in a Fund, tax-\nexempt investors sensitive to UBTI should\nconsult their tax advisors regarding this\nissue and IRS pronouncements addressing the\ntreatment of such income in the hands of such\ninvestors. Investments In Certain Foreign\nCorporations. A Fund may invest in foreign\nentities classified as passive foreign\ninvestment companies or \u201cPFICs\u201d or controlled\nforeign corporations or \u201cCFCs\u201d under the Code.\nPFIC and CFC investments are subject to\ncomplex rules that may under certain\ncircumstances adversely affect a Fund.\nAccordingly, investors should consult their\nown tax advisors and carefully consider the\ntax consequences of PFIC and CFC investments\nby a Fund before making an investment in such\nFund. Fund dividends attributable to dividends\nreceived from PFICs generally will not be\ntreated as qualified dividend income.\nAdditional information pertaining to the\npotential tax consequences to the Funds, and\nto the shareholders, from the Funds' potential\ninvestment in PFICs and CFCs can be found in\nthe SAI. Non-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income\ndividends paid by a Fund to shareholders who\nare non-resident aliens or foreign entities\nwill generally be subject to a 30% U.S.\nwithholding tax (other than distributions\nreported by the Fund as interest-related\ndividends and short-term capital gain\ndividends), unless a lower treaty rate applies\nor unless such income is effectively connected\nwith a U.S. trade or business. In general, a\nFund may report interest-related dividends to\nthe extent of its net income derived from\nU.S.-source interest, and a Fund may report\nshort-term capital gain dividends to the\nextent its net short-term capital gain for the\ntaxable year exceeds its net long-term capital\nloss. Gains on the sale of Fund Shares and\ndividends that are, in each case, effectively\nconnected with the conduct of a trade or 324\nTable of Contents business within the U.S.\nwill generally be subject to U.S. federal net\nincome taxation at regular income tax rates.\nNon-U.S. shareholders that own, directly or\nindirectly, more than 5% of a Fund's shares\nare urged to consult their own tax advisors\nconcerning special tax rules that may apply to\ntheir investment. Unless certain non-U.S.\nentities that hold Fund Shares comply with IRS\nrequirements that will generally require them\nto report information regarding U.S. persons\ninvesting in, or holding accounts with, such\nentities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to\ndistributions payable to such entities. A\nnon-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the\nwithholding described in this paragraph under\nan applicable intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the\napplicable foreign government comply with the\nterms of such agreement.

The\nbackup withholding rate is currently 24%.\nBackup withholding will not be applied to\npayments that have been subject to the 30%\nwithholding tax on shareholders who are\nneither citizens nor permanent residents of\nthe United States. Other Tax Issues. A Fund\nmay be subject to tax in certain states where\nthe Fund does business (or is treated as doing\nbusiness as a result of its investments).\nFurthermore, in those states which have income\ntax laws, the tax treatment of the Funds and\nof Fund shareholders with respect to\ndistributions by the Funds may differ from\nfederal tax treatment. The foregoing\ndiscussion summarizes some of the consequences\nunder current federal income tax law of an\ninvestment in the Funds. It is not a\nsubstitute for personal tax advice. Consult\nyour personal tax advisor about the potential\ntax consequences of an investment in the Funds\nunder all applicable tax laws.

     \n  (c)  Amount is less than $0.005 per share.  \n       Total return is calculated assuming a  \n       purchase of shares at net asset value  \n       on the first day and a sale at net     \n       asset value on the last day of each    \n       period reported.

Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized.

because of the timing of sales  \n       and repurchases of Fund shares in      \n       relation to fluctuating market values  \n       for the Fund.                          \n  (c)  Amount is less

day of each    \n       period reported. Distributions are     \n       assumed, for the purpose of this       \n  (d)  calculation, to be reinvested at net   \n       asset value per share on the           \n       respective payment dates of each       \n       distribution.

Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized. Broker commission charges  \n       are not included in this calculation.  \n       Reflects a non-recurring litigation    \n       payment received by the Fund from      \n       State Street Corp., an affiliate,      \n       which amounted to less than $0.005     \n  (f)  per share outstanding as of March 20,  \n       2017. This payment resulted in an      \n       increase to total return of less than  \n       0.005% for the period ended June 30,   \n       2017.                                  \n       Portfolio

Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized.

Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized.

Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized.

Total returns for        \n       periods of less than one year are not  \n       annualized.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $12        $39     $68     $154  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. From the Fund's commencement of\noperations on November 9, 2020 to the most\nrecent fiscal year end, the Fund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 16% of the average value of\nits portfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance\nof the Bloomberg SASB \u00aeUS Corporate ESG Ex-\nControversies Select Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all\nof the securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the\nFund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under normal market conditions, the\nFund generally invests substantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index or in\nsecurities that the Adviser determines have\neconomic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic\ncharacteristics of the securities that\ncomprise the Index. In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents or money market instruments,\nsuch as repurchase agreements and money market\nfunds (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser). In seeking to track the Index,\nthe Fund's assets may be concentrated in an\nindustry or group of industries, but only to\nthe extent the Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nThe Fund may use derivatives, including credit\ndefault swaps and credit default index swaps,\nto obtain investment exposure that the Adviser\nexpects to correlate closely with the Index,\nor a portion of the Index, and in managing\ncash flows. The Index is designed to measure\nthe performance of investment grade corporate\nbonds issued by companies that exhibit certain\nenvironmental, social and governance\ncharacteristics, while also exhibiting risk\nand return characteristics that are comparable\nto those of the Bloomberg US Corporate Index\n(the \u201cParent Index\u201d). The Parent Index\nrepresents publicly issued, investment grade,\nfixed-rate, taxable, U.S. dollar-denominated\ncorporate bonds issued by U.S. and non-U.S.\nindustrial, utility, and financial\ninstitutions that have a remaining maturity of\ngreater than or equal to 1 year and have $300\nmillion or more of par amount outstanding. The\nIndex incorporates ESG criteria to screen\nsecurities within the Parent Index for which\ndata is available (as discussed further\nbelow), and assign scores to the remaining\nsecurities. The scoring system that is\nutilized by the Index, the \u201cResponsibility\u201d or\n\u201cR-Factor TM\u201d score, was developed by State\nStreet Global Advisors. The R-Factor TMscore\nmeasures the performance of a company's\nbusiness operations and governance as related\nto financially material ESG challenges facing\nthe issuer's industry. The R-Factor TMscore\ndraws on a number of data sources that provide\ndata metrics on a variety of ESG topics. The\nR-Factor TMscoring process comprises two\nunderlying components, an ESG component and a\ncorporate governance component. The ESG\ncomponent is based on the framework published\nby the Sustainability Accounting Standards\nBoard (\u201cSASB\u201d), which attempts to identify ESG\nissues that are financially material to an\nissuer based on its industry classification.\nThe ESG component of the R-Factor TMscore is\ndetermined using only those metrics from data\nsources that specifically address such issues.\nThe corporate governance component of the\nscore is generated using region-specific\ncorporate governance codes developed by\ninvestors or regulators that describe minimum\ncorporate governance expectations of a\nparticular region. The governance codes\ntypically address topics such as shareholder\nrights, board independence and executive\ncompensation. The corporate governance\ncomponent uses data provided by data sources\nto assign a corporate governance score\naccording to these governance codes. To\nconstruct the Index, the Parent Index is first\nscreened to remove securities of issuers\ninvolved in, and/or which derive significant\nrevenue (as determined by the Index Provider\n(as defined below)) from, certain practices,\nindustries or product lines, including:\nExtreme Event Controversies, Controversial\nWeapons, UN Global Compact Violations,\nCivilian Firearms, Thermal Coal Extraction and\nTobacco (collectively, Controversial\nCategories). The Index Provider incorporates\ndata drawn from a number of sources for\napplying the screen; however, this data may\nnot be available for certain issuers of\nsecurities in the Parent Index. The remaining\nsecurities are then further screened to remove\nall companies without an R-Factor TM score.\nAll remaining securities, including securities\nof issuers for which Controversial Categories\ndata is not available, are considered the\ninvestable universe. The final portfolio of\nsecurities in the Index is then constructed\nutilizing an optimizer that deploys a\nquantitative process to select constituents\nand their weights to maximize the Index's\noverall R-Factor TM score while minimizing\nactive total risk versus the Parent Index. As\nof July 31, 2021, a significant portion of the\nFund comprised companies in the financial and\nindustrial sectors, although this may change\nfrom time to time. As of July 31, 2021, the\nIndex comprised 3,283 securities. The Index is\nrebalanced on the last business day of each\nmonth. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d),\nwhich is not affiliated with the Fund or the\nAdviser. The Index Provider determines the\ncomposition of the Index, relative weightings\nof the securities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the\nFund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund\nShares will change in value, and you could\nlose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely affect global\neconomies and markets. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts of terrorism,\nthe spread of infectious illness or other\npublic health issues, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. 2 Table of Contents Debt\nSecurities Risk: The values of debt securities\nmay increase or decrease as a result of the\nfollowing: market fluctuations, changes in\ninterest rates, actual or perceived inability\nor unwillingness of issuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to make scheduled\nprincipal or interest payments or illiquidity\nin debt securities markets; the risk of low\nrates of return due to reinvestment of\nsecurities during periods of falling interest\nrates or repayment by issuers with higher\ncoupon or interest rates; and/or the risk of\nlow income due to falling interest rates. To\nthe extent that interest rates rise, certain\nunderlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally\nanticipated and the value of those securities\nmay fall sharply. A rising interest rate\nenvironment may cause the value of the Fund's\nfixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, the\nFund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have\na negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). If the principal on a\ndebt obligation is prepaid before expected,\nthe prepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by the\nFund may decline. Changes in interest rates\nwill likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities\ncould trail the returns on other investment\noptions, including investments in equity\nsecurities. ESG Investing Risk: The Index's\nincorporation of ESG considerations in its\nmethodology may cause the Fund to make\ndifferent investments than funds that do not\nincorporate such considerations in their\nstrategy or investment processes. Under\ncertain economic conditions, this could cause\nthe Fund's investment performance to be worse\nthan funds that do not incorporate such\nconsiderations. The Index's incorporation of\nESG considerations may affect the Fund's\nexposure to certain sectors and/or types of\ninvestments, and may adversely impact the\nFund's performance depending on whether such\nsectors or investments are in or out of favor\nin the market. The Index methodology\nincorporates data and scores provided by third\nparties, which may be unavailable or limited\nfor certain issuers and/or only take into\naccount one or a few of many ESG related\ncomponents of portfolio companies. In\ninstances where data or scores are unavailable\nor limited, the Index may include, and the\nFund may therefore hold, securities of\ncompanies that otherwise would not be included\nor held if data or scores were available or\nmore complete. In addition, ESG information\nand scores across third party data providers,\nindexes and other funds may differ and/or be\nincomparable. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value,\nShare Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the secondary market at\nmarket prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be subject to credit risk\nwith respect to the counterparties with which\nthe Fund enters into derivatives contracts,\nrepurchase agreements, reverse repurchase\nagreements, and other transactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund may be unable to\nterminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, or to recover\ncollateral posted to the counterparty,\nresulting in a loss to the Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral posted by its counterparty,\nit may be delayed or prevented from realizing\non the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Derivatives Risk: Derivative\ntransactions can create investment leverage\nand may have significant volatility. It is\npossible that a derivative transaction will\nresult in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may\nnot be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price. The\ncounterparty to a derivatives contract may be\nunable or unwilling to make timely settlement\npayments, return the Fund's margin, or\notherwise honor its obligations. A derivatives\ntransaction may not behave in the manner\nanticipated by the Adviser or may not have the\neffect on the Fund anticipated by the Adviser.\nFinancial Sector Risk: Financial services\ncompanies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation which may limit both\nthe amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may\ncause an unusually high degree of volatility\nin the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, take action to\nraise capital (such as the issuance of debt or\nequity securities), or cease operations.\nCredit losses resulting from financial\ndifficulties of borrowers and financial losses\nassociated with investment activities can\nnegatively impact the sector. Insurance\ncompanies may be subject to severe price\ncompetition. Adverse economic, business or\npolitical developments could adversely affect\nfinancial institutions engaged in mortgage\nfinance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate. 3 Table of Contents\nIncome Risk: The Fund's income may decline due\nto falling interest rates or other factors.\nIssuers of securities held by the Fund may\ncall or redeem the securities during periods\nof falling interest rates, and the Fund would\nlikely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation\nheld by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have\nto reinvest the prepayment in other\nobligations paying income at lower rates.\nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance\nof an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed\nusing an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will\naffect the performance, volatility, and risk\nof the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nWhen there are changes made to the component\nsecurities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities\nholdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its\nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income\ntax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance of the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's return may not match the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, generally as a result\nof cash flows into or out of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held by the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track\nthe Index return by investing in fewer than\nall of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index,\npotentially increasing the risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's return and that of the\nIndex. Industrial Sector Risk: Industrial\ncompanies are affected by supply and demand\nboth for their specific product or service and\nfor industrial sector products in general.\nGovernment regulation, world events, exchange\nrates and economic conditions, technological\ndevelopments and liabilities for environmental\ndamage and general civil liabilities will\nlikewise affect the performance of these\ncompanies. Aerospace and defense companies, a\ncomponent of the industrial sector, can be\nsignificantly affected by government spending\npolicies because companies involved in this\nindustry rely, to a significant extent, on\nU.S. and foreign government demand for their\nproducts and services. Thus, the financial\ncondition of, and investor interest in,\naerospace and defense companies are heavily\ninfluenced by governmental defense spending\npolicies which are typically under pressure\nfrom efforts to control the U.S. (and other)\ngovernment budgets. Transportation securities,\na component of the industrial sector, are\ncyclical and have occasional sharp price\nmovements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Limited Track Record Risk:\nThe Fund has a limited track record and there\nis no assurance that the Fund will grow\nquickly. When the Fund's size is small, the\nFund may experience low trading volume, which\ncould lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, the Fund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if the Fund does not meet certain\nconditions of the listing exchange. Any\nresulting liquidation of the Fund could cause\nelevated transaction costs for the Fund and\nnegative tax consequences for its\nshareholders. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready\nmarket, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. Non-Diversification Risk: As a\n\u201cnon-diversified\u201d fund, the Fund may hold a\nsmaller number of portfolio securities than\nmany other funds. To the extent the Fund\ninvests in a relatively small number of\nissuers, a decline in the market value of a\nparticular security held by the Fund may\naffect its value more than if it invested in a\nlarger number of issuers. The value of Fund\nShares may be more volatile than the values of\nshares of more diversified funds. The Fund may\nbecome diversified for periods of time solely\nas a result of tracking the Index (e.g.,\nchanges in weightings of one or more component\nsecurities). Non-U.S. Securities Risk:\nNon-U.S. securities (including depositary\nreceipts) are subject to political,\nregulatory, and economic risks not present in\ndomestic investments. There may be less\ninformation publicly available about a\nnon-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and\nmany non-U.S. entities are not subject to\naccounting, auditing, legal and financial\nreport standards comparable to those in the\nUnited States. Further, such entities and/or\ntheir securities may be subject to risks\nassociated with currency controls;\nexpropriation; changes in tax policy; greater\n4 Table of Contents market volatility;\ndiffering securities market structures; higher\ntransaction costs; and various administrative\ndifficulties, such as delays in clearing and\nsettling portfolio transactions or in\nreceiving payment of dividends. To the extent\nunderlying securities held by the Fund trade\non foreign exchanges that are closed when the\nexchange on which the Fund's shares trade is\nopen, there may be deviations between the\ncurrent price of an underlying security and\nthe last quoted price for the underlying\nsecurity on the closed foreign market. These\ndeviations could result in the Fund\nexperiencing premiums or discounts greater\nthan those of ETFs that invest in domestic\nsecurities. Securities traded on foreign\nmarkets may be less liquid (harder to sell)\nthan securities traded domestically. Foreign\ngovernments may impose restrictions on the\nrepatriation of capital to the U.S. In\naddition, to the extent that the Fund buys\nsecurities denominated in a foreign currency,\nthere are special risks such as changes in\ncurrency exchange rates and the risk that a\nforeign government could regulate foreign\nexchange transactions. In addition, to the\nextent investments are made in a limited\nnumber of countries, events in those countries\nwill have a more significant impact on the\nFund. Certain countries have recently\nexperienced (or currently are expected to\nexperience) negative interest rates on certain\nfixed-income securities, and similar interest\nrate conditions may be experienced in other\nregions. Investments in fixed-income\nsecurities with very low or negative interest\nrates may magnify the Fund's susceptibility to\ninterest rate risk and diminish yield and\nperformance, and such investments may be\nsubject to heightened volatility and reduced\nliquidity. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the\nFund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market\nquotations. This may occur more often in times\nof market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There\nare multiple methods that can be used to value\na portfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. In addition, there is no assurance that\nthe Fund could sell or close out a portfolio\nposition for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund\nwould incur a loss because a portfolio\nposition is sold or closed out at a discount\nto the valuation established by the Fund at\nthat time. Fund Performance The Fund has not\nyet completed a full calendar year of\noperations and therefore does not report its\nperformance history.Once the Fund has\ncompleted a full calendar year of operations,\na bar chart and table will be included that\nwill provide some indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing the\nvariability of the Fund's returns based on net\nassets and comparing the Fund's performance to\nthe Index.

Portfolio\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to the Fund.\nPortfolio Managers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Christopher DiStefano, Frank\nMiethe and Michael Brunell. Christopher\nDiStefano is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income\nBeta Solutions Group. He joined the Adviser in\n2010. Frank Miethe, CFA, is a Vice President\nof the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the\nFixed Income Beta Solutions Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 2010.

Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. 5 Table of Contents\nIndividual Fund Shares may only be purchased\nand sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other\nnational securities exchanges, electronic\ncrossing networks and other alternative\ntrading systems through your broker-dealer at\nmarket prices. Because Fund Shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV\n(discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares\nin the secondary market, you may incur costs\nattributable to the difference between the\nhighest price a buyer is willing to pay to\npurchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest\nprice a seller is willing to accept for Fund\nShares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d). Recent\ninformation regarding the Fund's NAV, market\nprice, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask\nspreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains,\nunless you are investing through a tax-\nadvantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan\nor individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from such tax-advantaged\narrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other Financial\nIntermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares\nthrough a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or\nits affiliates may pay the financial\nintermediary for certain activities related to\nthe Fund, including educational training\nprograms, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or\nother services related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These payments may\ncreate a conflict of interest by influencing\nthe broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over\nanother investment.

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $10        $32     $56     $128  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction\ncosts, such as commissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its\nportfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate\nmay indicate higher transaction costs and may\nresult in higher taxes when Fund Shares are\nheld in a taxable account. These costs, which\nare not reflected in Annual Fund Operating\nExpenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's\nperformance. From the Fund's commencement of\noperations on July 28, 2020 to the most recent\nfiscal year end, the Fund's portfolio turnover\nrate was 16% of the average value of its\nportfolio. The Fund's Principal Investment\nStrategy In seeking to track the performance\nof the S&P 500 ESG Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the\nFund employs a sampling strategy, which means\nthat the Fund is not required to purchase all\nof the securities represented in the Index.\nInstead, the Fund may purchase a subset of the\nsecurities in the Index in an effort to hold a\nportfolio of securities with generally the\nsame risk and return characteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of holdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a number of factors,\nincluding asset size of the Fund. Based on its\nanalysis of these factors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d),\nthe investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's assets in a subset of\nsecurities in the Index or may invest the\nFund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in\napproximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in\nthe best interest of the Fund in pursuing its\nobjective. The Fund is classified as\n\u201cdiversified\u201d under the Investment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended; however, the Fund may\nbecome \u201cnon-diversified\u201d solely as a result of\ntracking the Index (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or more component\nsecurities). When the Fund is non-diversified,\nit may invest a relatively high percentage of\nits assets in a limited number of issuers.\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests substantially all, but at\nleast 80%, of its total assets in the\nsecurities comprising the Index. In addition,\nin seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not\nincluded in the Index, cash and cash\nequivalents or money market instruments, such\nas repurchase agreements and money market\nfunds (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser). In seeking to track the\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIndex, the Fund's assets may be concentrated\nin an industry or group of industries, but\nonly to the extent that the Index concentrates\nin a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of\nderivative instrument) may be used by the Fund\nin seeking performance that corresponds to the\nIndex and in managing cash flows. The Index is\ndesigned to measure the performance of\nsecurities meeting certain sustainability\ncriteria (criteria related to ESG factors),\nwhile maintaining similar overall industry\ngroup weights as the S&P 500 Index. Securities\neligible for inclusion in the Index comprise\nall constituents of the S&P 500 Index except\nfor companies that:\n                                              \n     Have involvement with tobacco-related    \n     products and services, based on certain  \n     levels of production or revenue, or      \n  \u2022  hold certain ownership stakes in a       \n     company involved in these products and   \n     services, as determined by               \n     Sustainalytics;                          \n     Are involved in controversial weapons,   \n     including cluster weapons, landmines,    \n     biological or chemical weapons,          \n  \u2022  depleted uranium weapons, white          \n     phosphorus weapons, or nuclear weapons,  \n     or hold certain ownership stakes in a    \n     company involved in these activities,    \n     as determined by Sustainalytics;         \n     Have a United Nations Global Compact     \n  \u2022  (\u201cUNGC\u201d) score in the bottom 5% of all   \n     UNGC-scored companies globally, as       \n     determined by Arabesque;                 \n     Have an S&P DJI ESG Score, as assigned   \n     by SAM, that falls within the worst 25%  \n     from each Global Industry                \n  \u2022  Classification Standard (GICS) industry  \n     group among the combined constituents    \n     of the S&P Global LargeMidCap Index and  \n     the S&P Global 1200 Index;               \n     Generate greater than 5% of their        \n  \u2022  revenue from thermal coal extraction or  \n     electricity generation, as determined    \n     by Sustainalytics; or                    \n     Do not have (i) Sustainalytics coverage  \n     for tobacco-, controversial weapons-     \n  \u2022  and thermal coal-related involvement;    \n     (ii) a UNGC score determined by          \n     Arabesque; or (iii) an S&P DJI ESG       \n     Score.                                   \n                                              \nUNGC scores provided by Arabesque implement\nquantitative models and data to arrive at a\ncompany score based on the normative\nprinciples of the UNGC: human rights, labor\nrights, the environment, and anti-corruption.\nS&P DJI ESG Scores are assigned by SAM, an ESG\nscoring business unit of S&P Global Inc. (an\naffiliate of the Index Provider (defined\nbelow)), using its Corporate Sustainability\nAssessment, which is an annual evaluation of a\ncompany, based on ESG factors that SAM\ndetermines are financially material to the\ncompany, relative to its industry peer\ncompanies as determined by SAM. After\nimplementing the exclusion criteria described\nabove, the remaining companies are then ranked\nbased on their S&P DJI ESG Score. For each\nGICS industry group, companies are selected\nfor inclusion in the Index primarily in\ndecreasing order of S&P DJI ESG Score until\napproximately 75% of the float adjusted market\ncapitalization of the industry group is\nreached. The Index is float-adjusted market\ncapitalization weighted. The Index is\nreconstituted and rebalanced annually on the\nlast business day in April. In addition,\nbetween Index rebalances, Index constituents\nmay be removed from the Index for their\ninvolvement in economic crime and corruption,\nfraud, illegal commercial practices, human\nrights abuses, labor disputes, workplace\nsafety catastrophic accidents, environmental\ndisasters, and certain other activities\nassociated with environmental, social and\ngovernance risks. Any companies removed from\nthe Index on account of such activities are\nnot eligible for inclusion in the Index until\none full calendar year from the next\nrebalancing of the Index. As of July 31, 2021,\na significant portion of the Fund comprised\ncompanies in the technology sector, although\nthis may change from time to time. As of July\n31, 2021, the Index comprised 314 stocks. The\nIndex is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices\nLLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d), which is not\naffiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of\nthe Index, relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index and publishes\ninformation regarding the market value of the\nIndex. Principal Risks of Investing in the\nFund As with all investments, there are\ncertain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund\nShares will change in value, and you could\nlose money by investing in the Fund. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other government agency.\nMarket Risk: The Fund's investments are\nsubject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in the actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The Fund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical events will disrupt\nsecurities markets and adversely\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents affect global economies and\nmarkets. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its\ninvestments. Equity Investing Risk: The market\nprices of equity securities owned by the Fund\nmay go up or down, sometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The value of a security may\ndecline for a number of reasons that may\ndirectly relate to the issuer and also may\ndecline due to general industry or market\nconditions that are not specifically related\nto a particular company. In addition, equity\nmarkets tend to move in cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to fall over short or\nextended periods of time. ESG Investing Risk:\nThe Index's incorporation of ESG\nconsiderations in its methodology may cause\nthe Fund to make different investments than\nfunds that do not incorporate such\nconsiderations in their strategy or investment\nprocesses. Under certain economic conditions,\nthis could cause the Fund's investment\nperformance to be worse than funds that do not\nincorporate such considerations. The Index's\nincorporation of ESG considerations may affect\nthe Fund's exposure to certain sectors and/or\ntypes of investments, and may adversely impact\nthe Fund's performance depending on whether\nsuch sectors or investments are in or out of\nfavor in the market. Large-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk: Returns on investments in\nsecurities of large companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of\nsmaller and mid-sized companies. Larger\ncompanies may be unable to respond as quickly\nas smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in\nbusiness, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able\nto maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-\nsized companies. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As\nwith all exchange-traded funds, Fund Shares\nmay be bought and sold in the secondary market\nat market prices. The trading prices of Fund\nShares in the secondary market may differ from\nthe Fund's daily net asset value per share and\nthere may be times when the market price of\nthe shares is more than the net asset value\nper share (premium) or less than the net asset\nvalue per share (discount). This risk is\nheightened in times of market volatility or\nperiods of steep market declines. Counterparty\nRisk: The Fund will be subject to credit risk\nwith respect to the counterparties with which\nthe Fund enters into derivatives contracts,\nrepurchase agreements, reverse repurchase\nagreements, and other transactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund may be unable to\nterminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, or to recover\ncollateral posted to the counterparty,\nresulting in a loss to the Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral posted by its counterparty,\nit may be delayed or prevented from realizing\non the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Derivatives Risk: Derivative\ntransactions can create investment leverage\nand may have significant volatility. It is\npossible that a derivative transaction will\nresult in a much greater loss than the\nprincipal amount invested, and the Fund may\nnot be able to close out a derivative\ntransaction at a favorable time or price. The\ncounterparty to a derivatives contract may be\nunable or unwilling to make timely settlement\npayments, return the Fund's margin, or\notherwise honor its obligations. A derivatives\ntransaction may not behave in the manner\nanticipated by the Adviser or may not have the\neffect on the Fund anticipated by the Adviser.\nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance\nof an unmanaged index of securities,\nregardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's performance may be less\nfavorable than that of a portfolio managed\nusing an active investment strategy. The\nstructure and composition of the Index will\naffect the performance, volatility, and risk\nof the Index and, consequently, the\nperformance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.\nWhen there are changes made to the component\nsecurities of the Index and the Fund in turn\nmakes similar changes to its portfolio, any\ntransaction costs and market exposure arising\nfrom such portfolio changes will be borne\ndirectly by the Fund and its shareholders. The\nFund may recognize gains as a result of\nrebalancing or reconstituting its securities\nholdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its\nshareholders to avoid adverse federal income\ntax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to\ntrack the performance of the Index ( i.e. ,\nachieve a high degree of correlation with the\nIndex), the Fund's return may not match the\nreturn of the Index. The Fund incurs a number\nof operating expenses not applicable to the\nIndex, and incurs costs in buying and selling\nsecurities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, generally as a result\nof cash flows into or out of the Fund or\nreserves of cash held by the Fund to meet\nredemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track\nthe Index return by investing in fewer than\nall of the securities in the Index, or in some\nsecurities not included in the Index,\npotentially increasing the risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's return and that of the\nIndex. 9 Table of Contents Limited Track\nRecord Risk: The Fund has a limited track\nrecord and there is no assurance that the Fund\nwill grow quickly. When the Fund's size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading\nvolume, which could lead to wider bid/ask\nspreads. In addition, the Fund may face the\nrisk of being delisted if the Fund does not\nmeet certain conditions of the listing\nexchange. Any resulting liquidation of the\nFund could cause elevated transaction costs\nfor the Fund and negative tax consequences for\nits shareholders. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a\nready market, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a security at an\nadvantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid\ninvestments may trade at a discount from\ncomparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value.\nIf the liquidity of the Fund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may lead to differences\nbetween the market price of Fund Shares and\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, and could\nresult in the Fund Shares being less liquid.\nIlliquidity of the Fund's holdings may also\nlimit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash\nto meet redemptions on a timely basis. In\naddition, the Fund, due to limitations on\ninvestments in any illiquid investments and/or\nthe difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its\ndesired level of exposure to a certain market\nor sector. Non-Diversification Risk: To the\nextent the Fund becomes \u201cnon-diversified,\u201d the\nFund may hold a smaller number of portfolio\nsecurities than many other funds. To the\nextent the Fund invests in a relatively small\nnumber of issuers, a decline in the market\nvalue of a particular security held by the\nFund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. The Fund may become non-diversified for\nperiods of time solely as a result of tracking\nthe Index (e.g., changes in weightings of one\nor more component securities). Technology\nSector Risk: Market or economic factors\nimpacting technology companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technological advances\ncould have a major effect on the value of the\nFund's investments. The value of stocks of\ntechnology companies and companies that rely\nheavily on technology is particularly\nvulnerable to rapid changes in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid product obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation and competition, both\ndomestically and internationally, including\ncompetition from foreign competitors with\nlower production costs. Stocks of technology\ncompanies and companies that rely heavily on\ntechnology, especially those of smaller, less-\nseasoned companies, tend to be more volatile\nthan the overall market. Technology companies\nare heavily dependent on patent and\nintellectual property rights, the loss or\nimpairment of which may adversely affect\nprofitability. Additionally, companies in the\ntechnology sector may face dramatic and often\nunpredictable changes in growth rates and\ncompetition for the services of qualified\npersonnel. Unconstrained Sector Risk: The Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets\nwithin one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to\ntime. Greater investment focus on one or more\nsectors or industries increases the potential\nfor volatility and the risk that events\nnegatively affecting such sectors or\nindustries could reduce returns, potentially\ncausing the value of the Fund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps significantly. Fund\nPerformance The Fund has not yet completed a\nfull calendar year of operations and therefore\ndoes not report its performance history.Once\nthe Fund has completed a full calendar year of\noperations, a bar chart and table will be\nincluded that will provide some indication of\nthe risks of investing in the Fund by showing\nthe variability of the Fund's returns based on\nnet assets and comparing the Fund's\nperformance to the Index.

Portfolio\nManagement Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves\nas the investment adviser to the Fund.\nPortfolio Managers The professionals primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nthe Fund are Emiliano Rabinovich, Karl\nSchneider and Olga Winner. Emiliano\nRabinovich, CFA, is a Managing Director of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions Group. He joined\nthe Adviser in 2006. Karl Schneider, CAIA, is\na Managing Director of the Adviser and Deputy\nHead of Global Equity Beta Solutions in the\nAmericas.

She joined the Adviser in\n2007. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund\nwill issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to certain\ninstitutional investors (typically market\nmakers or other broker-dealers) only in large\nblocks of Fund Shares known as \u201cCreation\nUnits.\u201d Creation Unit transactions are\nconducted in exchange for the deposit or\ndelivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind\nsecurities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares\nmay only be purchased and sold on the NYSE\nArca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSPDR \u00aeSSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF\n                                              \n  Investment Objective                        \n  The SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF    \n  (the                                        \n  \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to provide investment         \n  results that,                               \n  before fees and expenses, correspond        \n  generally to                                \n  the total return performance of an index    \n  that                                        \n  tracks U.S. companies that are leaders in   \n  advancing women through gender diversity    \n  on their                                    \n  boards of directors and in management.      \n                                              \nFees and Expenses of the Fund The table below\ndescribes the fees and expenses that you may\npay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the\nFund (\u201cFund Shares\u201d).

The\nExample assumes that you invest $10,000 in the\nFund for the time periods indicated, and then\nsell all of your Fund Shares at the end of\nthose periods. The Example also assumes that\nyour investment has a 5% return each year and\nthat the Fund's operating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs may be higher\nor lower, based on these assumptions your\ncosts would be:\n                                   \n  Year 1  Year 3  Year 5  Year 10  \n  $20        $64    $113     $255  \n                                   \nPortfolio Turnover:\nThe Fund pays\ntransaction costs,\nsuch as commissions,\nwhen it buys and sells\nsecurities (or \u201cturns\nover\u201d its portfolio).\nA higher portfolio\nturnover rate may\nindicate higher\ntransaction costs and\nmay result in higher\ntaxes when Fund Shares\nare held in a taxable\naccount. These costs,\nwhich are not\nreflected in Annual\nFund Operating\nExpenses or in the\nExample, affect the\nFund's performance.\nDuring the most recent\nfiscal year, the\nFund's portfolio\nturnover rate was 22%\nof the average value\nof its portfolio. The\nFund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy In\nseeking to track the\nperformance of the\nSSGA Gender Diversity\nIndex (the \u201cIndex\u201d),\nthe Fund employs a\nsampling strategy,\nwhich means that the\nFund is not required\nto purchase all of the\nsecurities represented\nin the Index. Instead,\nthe Fund may purchase\na subset of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex in an effort to\nhold a portfolio of\nsecurities with\ngenerally the same\nrisk and return\ncharacteristics of the\nIndex. The quantity of\nholdings in the Fund\nwill be based on a\nnumber of factors,\nincluding asset size\nof the Fund. Based on\nits analysis of these\nfactors, SSGA Funds\nManagement, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the\n\u201cAdviser\u201d), the\ninvestment adviser to\nthe Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of\nsecurities in the\nIndex or may invest\nthe Fund's assets in\nsubstantially all of\nthe securities\nrepresented in the\nIndex in approximately\nthe same proportions\nas the Index, as\ndetermined by the\nAdviser to be in the\nbest interest of the\nFund in pursuing its\nobjective. Under\nnormal market\nconditions, the Fund\ngenerally invests\nsubstantially all, but\nat least 80%, of its\ntotal assets in the\nsecurities comprising\nthe Index. In\naddition, in seeking\nto track the Index,\nthe Fund may invest in\nequity securities that\nare not included in\nthe Index, cash and\ncash equivalents or\nmoney market\ninstruments, such as\nrepurchase agreements\nand money market funds\n(including money\nmarket funds advised\nby the Adviser). In\nseeking to track the\nIndex, the Fund's\nassets may be\nconcentrated in an\nindustry or group of\nindustries, but only\nto the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in\na particular industry\nor group of\nindustries. Futures\ncontracts (a type of\nderivative instrument)\nmay be used by the\nFund in seeking\nperformance that\ncorresponds to the\nIndex and in managing\ncash flows.\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents The\nIndex is designed to\nmeasure the\nperformance of U.S.\nlarge capitalization\ncompanies that are\n\u201cgender diverse,\u201d\nwhich are defined as\ncompanies that exhibit\ngender diversity in\ntheir senior\nleadership positions\n(as set forth below).\nThe Index constituents\nare a subset of the\nlargest 1,000 U.S.\nstocks based on market\ncapitalization listed\non a U.S. national\nsecurities exchange\nthat have a trailing\nsix-month average\ndaily trading volume\nof at least 250,000\nshares as of the Index\nrebalance\ndetermination date.\nThis subset serves as\nthe initial universe\nof eligible securities\nfor the Index (the\n\u201cIndex Universe\u201d),\nprovided that any\ncompany whose market\ncapitalization\nrepresents greater\nthan 10% of its\nrespective sector's\ntotal market\ncapitalization is not\neligible for inclusion\nin the Index to avoid\noverconcentration in\nany single issuer\nrelative to its\nrespective sector's\nweighting in the\nIndex. In constructing\nthe Index, the Index\nUniverse is ranked by\ngender diversity\nwithin each sector\naccording to ratio-\nbased criteria, as\ndetermined by an\nanalysis by an\nindependent third\nparty of information\nincluded in a\ncompany's regulatory\nfilings, press\nreleases and corporate\nwebsite (\u201ccompany\ncommunications\u201d).\nCompanies are ranked\nwithin each sector by\nthe following three\ngender diversity\nratio-based criteria:\n(i) ratio of female\nexecutives and female\nmembers of the board\nof directors to all\nexecutives and members\nof the board of\ndirectors; (ii) ratio\nof female executives\nto all executives;\n(iii) ratio of female\nexecutives excluding\nexecutives who are\nmembers of the board\nof directors to all\nexecutives excluding\nexecutives who are\nmembers of the board\nof directors.\n\u201cExecutives\u201d comprise\neach employee\ndisclosed in company\ncommunications that\nholds the position of\nVice President and\nabove in the\norganizational\nstructure of such\ncompany, except that\n\u201cexecutives\u201d of\nfinancial sector\ncompanies comprise\neach employee\ndisclosed in company\ncommunications that\nholds the position of\nManaging Director or\nabove in the\norganizational\nstructure of such\ncompany.

For each\nratio-based criteria,\nthe highest ranked\ncompanies within each\nsector whose combined\nsector market\ncapitalization equals\n10%, including the\nfirst company that\nbrings the combined\nsector market\ncapitalization above\n10% (such companies,\nthe \u201cRank Qualifying\nCompanies\u201d), are\neligible for inclusion\nin the Index. For each\nratio-based criteria,\na Rank Qualifying\nCompany included in\nthe Index that, as of\nthe next annual Index\nrebalance\ndetermination date, is\nno longer a Rank\nQualifying Company\nwill remain eligible\nfor inclusion in the\nIndex for one\nadditional rebalance\nperiod so long as the\ncompany's qualifying\nratio has not\ndecreased. The Index\ncomprises companies\nthat are eligible for\ninclusion based on the\nratio-based criteria\nand which have at\nleast one female in\none of the following\npositions in the\ncompany: Chief\nExecutive Officer,\nchairperson, or member\nof the board of\ndirectors, as of the\nmost recent annual\nIndex rebalance\ndetermination date. At\nthe annual Index\nrebalance\ndetermination date,\nconstituents are first\nweighted by free float\nmarket capitalization.\nConstituent weightings\nare then adjusted so\nthat the aggregate\nsector weights in the\nIndex are the same as\nthe aggregate sector\nweights in the Index\nUniverse and so the\nmaximum individual\nsecurity weight in the\nIndex is capped at 5%.\nThe Index rebalances\nannually on July 15 or\non the next business\nday following July 15\nif July 15 is not a\nbusiness day. As of\nJuly 31, 2021, a\nsignificant portion of\nthe Fund comprised\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector,\nalthough this may\nchange from time to\ntime. As of July 31,\n2021, the Index\ncomprised 192\nsecurities. The Index\nwas created and is\nsponsored by State\nStreet Global Advisors\n(the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d\nor \u201cSSGA\u201d), an\naffiliate of the Fund\nand of SSGA FM, the\nFund's Adviser. The\nIndex Provider\nestablishes and\nmaintains rules which\nare used to determine\nthe composition of the\nIndex and relative\nweightings of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex. Principal Risks\nof Investing in the\nFund As with all\ninvestments, there are\ncertain risks of\ninvesting in the Fund.\nFund Shares will\nchange in value, and\nyou could lose money\nby investing in the\nFund. An investment in\nthe Fund is not\ninsured or guaranteed\nby the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation\nor any other\ngovernment agency.\nMarket Risk: The\nFund's investments are\nsubject to changes in\ngeneral economic\nconditions, general\nmarket fluctuations\nand the risks inherent\nin investment in\nsecurities markets.\nInvestment markets can\nbe volatile and prices\nof investments can\nchange substantially\ndue to various factors\nincluding, but not\nlimited to, economic\ngrowth or recession,\nchanges in interest\nrates, changes in the\nactual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of\nissuers, and general\nmarket liquidity. The\nFund is subject to the\nrisk that geopolitical\nevents will disrupt\nsecurities markets and\nadversely affect\nglobal economies and\nmarkets. Local,\nregional or global\nevents such as war,\nacts of terrorism, the\nspread of infectious\nillness or other\npublic health issues,\nor other events could\nhave a significant\nimpact on the Fund and\nits investments.\nEquity Investing Risk:\nThe market prices of\nequity securities\nowned by the Fund may\ngo up or down,\nsometimes rapidly or\nunpredictably. The\nvalue of a security\nmay decline for a\nnumber of reasons that\nmay directly relate to\nthe issuer and also\nmay decline due to\ngeneral industry or\nmarket conditions that\nare not specifically\nrelated to a\nparticular company. In\naddition, equity\nmarkets tend to move\nin cycles, which may\ncause stock prices to\nfall over short or\nextended periods of\ntime. 13 Table of\nContents Gender\nDiversity Risk: The\nreturns on a portfolio\nof securities that\nexcludes companies\nthat are not gender\ndiverse may trail the\nreturns on a portfolio\nof securities that\nincludes companies\nthat are not gender\ndiverse. Investing\nonly in a portfolio of\nsecurities that are\ngender diverse may\naffect the Fund's\nexposure to certain\ntypes of investments\nand may adversely\nimpact the Fund's\nperformance depending\non whether such\ninvestments are in or\nout of favor in the\nmarket. Fluctuation of\nNet Asset Value, Share\nPremiums and Discounts\nRisk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds,\nFund Shares may be\nbought and sold in the\nsecondary market at\nmarket prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund\nShares in the\nsecondary market may\ndiffer from the Fund's\ndaily net asset value\nper share and there\nmay be times when the\nmarket price of the\nshares is more than\nthe net asset value\nper share (premium) or\nless than the net\nasset value per share\n(discount). This risk\nis heightened in times\nof market volatility\nor periods of steep\nmarket declines.\nCounterparty Risk: The\nFund will be subject\nto credit risk with\nrespect to the\ncounterparties with\nwhich the Fund enters\ninto derivatives\ncontracts, repurchase\nagreements, reverse\nrepurchase agreements,\nand other\ntransactions. If a\ncounterparty fails to\nmeet its contractual\nobligations, the Fund\nmay be unable to\nterminate or realize\nany gain on the\ninvestment or\ntransaction, or to\nrecover collateral\nposted to the\ncounterparty,\nresulting in a loss to\nthe Fund. If the Fund\nholds collateral\nposted by its\ncounterparty, it may\nbe delayed or\nprevented from\nrealizing on the\ncollateral in the\nevent of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency\nproceeding relating to\nthe counterparty.\nDerivatives Risk:\nDerivative\ntransactions can\ncreate investment\nleverage and may have\nsignificant\nvolatility. It is\npossible that a\nderivative transaction\nwill result in a much\ngreater loss than the\nprincipal amount\ninvested, and the Fund\nmay not be able to\nclose out a derivative\ntransaction at a\nfavorable time or\nprice. The\ncounterparty to a\nderivatives contract\nmay be unable or\nunwilling to make\ntimely settlement\npayments, return the\nFund's margin, or\notherwise honor its\nobligations. A\nderivatives\ntransaction may not\nbehave in the manner\nanticipated by the\nAdviser or may not\nhave the effect on the\nFund anticipated by\nthe Adviser. Indexing\nStrategy/Index\nTracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with\nan indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting\nto track the\nperformance of an\nunmanaged index of\nsecurities, regardless\nof the current or\nprojected performance\nof the Index or of the\nactual securities\ncomprising the Index.\nThis differs from an\nactively-managed fund,\nwhich typically seeks\nto outperform a\nbenchmark index. As a\nresult, the Fund's\nperformance may be\nless favorable than\nthat of a portfolio\nmanaged using an\nactive investment\nstrategy. The\nstructure and\ncomposition of the\nIndex will affect the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Index and,\nconsequently, the\nperformance,\nvolatility, and risk\nof the Fund. When\nthere are changes made\nto the component\nsecurities of the\nIndex and the Fund in\nturn makes similar\nchanges to its\nportfolio, any\ntransaction costs and\nmarket exposure\narising from such\nportfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by\nthe Fund and its\nshareholders. The Fund\nmay recognize gains as\na result of\nrebalancing or\nreconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to\nreflect changes in the\nsecurities included in\nthe Index. The Fund\nalso may be required\nto distribute any such\ngains to its\nshareholders to avoid\nadverse federal income\ntax consequences.\nWhile the Adviser\nseeks to track the\nperformance of the\nIndex ( i.e. , achieve\na high degree of\ncorrelation with the\nIndex), the Fund's\nreturn may not match\nthe return of the\nIndex. The Fund incurs\na number of operating\nexpenses not\napplicable to the\nIndex, and incurs\ncosts in buying and\nselling securities. In\naddition, the Fund may\nnot be fully invested\nat times, generally as\na result of cash flows\ninto or out of the\nFund or reserves of\ncash held by the Fund\nto meet redemptions.\nThe Adviser may\nattempt to track the\nIndex return by\ninvesting in fewer\nthan all of the\nsecurities in the\nIndex, or in some\nsecurities not\nincluded in the Index,\npotentially increasing\nthe risk of divergence\nbetween the Fund's\nreturn and that of the\nIndex. Large-\nCapitalization\nSecurities Risk:\nReturns on investments\nin securities of large\ncompanies could trail\nthe returns on\ninvestments in\nsecurities of smaller\nand mid-sized\ncompanies. Larger\ncompanies may be\nunable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and\nmid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges\nor to changes in\nbusiness, product,\nfinancial, or other\nmarket conditions.\nLarger companies may\nnot be able to\nmaintain growth at the\nhigh rates that may be\nachieved by well-\nmanaged smaller and\nmid-sized companies.\nLiquidity Risk: Lack\nof a ready market,\nstressed market\nconditions, or\nrestrictions on resale\nmay limit the ability\nof the Fund to sell a\nsecurity at an\nadvantageous time or\nprice or at all.\nIlliquid investments\nmay trade at a\ndiscount from\ncomparable, more\nliquid investments and\nmay be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market\nvalue. If the\nliquidity of the\nFund's holdings\ndeteriorates, it may\nlead to differences\nbetween the market\nprice of Fund Shares\nand the net asset\nvalue of Fund Shares,\nand could result in\nthe Fund Shares being\nless liquid.\nIlliquidity of the\nFund's holdings may\nalso limit the ability\nof the Fund to obtain\ncash to meet\nredemptions on a\ntimely basis. In\naddition, the Fund,\ndue to limitations on\ninvestments in any\nilliquid investments\nand/or the difficulty\nin purchasing and\nselling such\ninvestments, may be\nunable to achieve its\ndesired level of\nexposure to a certain\nmarket or sector. Non-\nDiversification Risk:\nAs a \u201cnon-diversified\u201d\nfund, the Fund may\nhold a smaller number\nof portfolio\nsecurities than many\nother funds. To the\nextent the Fund\ninvests in a\nrelatively small\nnumber of issuers, a\ndecline in the market\nvalue of a particular\nsecurity held by the\nFund may affect its\nvalue more than if it\ninvested in a larger\n14\n\nTable of Contents\nnumber of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares\nmay be more volatile\nthan the values of\nshares of more\ndiversified funds. The\nFund may become\ndiversified for\nperiods of time solely\nas a result of\ntracking the Index\n(e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or\nmore component\nsecurities).\nTechnology Sector\nRisk: Market or\neconomic factors\nimpacting technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on\ntechnological advances\ncould have a major\neffect on the value of\nthe Fund's\ninvestments. The value\nof stocks of\ntechnology companies\nand companies that\nrely heavily on\ntechnology is\nparticularly\nvulnerable to rapid\nchanges in technology\nproduct cycles, rapid\nproduct obsolescence,\ngovernment regulation\nand competition, both\ndomestically and\ninternationally,\nincluding competition\nfrom foreign\ncompetitors with lower\nproduction costs.\nStocks of technology\ncompanies and\ncompanies that rely\nheavily on technology,\nespecially those of\nsmaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be\nmore volatile than the\noverall market.\nTechnology companies\nare heavily dependent\non patent and\nintellectual property\nrights, the loss or\nimpairment of which\nmay adversely affect\nprofitability.\nAdditionally,\ncompanies in the\ntechnology sector may\nface dramatic and\noften unpredictable\nchanges in growth\nrates and competition\nfor the services of\nqualified personnel.\nUnconstrained Sector\nRisk: The Fund may\ninvest a substantial\nportion of its assets\nwithin one or more\neconomic sectors or\nindustries, which may\nchange from time to\ntime. Greater\ninvestment focus on\none or more sectors or\nindustries increases\nthe potential for\nvolatility and the\nrisk that events\nnegatively affecting\nsuch sectors or\nindustries could\nreduce returns,\npotentially causing\nthe value of the\nFund's Shares to\ndecrease, perhaps\nsignificantly.\n\nFund Performance The\nfollowing bar chart\nand table provide an\nindication of the\nrisks of investing in\nthe Fund by showing\nchanges in the Fund's\nperformance from year\nto year and by showing\nhow the Fund's average\nannual returns for\ncertain time periods\ncompare with the\naverage annual returns\nof the Index and of a\nrelevant broad-based\nsecurities index.

Charitable contributions\nfrom the Adviser and certain of its affiliates\nwill be benchmarked to the assets under\nmanagement of the Fund. The charitable\norganization will seek to make donations to\nidentified charitable organizations that\nsupport continuing educational efforts\ndesigned to mitigate gender inequality in\ncorporate America, and will aim to engage with\nother organizations in an effort to increase\nthe amount of philanthropic dollars available\nfor such initiatives. The charitable\norganization will not participate in, or have\nany influence on the day-to-day operations of,\nthe Fund or the Adviser's management of the\nFund. Portfolio Managers The professionals\nprimarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Melissa Kapitulik\nand Amy Cheng. Melissa Kapitulik is a Vice\nPresident of the Adviser and a Senior\nPortfolio Manager in the Global Equity Beta\nSolutions Group. She joined the Adviser in\n2006. Amy Cheng is a Vice President of the\nAdviser and a Senior Portfolio Manager in the\nGlobal Equity Beta Solutions Group. She joined\nthe Adviser in 2000. Purchase and Sale\nInformation The Fund will issue (or redeem)\nFund Shares to certain institutional investors\n(typically market makers or other broker-\ndealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares\nknown as \u201cCreation Units.\u201d Creation Unit\ntransactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio\nof in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual\nFund Shares may only be purchased and sold on\nthe NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities\nexchanges, electronic crossing networks and\nother alternative trading systems through your\nbroker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund\nShares trade at market prices rather than at\nnet asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d), Fund Shares may trade\nat a price greater than NAV (premium) or less\nthan NAV (discount). When buying or selling\nFund Shares in the secondary market, you may\nincur costs attributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer is willing\nto pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing to accept for\nFund Shares (ask) (the \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d).\nRecent information regarding the Fund's NAV,\nmarket price, premiums and discounts, and bid-\nask spreads is available at\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs. Tax Information\nThe Fund's distributions are expected to be\ntaxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend\nincome and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged\narrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or\nindividual retirement account. Any withdrawals\nmade from such tax-advantaged arrangement may\nbe taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers\nand Other Financial Intermediaries If you\npurchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer\nor other financial intermediary (such as a\nbank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay\nthe financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including\neducational training programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology platforms and\nreporting systems, or other services related\nto the sale or promotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of interest by\ninfluencing the broker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson to recommend\nthe Fund over another investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information.\n16 Table of Contents Additional Strategies\nInformation Principal Strategies General .\nPlease see each Fund's \u201cThe Fund's Principal\nInvestment Strategy\u201d section under \u201cFund\nSummaries\u201d above for a complete discussion of\neach Fund's principal investment strategy. A\nFund may invest in various types of securities\nand engage in various investment techniques\nwhich are not the principal focus of the Fund\nand therefore are not described in this\nProspectus. These securities, techniques and\npractices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional\nInformation (the \u201cSAI\u201d), which you may obtain\nfree of charge by contacting shareholder\nservices (see the back cover of this\nProspectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of\neach Fund's Index as closely as possible\n(i.e., obtain a high degree of correlation\nwith the Index). A number of factors may\naffect a Fund's ability to achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with its Index, and\nthere can be no guarantee that a Fund will\nachieve a high degree of correlation. For\nexample, a Fund may not be able to achieve a\nhigh degree of correlation with its Index when\nthere are practical difficulties or\nsubstantial costs involved in compiling a\nportfolio of securities to follow the Index,\nwhen a security in the Index becomes\ntemporarily illiquid, unavailable or less\nliquid, or legal restrictions exist that\nprohibit the Fund from investing in a security\nin the Index. The Adviser will utilize a\nsampling strategy in managing the Funds.\nSampling means that the Adviser uses\nquantitative analysis to select securities,\nincluding securities in the Index, outside of\nthe Index and derivatives that have a similar\ninvestment profile as the relevant Index in\nterms of key risk factors, performance\nattributes and other economic characteristics.\nThese include industry weightings, market\ncapitalization, and other financial\ncharacteristics of securities. The quantity of\nholdings in a Fund will be based on a number\nof factors, including asset size of the Fund.\nIn addition, from time to time, securities are\nadded to or removed from each Index. The\nAdviser may sell securities that are\nrepresented in an Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in an\nIndex, in anticipation of their removal from\nor addition to an Index. Further, the Adviser\nmay choose to overweight securities in an\nIndex, purchase or sell securities not in an\nIndex, or utilize various combinations of\nother available techniques, in seeking to\ntrack an Index. The SPDR Bloomberg SASB\nCorporate Bond ESG Select ETF, as described in\nthe SAI, has adopted a non-fundamental\ninvestment policy to invest at least 80% of\nits net assets, plus the amount of borrowings\nfor investment purposes, in investments\nsuggested by its name, measured at the time of\ninvestment. The SPDR Bloomberg SASB Corporate\nBond ESG Select ETF will provide shareholders\nwith at least 60 days' notice prior to any\nchange in this non-fundamental 80% investment\npolicy. The Board of Trustees of the Trust\n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) may change a Fund's investment\nstrategy, Index and other policies without\nshareholder approval, except as otherwise\nindicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI.\nThe Board may also change a Fund's investment\nobjective without shareholder approval. Non-\nPrincipal Strategies Certain Other Investments\n. Each Fund may invest in structured notes\n(notes on which the amount of principal\nrepayment and interest payments are based on\nthe movement of one or more specified factors\nsuch as the movement of a particular security\nor index), swaps, options and futures\ncontracts. Swaps, options and futures\ncontracts and structured notes may be used by\na Fund in seeking performance that corresponds\nto its Index and in managing cash flows.\nTemporary Defensive Positions . In certain\nsituations or market conditions, a Fund may\ntemporarily depart from its normal investment\npolicies and strategies, provided that the\nalternative is consistent with the Fund's\ninvestment objective and is in the best\ninterest of the Fund. For example, a Fund may\nmake larger than normal investments in\nderivatives to maintain exposure to its Index\nif it is unable to invest directly in a\ncomponent security. Borrowing Money . Each\nFund may borrow money from a bank as permitted\nby the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), or other governing\nstatute, by the Rules thereunder, or by the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) or other regulatory agency with\nauthority over the Fund, but only for\ntemporary or emergency purposes. Each Fund may\nalso invest in reverse repurchase agreements,\nwhich are considered borrowings under the 1940\nAct. Although the 1940 Act presently allows a\nFund to borrow from any bank (including\npledging, mortgaging or 17\n\nTable of Contents hypothecating assets) in an\namount up to 33 1/ 3% of its total assets (not\nincluding temporary borrowings not in excess\nof 5% of its total assets), and there is no\npercentage limit on Fund assets that can be\nused in connection with reverse repurchase\nagreements, under normal circumstances any\nborrowings by a Fund will not exceed 10% of\nthe Fund's total assets. Lending of Securities\n. Each Fund may lend its portfolio securities\nin an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of\nits net assets via a securities lending\nprogram through its securities lending agent,\nState Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState\nStreet\u201d or the \u201cLending Agent\u201d), to brokers,\ndealers and other financial institutions\ndesiring to borrow securities to complete\ntransactions and for other purposes. A\nsecurities lending program allows a Fund to\nreceive a portion of the income generated by\nlending its securities and investing the\nrespective collateral. A Fund will receive\ncollateral for each loaned security which is\nat least equal to the market value of that\nsecurity, marked to market each trading day.\nIn the securities lending program, the\nborrower generally has the right to vote the\nloaned securities; however, a Fund may call\nloans to vote proxies if a material issue\naffecting the Fund's economic interest in the\ninvestment is to be voted upon. Security loans\nmay be terminated at any time by a Fund.\nAdditional Risk Information The following\nsection provides information regarding the\nprincipal risks identified under \u201cPrincipal\nRisks of Investing in the Fund\u201d in each Fund\nSummary along with additional risk\ninformation.

Call/prepayment risk is\nthe risk that an issuer will exercise its\nright to pay principal on an obligation held\nby a Fund earlier than expected or required.\nThis may occur, for example, when there is a\ndecline in interest rates, and an issuer of\nbonds or preferred stock redeems the bonds or\nstock in order to replace them with\nobligations on which it is required to pay a\nlower interest or dividend rate. It may also\noccur when there is an unanticipated increase\nin the rate at which mortgages or other\nreceivables underlying mortgage- or asset-\nbacked securities held by a Fund are prepaid.\nIn any such case, a Fund may be forced to\ninvest the prepaid amounts in lower-yielding\ninvestments, resulting in a decline in the\nFund's income. Counterparty Risk . A Fund will\nbe subject to credit risk with respect to the\ncounterparties with which the Fund enters into\nderivatives contracts and other transactions\nsuch as repurchase agreements or reverse\nrepurchase agreements. A Fund's ability to\nprofit from these types of investments and\ntransactions will depend on the willingness\nand ability of its counterparty to perform its\nobligations. If a counterparty fails to meet\nits contractual obligations, a Fund may be\nunable to terminate or realize any gain on the\ninvestment or transaction, resulting in a loss\nto the Fund. A Fund may experience significant\ndelays in obtaining any recovery in an\ninsolvency, bankruptcy, or other\nreorganization proceeding involving its\ncounterparty (including recovery of any\ncollateral posted by it) and may obtain only a\nlimited 19\n\nTable of Contents recovery or may obtain no\nrecovery in such circumstances. If a Fund\nholds collateral posted by its counterparty,\nit may be delayed or prevented from realizing\non the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy\nor insolvency proceeding relating to the\ncounterparty. Under applicable law or\ncontractual provisions, including if a Fund\nenters into an investment or transaction with\na financial institution and such financial\ninstitution (or an affiliate of the financial\ninstitution) experiences financial\ndifficulties, then the Fund may in certain\nsituations be prevented or delayed from\nexercising its rights to terminate the\ninvestment or transaction, or to realize on\nany collateral and may result in the\nsuspension of payment and delivery obligations\nof the parties under such investment or\ntransactions or in another institution being\nsubstituted for that financial institution\nwithout the consent of the Fund. Further, a\nFund may be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d risk under\napplicable law whereby, if required by the\nfinancial institution's authority, the\nfinancial institution's liabilities could be\nwritten down, eliminated or converted into\nequity or an alternative instrument of\nownership. A bail-in of a financial\ninstitution may result in a reduction in value\nof some or all of its securities and, if a\nFund holds such securities or has entered into\na transaction with such a financial security\nwhen a bail-in occurs, the Fund may also be\nsimilarly impacted. Credit Risk . Credit risk\nis the risk that an issuer, guarantor or\nliquidity provider of a fixed-income security\nheld by a Fund may be unable or unwilling, or\nmay be perceived (whether by market\nparticipants, ratings agencies, pricing\nservices or otherwise) as unable or unwilling,\nto make timely principal and/or interest\npayments, or to otherwise honor its\nobligations. It includes the risk that the\nsecurity will be downgraded by a credit rating\nagency; generally, lower credit quality\nissuers present higher credit risks. An actual\nor perceived decline in creditworthiness of an\nissuer of a fixed-income security held by a\nFund may result in a decrease in the value of\nthe security. It is possible that the ability\nof an issuer to meet its obligations will\ndecline substantially during the period when a\nFund owns securities of the issuer or that the\nissuer will default on its obligations or that\nthe obligations of the issuer will be limited\nor restructured. The credit rating assigned to\nany particular investment does not necessarily\nreflect the issuer's current financial\ncondition and does not reflect an assessment\nof an investment's volatility or liquidity.\nSecurities rated in the lowest category of\ninvestment-grade are considered to have\nspeculative characteristics. If a security\nheld by a Fund loses its rating or its rating\nis downgraded, the Fund may nonetheless\ncontinue to hold the security in the\ndiscretion of the Adviser. In the case of\nasset-backed or mortgage-related securities,\nchanges in the actual or perceived ability of\nthe obligors on the underlying assets or\nmortgages to make payments of interest and/or\nprincipal may affect the values of those\nsecurities. Debt Securities Risk . The values\nof debt securities may increase or decrease as\na result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates,\nactual or perceived inability or unwillingness\nof issuers, guarantors or liquidity providers\nto make scheduled principal or interest\npayments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets; the risk of low rates of return due\nto reinvestment of securities during periods\nof falling interest rates or repayment by\nissuers with higher coupon or interest rates;\nand/or the risk of low income due to falling\ninterest rates. To the extent that interest\nrates rise, certain underlying obligations may\nbe paid off substantially slower than\noriginally anticipated and the value of those\nsecurities may fall sharply. A rising interest\nrate environment may cause the value of a\nFund's fixed income securities to decrease, a\ndecline in the Fund's income and yield, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of a Fund's\nfixed income securities, and increased\nvolatility of the fixed income markets. The\ncurrent historically low interest rate\nenvironment heightens the risks associated\nwith rising interest rates. During periods\nwhen interest rates are at low levels, a\nFund's yield can be low, and a Fund may have a\nnegative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an\noperating basis). If the principal on a debt\nobligation is prepaid before expected, the\nprepayments of principal may have to be\nreinvested in obligations paying interest at\nlower rates. During periods of falling\ninterest rates, the income received by a Fund\nmay decline. Changes in interest rates will\nlikely have a greater effect on the values of\ndebt securities of longer durations. Returns\non investments in debt securities could trail\nthe returns on other investment options,\nincluding investments in equity securities.\nDerivatives Risk. A derivative is a financial\ncontract the value of which depends on, or is\nderived from, the value of an underlying\nasset, interest rate, or index. Derivative\ntransactions typically involve leverage and\nmay have significant volatility. It is\npossible that a derivative transaction will\nresult in a loss greater than the principal\namount invested, and a Fund may not be able to\nclose out a derivative transaction at a\nfavorable time or price. Risks associated with\nderivative instruments include potential\nchanges in value in response to interest rate\nchanges or other market developments or as a\nresult of the counterparty's credit quality;\nthe potential for the derivative transaction\nnot to have the effect the Adviser anticipated\nor a different or less favorable effect than\nthe Adviser anticipated; the failure of the\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction to\nperform its obligations under the transaction\nor to settle a trade; possible mispricing or\n20 Table of Contents improper valuation of the\nderivative instrument; imperfect correlation\nin the value of a derivative with the asset,\nrate, or index underlying the derivative; the\nrisk that a Fund may be required to post\ncollateral or margin with its counterparty,\nand will not be able to recover the collateral\nor margin in the event of the counterparty's\ninsolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that a Fund\nwill experience losses on its derivatives\ninvestments and on its other portfolio\ninvestments, even when the derivatives\ninvestments may be intended in part or\nentirely to hedge those portfolio investments;\nthe risks specific to the asset underlying the\nderivative instrument; lack of liquidity for\nthe derivative instrument, including without\nlimitation absence of a secondary trading\nmarket; the potential for reduced returns to a\nFund due to losses on the transaction and an\nincrease in volatility; the potential for the\nderivative transaction to have the effect of\naccelerating the recognition of gain; and\nlegal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction.\nFutures Contract Risk; Other Exchange-Traded\nDerivatives Risk . The risk of loss relating\nto the use of futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives is potentially\nunlimited. The ability to establish and close\nout positions in futures contracts and other\nexchange-traded derivatives will be subject to\nthe development and maintenance of a liquid\nsecondary market. There is no assurance that a\nliquid secondary market on an exchange will\nexist for any particular futures contract or\nother exchange-traded derivative or at any\nparticular time. In the event no such market\nexists for a particular derivative, it might\nnot be possible to effect closing\ntransactions, and the Fund will be unable to\nterminate the derivative. In using futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives, the Fund will be reliant on the\nability of the Adviser to predict market and\nprice movements correctly; the skills needed\nto use such derivatives successfully are\ndifferent from those needed for traditional\nportfolio management. If the Fund uses futures\ncontracts or other exchange-traded derivatives\nfor hedging purposes, there is a risk of\nimperfect correlation between movements in the\nprices of the derivatives and movements in the\nsecurities or index underlying the derivatives\nor movements in the prices of the Fund's\ninvestments that are the subject of such\nhedge. The prices of futures and other\nexchange-traded derivatives, for a number of\nreasons, may not correlate perfectly with\nmovements in the securities or index\nunderlying them. For example, participants in\nthe futures markets and in markets for other\nexchange-traded derivatives are subject to\nmargin deposit requirements. Such requirements\nmay cause investors to take actions with\nrespect to their derivatives positions that\nthey would not otherwise take. The margin\nrequirements in the derivatives markets may be\nless onerous than margin requirements in the\nsecurities markets in general, and as a result\nthose markets may attract more speculators\nthan the securities markets do. Increased\nparticipation by speculators in those markets\nmay cause temporary price distortions. Due to\nthe possibility of price distortion, even a\ncorrect forecast of general market trends by\nthe Adviser still may not result in a\nsuccessful derivatives activity over a very\nshort time period. The risk of a position in a\nfutures contract or other exchange-traded\nderivative may be very large compared to the\nrelatively low level of margin the Fund is\nrequired to deposit. In many cases, a\nrelatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and\nsubstantial loss or gain to the investor\nrelative to the size of a required margin\ndeposit. The Fund will incur brokerage fees in\nconnection with its exchange-traded\nderivatives transactions. The Fund will\ntypically be required to post margin with its\nfutures commission merchant in connection with\nits transactions in futures contracts and\nother exchange-traded derivatives. In the\nevent of an insolvency of the futures\ncommission merchant or a clearing house, the\nFund may not be able to recover all (or any)\nof the margin it has posted with the futures\ncommission merchant, or to realize the value\nof any increase in the price of its positions,\nor it may experience a significant delay in\ndoing so. The Fund also may be delayed or\nprevented from recovering margin or other\namounts deposited with a futures commission\nmerchant or futures clearinghouse. The\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (the\n\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the various exchanges have\nestablished limits referred to as \u201cspeculative\nposition limits\u201d on the maximum net long or\nnet short positions that any person and\ncertain affiliated entities may hold or\ncontrol in a particular futures contract.\nTrading limits are imposed on the number of\ncontracts that any person may trade on a\nparticular trading day. An exchange may order\nthe liquidation of positions found to be in\nviolation of these limits and it may impose\nsanctions or restrictions. In addition, the\nDodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to establish\nspeculative position limits on certain\ncommodity futures contracts and their\neconomically equivalent futures, options and\nswaps. Regulatory action taken by the CFTC to\nestablish these additional position limits may\nadversely affect the market liquidity of the\nfutures, options and economically equivalent\nderivatives in which the Fund may invest. It\nis possible that, as a result of such limits,\nthe Fund's Adviser will be precluded from\ntaking positions in certain futures contracts\nor over-the-counter derivatives as a result of\npositions held by other clients of the Adviser\nor by the Adviser or its affiliates\nthemselves. 21 Table of Contents Futures\ncontracts and other exchange-traded\nderivatives traded on markets outside the U.S.\nare not generally subject to the same level of\nregulation by the CFTC or other U.S.\nregulatory entities as contracts traded in the\nU.S., including without limitation as to the\nexecution, delivery, and clearing of\ntransactions. U.S. regulators neither regulate\nthe activities of a foreign exchange, nor have\nthe power to compel enforcement of the rules\nof the foreign exchange or the laws of the\nforeign country in question. Margin and other\npayments made by a Fund may not be afforded\nthe same protections as are afforded those\npayments in the U.S., including in connection\nwith the insolvency of an executing or\nclearing broker or a clearinghouse or\nexchange. Certain foreign futures contracts\nand other exchange-traded derivatives may be\nless liquid and more volatile than U.S.\ncontracts. Swaps Risk. A swap is a two-party\ncontract that generally obligates one party to\npay the positive return and the other party to\npay the negative return on a specified\nreference security, basket of securities,\nsecurity index or index component. Swaps can\ninvolve greater risks than direct investment\nin securities, because swaps may be leveraged\nand are subject to counterparty risk (e.g. ,\nthe risk of a counterparty's defaulting on the\nobligation or bankruptcy), credit risk and\npricing risk (i.e. , swaps may be difficult to\nvalue). Swaps may also be considered illiquid.\nIt may not be possible for a Fund to liquidate\na swap position at an advantageous time or\nprice, which may result in significant losses.\nEquity Investing Risk . The market prices of\nequity securities owned by a Fund may go up or\ndown, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The\nvalue of a security may decline for a number\nof reasons that may directly relate to the\nissuer, such as management performance,\nfinancial leverage, non-compliance with\nregulatory requirements, and reduced demand\nfor the issuer's goods or services. The values\nof equity securities also may decline due to\ngeneral industry or market conditions that are\nnot specifically related to a particular\ncompany, such as real or perceived adverse\neconomic conditions, changes in the general\noutlook for corporate earnings, changes in\ninterest or currency rates, or adverse\ninvestor sentiment generally. In addition,\nequity markets tend to move in cycles, which\nmay cause stock prices to fall over short or\nextended periods of time. ESG Investing Risk .\nAn Index's incorporation of environmental,\nsocial and/or governance considerations in its\nmethodology may cause a Fund to make different\ninvestments than funds that do not incorporate\nsuch considerations in their investment\nstrategy or processes. An Index's\nincorporation of ESG considerations may affect\na Fund's exposure to certain sectors and/or\ntypes of investments, and may adversely impact\na Fund's performance depending on whether such\nsectors or investments are in or out of favor\nin the market. In addition, a Fund's\ninvestments in certain companies may be\nsusceptible to various factors that may impact\ntheir businesses or operations, including\ncosts associated with government budgetary\nconstraints that impact publicly funded\nprojects and clean energy initiatives, the\neffects of general economic conditions\nthroughout the world, increased competition\nfrom other providers of services, unfavorable\ntax laws or accounting policies and high\nleverage. Each Index methodology incorporates\ndata and scores provided by third parties,\nwhich may be unavailable or limited for\ncertain issuers and/or only take into account\none or a few of many ESG related components of\nportfolio companies. In instances where data\nor scores are unavailable or limited, an Index\nmay include, and the corresponding Fund may\ntherefore hold, securities of companies that\notherwise would not be included or held if\ndata or scores were available or more\ncomplete. In addition, ESG information and\nscores across third party data providers,\nindexes and other funds may differ and/or be\nincomparable. A Fund may invest in companies\nthat do not reflect the beliefs and values of\nany particular investor. Extension Risk.\nDuring periods of rising interest rates, the\naverage life of certain types of securities\nmay be extended because of slower-than-\nexpected principal payments. This may increase\nthe period of time during which an investment\nearns a below-market interest rate, increase\nthe security's duration and reduce the value\nof the security. Extension risk may be\nheightened during periods of adverse economic\nconditions generally, as payment rates decline\ndue to higher unemployment levels and other\nfactors. Financial Sector Risk. Financial\nservices companies are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation which may limit both\nthe amounts and types of loans and other\nfinancial commitments they can make, the\ninterest rates and fees they can charge, the\nscope of their activities, the prices they can\ncharge and the amount of capital they must\nmaintain. Profitability is largely dependent\non the availability and cost of capital funds\nand can fluctuate significantly when interest\nrates change or due to increased competition.\nIn addition, deterioration of the credit\nmarkets generally may cause an adverse impact\nin a broad range of markets, including U.S.\nand international credit and interbank money\nmarkets generally, thereby affecting a wide\nrange of financial institutions and markets.\nCertain events in the financial sector may\ncause an unusually high degree of volatility\nin the financial markets, both domestic and\nforeign, and cause certain financial services\ncompanies to incur large losses. Securities of\nfinancial services companies may experience a\ndramatic decline in value when such companies\nexperience substantial declines in the\nvaluations of their assets, 22 Table of\nContents take action to raise capital (such as\nthe issuance of debt or equity securities), or\ncease operations. Credit losses resulting from\nfinancial difficulties of borrowers and\nfinancial losses associated with investment\nactivities can negatively impact the sector.\nInsurance companies may be subject to severe\nprice competition. Adverse economic, business\nor political developments could adversely\naffect financial institutions engaged in\nmortgage finance or other lending or investing\nactivities directly or indirectly connected to\nthe value of real estate. Fluctuation of Net\nAsset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk\n. The net asset value of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate with changes in the market\nvalue of a Fund's securities holdings. The\nmarket prices of Fund Shares will generally\nfluctuate in accordance with changes in a\nFund's net asset value and supply and demand\nof Fund Shares on the Exchange. It cannot be\npredicted whether Fund Shares will trade\nbelow, at or above their net asset value.\nPrice differences may be due, in large part,\nto the fact that supply and demand forces at\nwork in the secondary trading market for Fund\nShares will be closely related to, but not\nidentical to, the same forces influencing the\nprices of the securities of the Index trading\nindividually or in the aggregate at any point\nin time. The market prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the net asset value\nof Fund Shares during periods of market\nvolatility. However, given that Fund Shares\ncan be created and redeemed in Creation Units\n(unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable discounts\nfrom, and sometimes at premiums to, their net\nasset value), the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts or premiums to the net asset value\nof Fund Shares should not be sustained over\nlong periods. While the creation/redemption\nfeature is designed to make it likely that\nFund Shares normally will trade close to a\nFund's net asset value, disruptions to\ncreations and redemptions or market volatility\nmay result in trading prices that differ\nsignificantly from the Fund's net asset value.\nIf an investor purchases Fund Shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a premium to the\nnet asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a\ntime when the market price is at a discount to\nthe net asset value of Fund Shares, then the\ninvestor may sustain losses. Gender Diversity\nRisk . The returns on a portfolio of\nsecurities that excludes companies that are\nnot gender diverse may trail the returns on a\nportfolio of securities that includes\ncompanies that are not gender diverse.\nInvesting only in a portfolio of securities\nthat are gender diverse may affect a Fund's\nexposure to certain types of investments and\nmay adversely impact a Fund's performance\ndepending on whether such investments are in\nor out of favor in the market. Income Risk. A\nFund's income may decline due to falling\ninterest rates or other factors. Issuers of\nsecurities held by a Fund may call or redeem\nthe securities during periods of falling\ninterest rates, and the Fund would likely be\nrequired to reinvest in securities paying\nlower interest rates. If an obligation held by\na Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to\nreinvest the prepayment in other obligations\npaying income at lower rates. A reduction in\nthe income earned by a Fund may limit the\nFund's ability to achieve its objective.\nIndexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk . Each\nFund is managed with an indexing investment\nstrategy, attempting to track the performance\nof an unmanaged index of securities. Each Fund\nwill seek to replicate Index returns,\nregardless of the current or projected\nperformance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs\nfrom an actively-managed fund, which typically\nseeks to outperform a benchmark index. Each\nFund generally will buy and will not sell a\nsecurity included in the Index as long as the\nsecurity is part of the Index regardless of\nany sudden or material decline in value or\nforeseeable material decline in value of the\nsecurity, even though the Adviser may make a\ndifferent investment decision for other\nactively managed accounts or portfolios that\nhold the security. As a result, a Fund's\nperformance may be less favorable than that of\na portfolio managed using an active investment\nstrategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Index (in absolute terms and\nby comparison with other indices) and,\nconsequently, the performance, volatility, and\nrisk of a Fund. Errors in index data, index\ncomputations or the construction of the Index\nin accordance with its methodology may occur\nfrom time to time and may not be identified\nand corrected by the Index Provider for a\nperiod of time or at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on a Fund and its shareholders.\nWhile the Adviser seeks to track the\nperformance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with the Index), a\nFund's return may not match the return of the\nIndex for a number of reasons. For example,\nthe return on the sample of securities\npurchased by a Fund (or the return on\nsecurities not included in the Index) to\nreplicate the performance of the Index may not\ncorrelate precisely with the return of the\nIndex. Each Fund incurs a number of operating\nexpenses not applicable to the Index, and\nincurs costs in buying and selling securities.\nIn addition, a Fund may not be fully invested\nat times, either as a result of cash flows\ninto or out of the Fund or reserves of cash\nheld by the Fund to meet redemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to track the Index return\nby investing in fewer than all of the\nsecurities in the Index, or in some securities\nnot included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between a\nFund's return and that of the Index. Changes\nin the composition of the Index and regulatory\nrequirements also may impact a Fund's ability\nto match the return of the 23 Table of\nContents Index. The Adviser may apply one or\nmore \u201cscreens\u201d or investment techniques to\nrefine or limit the number or types of issuers\nincluded in the Index in which a Fund may\ninvest. Application of such screens or\ntechniques may result in investment\nperformance below that of the Index and may\nnot produce results expected by the Adviser.\nIndex tracking risk may be heightened during\ntimes of increased market volatility or other\nunusual market conditions. Pursuant to the\nIndex methodology, a security may be removed\nfrom the Index in the event that it does not\ncomply with the eligibility requirements of\nthe Index. As a result, a Fund may be forced\nto sell securities at inopportune times and/or\nunfavorable prices due to these changes in the\nIndex components. When there are changes made\nto the component securities of the Index and a\nFund in turn makes similar changes to its\nportfolio to attempt to increase the\ncorrelation between a Fund's portfolio and the\nIndex, any transaction costs and market\nexposure arising from such portfolio changes\nwill be borne directly by a Fund and its\nshareholders. Unscheduled changes to the Index\nmay expose a Fund to additional tracking error\nrisk. A Fund may recognize gains as a result\nof rebalancing or reconstituting its\nsecurities holdings to reflect changes in the\nsecurities included in the Index. A Fund also\nmay be required to distribute any such gains\nto its shareholders to avoid adverse federal\nincome tax consequences. Industrial Sector\nRisk . Industrial companies are affected by\nsupply and demand both for their specific\nproduct or service and for industrial sector\nproducts in general. Government regulation,\nworld events, exchange rates and economic\nconditions, technological developments and\nliabilities for environmental damage and\ngeneral civil liabilities will likewise affect\nthe performance of these companies. Aerospace\nand defense companies, a component of the\nindustrial sector, can be significantly\naffected by government spending policies\nbecause companies involved in this industry\nrely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and\nforeign government demand for their products\nand services. Thus, the financial condition\nof, and investor interest in, aerospace and\ndefense companies are heavily influenced by\ngovernmental defense spending policies which\nare typically under pressure from efforts to\ncontrol the U.S. (and other) government\nbudgets. Transportation securities, a\ncomponent of the industrial sector, are\ncyclical and have occasional sharp price\nmovements which may result from changes in the\neconomy, fuel prices, labor agreements and\ninsurance costs. Interest Rate Risk . Interest\nrate risk is the risk that the securities held\nby a Fund will decline in value because of\nincreases in market interest rates. Duration\nis a measure used to determine the sensitivity\nof a security's price to changes in interest\nrates. Debt securities with longer durations\ntend to be more sensitive to changes in\ninterest rates, usually making them more\nvolatile than debt securities with shorter\ndurations. For example, the value of a\nsecurity with a duration of five years would\nbe expected to decrease by 5% for every 1%\nincrease in interest rates. Falling interest\nrates also create the potential for a decline\nin a Fund's income and yield. Interest-only\nand principal-only securities are especially\nsensitive to interest rate changes, which can\naffect not only their prices but can also\nchange the income flows and repayment\nassumptions about those investments. Variable\nand floating rate securities also generally\nincrease or decrease in value in response to\nchanges in interest rates, although generally\nto a lesser degree than fixed-rate securities.\nA substantial increase in interest rates may\nalso have an adverse impact on the liquidity\nof a security, especially those with longer\ndurations. Interest rate changes can be sudden\nand unpredictable, and are influenced by a\nnumber of factors, including government\npolicy, monetary policy, inflation\nexpectations, perceptions of risk, and supply\nand demand for bonds. Changes in government or\ncentral bank policy, including changes in tax\npolicy or changes in a central bank's\nimplementation of specific policy goals, may\nhave a substantial impact on interest rates.\nThis could lead to heightened levels of\ninterest rate, volatility and liquidity risks\nfor the fixed income markets generally and\ncould have a substantial and immediate effect\non the values of the Fund's investments. There\ncan be no guarantee that any particular\ngovernment or central bank policy will be\ncontinued, discontinued or changed, nor that\nany such policy will have the desired effect\non interest rates. Large-Capitalization\nSecurities Risk. Securities issued by large-\ncapitalization companies may present risks not\npresent in smaller companies. For example,\nlarger companies may be unable to respond as\nquickly as smaller and mid-sized companies to\ncompetitive challenges or to changes in\nbusiness, product, financial, or other market\nconditions. Larger companies may not be able\nto maintain growth at the high rates that may\nbe achieved by well-managed smaller and mid-\nsized companies, especially during strong\neconomic periods. Returns on investments in\nsecurities of large companies could trail the\nreturns on investments in securities of\nsmaller and mid-sized companies. Leveraging\nRisk . Borrowing transactions, reverse\nrepurchase agreements, certain derivatives\ntransactions, securities lending transactions\nand other investment transactions such as\nwhen-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward\ncommitment transactions may create investment\nleverage. If a Fund engages in transactions\nthat have a leveraging effect on the 24 Table\nof Contents Fund's investment portfolio, the\nvalue of the Fund will be potentially more\nvolatile and all other risks will tend to be\ncompounded. This is because leverage generally\ncreates investment risk with respect to a\nlarger base of assets than a Fund would\notherwise have and so magnifies the effect of\nany increase or decrease in the value of the\nFund's underlying assets. The use of leverage\nis considered to be a speculative investment\npractice and may result in losses to a Fund.\nCertain derivatives have the potential for\nunlimited loss, regardless of the size of the\ninitial investment. The use of leverage may\ncause a Fund to liquidate positions when it\nmay not be advantageous to do so to satisfy\nrepayment, interest payment, or margin\nobligations or to meet asset segregation or\ncoverage requirements. Limited Track Record\nRisk . The Fund has a limited track record and\nthere is no assurance that the Fund will grow\nquickly. When the Fund's size is small, the\nFund may experience low trading volume, which\ncould lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In\naddition, the Fund may face the risk of being\ndelisted if the Fund does not meet certain\nconditions of the listing exchange. Any\nresulting liquidation of the Fund could cause\nelevated transaction costs for the Fund and\nnegative tax consequences for its\nshareholders. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk\nis the risk that a Fund may not be able to\ndispose of securities or close out derivatives\ntransactions readily at a favorable time or\nprices (or at all) or at prices approximating\nthose at which a Fund currently values them.\nFor example, certain investments may be\nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade\nin the over-the-counter market or in limited\nvolume, or may not have an active trading\nmarket. Illiquid investments may trade at a\ndiscount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide\nfluctuations in market value. It may be\ndifficult for a Fund to value illiquid\ninvestments accurately. The market for certain\ninvestments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of\nany specific adverse changes in the conditions\nof a particular issuer. If the liquidity of a\nFund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to\ndifferences between the market price of Fund\nShares and the net asset value of Fund Shares,\nand could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Disposal of illiquid investments may\nentail registration expenses and other\ntransaction costs that are higher than those\nfor liquid securities. A Fund may seek to\nborrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption\nobligations) if it is unable to dispose of\nilliquid investments, resulting in borrowing\nexpenses and possible leveraging of the Fund.\nMarket Risk . Market prices of investments\nheld by a Fund will go up or down, sometimes\nrapidly or unpredictably. A Fund's investments\nare subject to changes in general economic\nconditions, general market fluctuations and\nthe risks inherent in investment in securities\nmarkets. Investment markets can be volatile,\nand prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors\nincluding, but not limited to, economic growth\nor recession, changes in interest rates,\nchanges in actual or perceived\ncreditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions\ndo not change, the value of an investment in a\nFund could decline if the particular\nindustries, sectors or companies in which the\nFund invests do not perform well or are\nadversely affected by events. Further, legal,\npolitical, regulatory and tax changes also may\ncause fluctuations in markets and securities\nprices. Local, regional or global events such\nas war, acts of terrorism, the spread of\ninfectious illness or other public health\nissues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on a Fund and its\ninvestments. An outbreak of a respiratory\ndisease caused by a novel coronavirus (known\nas COVID-19) first detected in China in\nDecember 2019 has resulted in a global\npandemic and major disruptions to economies\nand markets around the world, including the\nUnited States. Financial markets experienced\nand may continue to experience extreme\nvolatility and severe losses, and trading in\nmany instruments was and may continue to be\ndisrupted as a result. Liquidity for many\ninstruments was and may continue to be greatly\nreduced for periods of time. Some interest\nrates are very low and in some cases yields\nare negative. Governments and central banks,\nincluding the Federal Reserve in the United\nStates, have taken extraordinary and\nunprecedented actions to support local and\nglobal economies and the financial markets.\nThe impact of these measures, and whether they\nwill be effective to mitigate the economic and\nmarket disruption, will not be known for some\ntime. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19,\nand measures taken to mitigate its effects,\ncould result in disruptions to the services\nprovided to a Fund by its service providers.\nNon-Diversification Risk . Funds classified as\n\u201cnon-diversified\u201d may hold a smaller number of\nportfolio securities than many other funds. To\nthe extent a Fund invests in a relatively\nsmall number of issuers, a decline in the\nmarket value of a particular security held by\nthe Fund may affect its value more than if it\ninvested in a larger number of issuers. The\nvalue of Fund Shares may be more volatile than\nthe values of shares of more diversified\nfunds. A diversified Fund may become non-\ndiversified for periods of time solely as a\nresult of tracking its Index (e.g., changes in\nweightings of one or more component\nsecurities). 25 Table of Contents Non-U.S.\nSecurities Risk . Investments in securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers (including depositary\nreceipts) entail risks not typically\nassociated with investing in securities of\nU.S. issuers. Similar risks may apply to\nsecurities traded on a U.S. securities\nexchange that are issued by entities with\nsignificant exposure to non-U.S. countries. In\ncertain countries, legal remedies available to\ninvestors may be more limited than those\navailable with regard to U.S. investments.\nBecause non-U.S. securities are typically\ndenominated and traded in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar, the value of the Fund's\nassets, to the extent they are non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated, may be affected favorably or\nunfavorably by currency exchange rates,\nexchange control regulations, and restrictions\nor prohibitions on the repatriation of\nnon-U.S. currencies. To the extent underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund trade on foreign\nexchanges that are closed when the exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares trade is open, there\nmay be deviations between the current price of\nan underlying security and the last quoted\nprice for the underlying security on the\nclosed foreign market. These deviations could\nresult in the Fund experiencing premiums or\ndiscounts greater than those of ETFs that\ninvest in domestic securities. Income and\ngains with respect to investments in certain\ncountries may be subject to withholding and\nother taxes. There may be less information\npublicly available about a non-U.S. entity\nthan about a U.S. entity, and many non-U.S.\nentities are not subject to accounting,\nauditing, and financial reporting standards,\nregulatory framework and practices comparable\nto those in the United States. The securities\nof some non-U.S. entities are less liquid and\nat times more volatile than securities of\ncomparable U.S. entities, and could become\nsubject to sanctions or embargoes that\nadversely affect a Fund's investment. Non-U.S.\ntransaction costs, such as brokerage\ncommissions and custody costs may be higher\nthan in the U.S. In addition, there may be a\npossibility of nationalization or\nexpropriation of assets, imposition of\ncurrency exchange controls, confiscatory\ntaxation, and diplomatic developments that\ncould adversely affect the values of a Fund's\ninvestments in certain non-U.S. countries.\nInvestments in securities of non-U.S. issuers\nalso are subject to foreign political and\neconomic risk not associated with U.S.\ninvestments, meaning that political events\n(civil unrest, national elections, changes in\npolitical conditions and foreign relations,\nimposition of exchange controls and\nrepatriation restrictions), social and\neconomic events (labor strikes, rising\ninflation) and natural disasters occurring in\na country where a Fund invests could cause the\nFund's investments in that country to\nexperience gains or losses. Certain countries\nhave recently experienced (or currently are\nexpected to experience) negative interest\nrates on certain fixed-income securities, and\nsimilar interest rate conditions may be\nexperienced in other regions. Investments in\nfixed-income securities with very low or\nnegative interest rates may magnify the Fund's\nsusceptibility to interest rate risk and\ndiminish yield and performance, and such\ninvestments may be subject to heightened\nvolatility and reduced liquidity. Reinvestment\nRisk. Income from a Fund's portfolio may\ndecline when the Fund invests the proceeds\nfrom investment income, sales of portfolio\nsecurities or matured, traded or called debt\nobligations. For instance, during periods of\ndeclining interest rates, an issuer of debt\nobligations may exercise an option to redeem\nsecurities prior to maturity, forcing a Fund\nto reinvest the proceeds in lower-yielding\nsecurities. A decline in income received by a\nFund from its investments is likely to have a\nnegative effect on the yield and total return\nof the Fund Shares. Settlement Risk . Markets\nin different countries have different\nclearance and settlement procedures and in\ncertain markets there have been times when\nsettlements have been unable to keep pace with\nthe volume of transactions. Delays in\nsettlement may increase credit risk to a Fund,\nlimit the ability of a Fund to reinvest the\nproceeds of a sale of securities, hinder the\nability of a Fund to lend its portfolio\nsecurities, and potentially subject a Fund to\npenalties for its failure to deliver to on-\npurchasers of securities whose delivery to a\nFund was delayed. Delays in the settlement of\nsecurities purchased by a Fund may limit the\nability of a Fund to sell those securities at\ntimes and prices it considers desirable, and\nmay subject a Fund to losses and costs due to\nits own inability to settle with subsequent\npurchasers of the securities from it. A Fund\nmay be required to borrow monies it had\notherwise expected to receive in connection\nwith the settlement of securities sold by it,\nin order to meet its obligations to others.\nLimits on the ability of the Fund to purchase\nor sell securities due to settlement delays\ncould increase any variance between the Fund's\nperformance and that of its benchmark index.\nTechnology Sector Risk . Market or economic\nfactors impacting technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technological\nadvances could have a major effect on the\nvalue of the Fund's investments. The value of\nstocks of technology companies and companies\nthat rely heavily on technology is\nparticularly vulnerable to rapid changes in\ntechnology product cycles, rapid product\nobsolescence, government regulation and\ncompetition, both domestically and\ninternationally, including competition from\nforeign competitors with lower production\ncosts. Technology companies may have limited\nproduct lines, markets, financial resources or\npersonnel. Stocks of technology companies and\ncompanies that rely heavily on technology,\nespecially those of smaller, less-seasoned\ncompanies, tend to be more volatile than 26\nTable of Contents the overall market.\nTechnology companies are heavily dependent on\npatent and intellectual property rights, the\nloss or impairment of which may adversely\naffect profitability. Additionally, companies\nin the technology sector may face dramatic and\noften unpredictable changes in growth rates\nand competition for the services of qualified\npersonnel. Unconstrained Sector Risk . A Fund\nmay invest a substantial portion of its assets\nwithin one or more economic sectors or\nindustries, which may change from time to\ntime. When a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nValuation Risk . Some portfolio holdings,\npotentially a large portion of the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, may be valued on the\nbasis of factors other than market quotations.\nThis may occur more often in times of market\nturmoil or reduced liquidity. There are\nmultiple methods that can be used to value a\nportfolio holding when market quotations are\nnot readily available. The value established\nfor any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using\na different methodology or if it had been\npriced using market quotations. Portfolio\nholdings that are valued using techniques\nother than market quotations, including \u201cfair\nvalued\u201d securities, may be subject to greater\nfluctuation in their valuations from one day\nto the next than if market quotations were\nused. Technological issues or other service\ndisruption issues involving third-party\nservice providers may cause a Fund to value\nits investments incorrectly. In addition,\nthere is no assurance that a Fund could sell\nor close out a portfolio position for the\nvalue established for it at any time, and it\nis possible that a Fund would incur a loss\nbecause a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established\nby a Fund at that time. Non-Principal Risks\nEach risk discussed below is a non-principal\nrisk of a Fund to the extent it is not\nidentified as a principal risk for such Fund\nin the preceding \u201cADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION\n- PRINCIPAL RISKS\u201d section. Authorized\nParticipants, Market Makers and Liquidity\nProviders Concentration Risk. A Fund has a\nlimited number of financial institutions that\nmay act as Authorized Participants (\u201cAPs\u201d),\nwhich are responsible for the creation and\nredemption activity for a Fund. In addition,\nthere may be a limited number of market makers\nand/or liquidity providers in the marketplace.\nTo the extent either of the following events\noccur, Fund Shares may trade at a material\ndiscount to NAV and possibly face delisting:\n(i) APs exit the business or otherwise become\nunable to process creation and/or redemption\norders and no other APs step forward to\nperform these services, or (ii) market makers\nand/or liquidity providers exit the business\nor significantly reduce their business\nactivities and no other entities step forward\nto perform their functions. Cash Transaction\nRisk . To the extent a Fund sells portfolio\nsecurities to meet some or all of a redemption\nrequest with cash, the Fund may incur taxable\ngains or losses that it might not have\nincurred had it made redemptions entirely in-\nkind. As a result, a Fund may pay out higher\nannual capital gain distributions than if the\nin-kind redemption process was used.\nConcentration Risk . A Fund's assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the extent that the\nFund's underlying Index concentrates in a\nparticular industry or group of industries.\nWhen a Fund focuses its investments in a\nparticular industry or sector, financial,\neconomic, business, and other developments\naffecting issuers in that industry, market, or\neconomic sector will have a greater effect on\nthe Fund than if it had not focused its assets\nin that industry, market, or economic sector,\nwhich may increase the volatility of the Fund.\nConflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in a\nFund will be subject to a number of actual or\npotential conflicts of interest. For example,\nthe Adviser or its affiliates may provide\nservices to a Fund, such as securities lending\nagency services, custodial, administrative,\nbookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer\nagency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for\nwhich the Fund would compensate the Adviser\nand/or such affiliates. The Funds may invest\nin other pooled investment vehicles sponsored,\nmanaged, or otherwise affiliated with the\nAdviser. There is no assurance that the rates\nat which a Fund pays fees or expenses to the\nAdviser or its affiliates, or the terms on\nwhich it enters into transactions with the\nAdviser or its affiliates will be the most\nfavorable available in the market generally or\nas favorable as the rates the Adviser or its\naffiliates make available to other clients.\nBecause of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into\ntransactions or arrangements on behalf of a\nFund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so\nin the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements. 27 Table of Contents\nThe Adviser and its affiliates serve as\ninvestment adviser to other clients and may\nmake investment decisions that may be\ndifferent from those that will be made by the\nAdviser on behalf of the Funds. For example,\nthe Adviser may provide asset allocation\nadvice to some clients that may include a\nrecommendation to invest in or redeem from\nparticular issuers while not providing that\nsame recommendation to all clients invested in\nthe same or similar issuers. The Adviser may\n(subject to applicable law) be simultaneously\nseeking to purchase (or sell) investments for\na Fund and to sell (or purchase) the same\ninvestment for accounts, funds, or structured\nproducts for which it serves as asset manager,\nor for other clients or affiliates. The\nAdviser and its affiliates may invest for\nclients in various securities that are senior,\npari passuor junior to, or have interests\ndifferent from or adverse to, the securities\nthat are owned by a Fund. The Adviser or its\naffiliates, in connection with its other\nbusiness activities, may acquire material\nnonpublic confidential information that may\nrestrict the Adviser from purchasing\nsecurities or selling securities for itself or\nits clients (including the Funds) or otherwise\nusing such information for the benefit of its\nclients or itself. The foregoing does not\npurport to be a comprehensive list or complete\nexplanation of all potential conflicts of\ninterests which may affect a Fund. A Fund may\nencounter circumstances, or enter into\ntransactions, in which conflicts of interest\nthat are not listed or discussed above may\narise. Costs of Buying and Selling Shares .\nInvestors buying or selling Fund Shares in the\nsecondary market will pay brokerage\ncommissions or other charges imposed by\nbrokers, as determined by that broker.\nBrokerage commissions are often a fixed amount\nand may be a significant proportional cost for\ninvestors seeking to buy or sell relatively\nsmall amounts of Fund Shares. In addition,\nsecondary market investors will also incur the\ncost of the difference between the price that\nan investor is willing to pay for Fund Shares\n(the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which an\ninvestor is willing to sell Fund Shares (the\n\u201cask\u201d price). This difference in bid and ask\nprices is often referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or\n\u201cbid/ask spread.\u201d The bid/ask spread varies\nover time for Fund Shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and is generally\nlower if Fund Shares have more trading volume\nand market liquidity and higher if Fund Shares\nhave little trading volume and market\nliquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask\nspreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling\nFund Shares, including bid/ask spreads,\nfrequent trading of Fund Shares may\nsignificantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate regularly making\nsmall investments. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the\nInternet and the dependence on computer\nsystems to perform business and operational\nfunctions, funds (such as the Funds) and their\nservice providers (including the Adviser) may\nbe prone to operational and information\nsecurity risks resulting from cyber-attacks\nand/or technological malfunctions. In general,\ncyber-attacks are deliberate, but\nunintentional events may have similar effects.\nCyber-attacks include, among others, stealing\nor corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from\naccessing information or services on a\nwebsite, releasing confidential information\nwithout authorization, and causing operational\ndisruption. Successful cyber-attacks against,\nor security breakdowns of, a Fund, the Adviser\nor a custodian, transfer agent, or other\naffiliated or third-party service provider may\nadversely affect a Fund or its shareholders.\nFor instance, cyber-attacks or technical\nmalfunctions may interfere with the processing\nof shareholder or other transactions, affect a\nFund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the\nrelease of private shareholder information or\nconfidential Fund information, impede trading,\ncause reputational damage, and subject a Fund\nto regulatory fines, penalties or financial\nlosses, reimbursement or other compensation\ncosts, and additional compliance costs. Cyber-\nattacks or technical malfunctions may render\nrecords of Fund assets and transactions,\nshareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and\nother data integral to the functioning of a\nFund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete.\nA Fund may also incur substantial costs for\ncybersecurity risk management in order to\nprevent cyber incidents in the future. A Fund\nand its shareholders could be negatively\nimpacted as a result. While the Adviser has\nestablished business continuity plans and\nsystems designed to minimize the risk of\ncyber-attacks through the use of technology,\nprocesses and controls, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and systems,\nincluding the possibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, given the evolving\nnature of this threat. Each Fund relies on\nthird-party service providers for many of its\nday-to-day operations, and will be subject to\nthe risk that the protections and protocols\nimplemented by those service providers will be\nineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-\nattack. The Adviser does not control the\ncybersecurity plans and systems put in place\nby third-party service providers, and such\nthird-party service providers may have limited\nindemnification obligations to the Adviser or\nthe Funds. Similar types of cybersecurity\nrisks or technical malfunctions also are\npresent for issuers of securities in which\neach Fund invests, which could result in\nmaterial adverse consequences for such\nissuers, and may cause a Fund's investment in\nsuch securities to lose value. 28 Table of\nContents Index Construction Risk . A security\nincluded in an Index may not exhibit the\ncharacteristic or provide the specific\nexposure for which it was selected and\nconsequently a Fund's holdings may not exhibit\nreturns consistent with that characteristic or\nexposure. Index Licensing Risk . It is\npossible that the license under which the\nAdviser or a Fund is permitted to replicate or\notherwise use an Index will be terminated or\nmay be disputed, impaired or cease to remain\nin effect. In such a case, the Adviser may be\nrequired to replace the Index with another\nindex which it considers to be appropriate in\nlight of the investment strategy of a Fund.\nThe use of any such substitute index may have\nan adverse impact on a Fund's performance. In\nthe event that the Adviser is unable to\nidentify a suitable replacement for the Index,\nit may determine to terminate a Fund. Money\nMarket Risk . An investment in a money market\nfund is not a deposit of any bank and is not\ninsured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other\ngovernment agency. Certain money market funds\nseek to preserve the value of their shares at\n$1.00 per share, although there can be no\nassurance that they will do so, and it is\npossible to lose money by investing in such a\nmoney market fund. A major or unexpected\nchange in interest rates or a decline in the\ncredit quality of an issuer or entity\nproviding credit support, an inactive trading\nmarket for money market instruments, or\nadverse market, economic, industry, political,\nregulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions\ncould cause the share price of such a money\nmarket fund to fall below $1.00. It is\npossible that such a money market fund will\nissue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at\ntimes when the fair value of the money market\nfund's portfolio per share is more or less\nthan $1.00. None of State Street Corporation,\nState Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState\nStreet\u201d), State Street Global Advisors, Inc.\n(\u201cSSGA\u201d), SSGA FM or their affiliates (\u201cState\nStreet Entities\u201d) guarantee the value of an\ninvestment in a money market fund at $1.00 per\nshare. Investors should have no expectation of\ncapital support to a money market fund from\nState Street Entities. Other money market\nfunds price and transact at a \u201cfloating\u201d NAV\nthat will fluctuate along with changes in the\nmarket-based value of fund assets. Shares sold\nutilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or\nless than their original purchase price.\nRecent changes in the regulation of money\nmarket funds may affect the operations and\nstructures of money market funds. A money\nmarket fund may be permitted or required to\nimpose redemption fees or to impose\nlimitations on redemptions during periods of\nhigh illiquidity in the markets for the\ninvestments held by it. Portfolio Turnover\nRisk . A Fund may engage in frequent trading\nof its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and\nindirect costs and expenses to a Fund,\nincluding, for example, brokerage commissions,\ndealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and\ntransaction costs on the sale of securities\nand reinvestment in other securities. The\ncosts related to increased portfolio turnover\nmay have the effect of reducing a Fund's\ninvestment return, and the sale of securities\nby the Fund may result in the realization of\ntaxable capital gains, including short-term\ncapital gains. A Fund may engage in\nsignificant trading of its portfolio\nsecurities in connection with Index\nrebalancing. Frequent or significant trading\nmay cause a Fund to incur additional\ntransaction costs and experience different tax\nconsequences in comparison to an ETF that does\nnot engage in frequent or significant trading.\nSecurities Lending Risk. Each Fund may lend\nportfolio securities in an amount not to\nexceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For\nthese purposes, net assets shall exclude the\nvalue of all assets received as collateral for\nthe loan. Such loans may be terminated at any\ntime. Any such loans must be continuously\nsecured by collateral maintained on a current\nbasis in an amount at least equal to the\nmarket value of the securities loaned by a\nFund, marked to market each trading day. In a\nloan transaction, as compensation for lending\nits securities, a Fund will receive a portion\nof the dividends or interest accrued on the\nsecurities held as collateral or, in the case\nof cash collateral, a portion of the income\nfrom the investment of such cash. In addition,\na Fund will receive the amount of all\ndividends, interest and other distributions on\nthe loaned securities. However, the borrower\nhas the right to vote the loaned securities. A\nFund will call loans to vote proxies if a\nmaterial issue affecting the investment is to\nbe voted upon. Efforts to recall such\nsecurities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly\ntraded securities, and may involve expenses to\na Fund. Securities lending involves the risk\nthat the Fund may lose money because the\nborrower of the loaned securities fails to\nreturn the securities in a timely manner or at\nall. Should the borrower of the securities\nfail financially, a Fund may experience delays\nin recovering the securities or exercising its\nrights in the collateral. Loans are made only\nto borrowers that are deemed by the securities\nlending agent to be of good financial\nstanding. In a loan transaction, a Fund will\nalso bear the risk of any decline in value of\nsecurities provided as collateral or acquired\nwith cash collateral. Each Fund will attempt\nto minimize this risk by limiting the\ninvestment of cash collateral to high quality\ninstruments of short maturity either directly\non behalf of the lending Fund or through one\nor more joint accounts or funds, which may\ninclude those managed by the Adviser. To the\nextent the collateral provided or investments\nmade 29\n\nTable of Contents\n\nwith cash collateral differ from securities\nincluded in the Index, such collateral or\ninvestments may have a greater risk of loss\nthan the securities included in the Index. In\naddition, a Fund will be subject to the risk\nthat any income generated by lending its\nsecurities or reinvesting cash collateral is\nlower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay\na borrower. The Adviser will take into account\nthe tax impact to shareholders of substitute\npayments for dividends when overseeing a\nFund's securities lending activity. Trading\nIssues . Although Fund Shares are listed for\ntrading on the Exchange and may be listed or\ntraded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges\nother than the Exchange, there can be no\nassurance that an active trading market for\nthe Fund Shares will develop or be maintained.\nTrading in Fund Shares on the Exchange may be\nhalted due to market conditions or for reasons\nthat, in the view of the Exchange, make\ntrading in Fund Shares inadvisable. In\naddition, trading in Fund Shares on the\nExchange is subject to trading halts caused by\nextraordinary market volatility pursuant to\nExchange \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d rules. Similar to\nthe shares of operating companies listed on a\nstock exchange, Fund Shares may be sold short\nand are therefore subject to the risk of\nincreased volatility in the trading price of\nthe Fund's shares. While each Fund expects\nthat the ability of Authorized Participants to\ncreate and redeem Fund Shares at net asset\nvalue should be effective in reducing any such\nvolatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such\nshort sales. There can be no assurance that\nthe requirements of the Exchange necessary to\nmaintain the listing of a Fund will continue\nto be met or will remain unchanged or that\nFund Shares will trade with any volume, or at\nall, on any stock exchange. Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the\ninvestment adviser to each Fund and, subject\nto the oversight of the Board, is responsible\nfor the investment management of each Fund.\nThe Adviser provides an investment management\nprogram for each Fund and manages the\ninvestment of each Fund's assets. The Adviser\nis a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nGlobal Advisors, Inc., which itself is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation. The Adviser is registered with\nthe SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940, as amended. The Adviser and certain\nother affiliates of State Street Corporation\nmake up SSGA. SSGA is one of the world's\nlargest institutional money managers and the\ninvestment management arm of State Street\nCorporation. As of June 30, 2021, the Adviser\nmanaged approximately $788.65 billion in\nassets and SSGA managed approximately $3.90\ntrillion in assets. The Adviser's principal\nbusiness address is One Iron Street, Boston,\nMassachusetts 02210. For the services provided\nto each Fund under the Investment Advisory\nAgreement, for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2021, each Fund paid the Adviser the annual\nfees based on a percentage of each Fund's\naverage daily net assets as set forth below:\n                                              \n  SPDR Bloomberg SASB Corporate     0.12%(1)  \n  Bond ESG Select ETF                         \n  SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF              0.10%(2)  \n  SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index  0.20%     \n  ETF                                         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (1)  The Fund commenced operations on       \n       November 9, 2020.                      \n  (2)  The Fund commenced operations on July  \n       28, 2020.                              \n                                              \nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all\nor a portion of its management fee. The\nAdviser has contractually agreed to waive a\nportion of its management fee and/or reimburse\nexpenses in an amount equal to any acquired\nfund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in\nacquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) for each Fund until October 31, 2022.\nThis waiver and/or reimbursement does not\nprovide for the recoupment by the Adviser of\nany amounts waived or reimbursed. This waiver\nand/or reimbursement may not be terminated\nprior to October 31, 2022 except with the\napproval of the Board. The Adviser pays all\nexpenses of each Fund other than the\nmanagement fee, brokerage expenses, taxes,\ninterest, fees and expenses of the Independent\nTrustees (including any Trustee's counsel\nfees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees\nand expenses and other extraordinary expenses.\nA discussion regarding the Board's\nconsideration of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement is provided in the Funds' Annual\nReport to Shareholders for the period ended\nJune 30, 2021. SSGA FM, as the investment\nadviser for the Funds, may hire one or more\nsub-advisers to oversee the day-to-day\ninvestment activities of the Funds. The sub-\nadvisers are subject to oversight by the\nAdviser. The Adviser and SPDR Series Trust\n(the \u201cTrust\u201d) have received an exemptive order\nfrom the SEC that permits the Adviser, with\nthe approval of\n\n30\n\nTable of Contents\n\nthe Independent Trustees of the Trust, to\nretain and amend existing sub-advisory\nagreements with unaffiliated investment sub-\nadvisers for a Fund without submitting the\nsub-advisory agreement to a vote of the Fund's\nshareholders. The Trust will notify\nshareholders in the event of any change in the\nidentity of such sub-adviser or sub-advisers.\nThe Adviser has ultimate responsibility for\nthe investment performance of the Funds due to\nits responsibility to oversee each sub-adviser\nand recommend their hiring, termination and\nreplacement. The Adviser is not required to\ndisclose fees paid to any unaffiliated sub-\nadviser retained pursuant to the order. With\nrespect to the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity\nIndex ETF, the Adviser and certain of its\naffiliates intend to make contributions to a\ncharitable organization, which is tax-exempt\nunder section 501(c)(3) of the Code, developed\nto provide financial support to third party\ncharitable organizations which seek to enhance\ngender equity through educational efforts.\nCharitable contributions from the Adviser and\ncertain of its affiliates will be benchmarked\nto the assets under management of the Fund.\nThe charitable organization will seek to make\ndonations to identified charitable\norganizations that support continuing\neducational efforts designed to mitigate\ngender inequality in corporate America, and\nwill aim to engage with other organizations in\nan effort to increase the amount of\nphilanthropic dollars available for such\ninitiatives. The charitable organization will\nnot participate in, or have any influence on\nthe day-to-day operations of, the Fund or the\nAdviser's management of the Fund. Portfolio\nManagers.\nThe Adviser manages the Funds using a team of\ninvestment professionals. The team approach is\nused to create an environment that encourages\nthe flow of investment ideas. The portfolio\nmanagers within each team work together in a\ncohesive manner to develop and enhance\ntechniques that drive the investment process\nfor the respective investment strategy. This\napproach requires portfolio managers to share\na variety of responsibilities including\ninvestment strategy and analysis while\nretaining responsibility for the\nimplementation of the strategy within any\nparticular portfolio. The approach also\nenables the team to draw upon the resources of\nother groups within SSGA. Each portfolio\nmanagement team is overseen by the SSGA\nInvestment Committee.

The SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity\nIndex ETF's Index was created and sponsored by\nState Street Global Advisors (the \u201cIndex\nProvider\u201d or \u201cSSGA\u201d), an affiliate of the Fund\nand the Fund's Adviser. SSGA or one or more of\nits affiliates has entered into a license\nagreement with the Fund pursuant to which the\nFund uses the Index at no charge. The Index\nProvider establishes and maintains rules which\nare used to determine the composition of the\nIndex and relative weightings of the\nsecurities in the Index. In order to minimize\nany potential for conflicts caused by the fact\nthat SSGA acts as Index Provider and its\naffiliate acts as Advisor to the Fund, SSGA\nhas retained an unaffiliated third party 34\nTable of Contents to calculate the Index (the\n\u201cCalculation Agent\u201d). The Calculation Agent,\nusing the rules-based methodology, will\ncalculate, maintain and disseminate the Index\non a daily basis. SSGA will monitor the\nresults produced by the Calculation Agent to\nhelp ensure that the Index is being calculated\nin accordance with the rules-based\nmethodology. In addition, SSGA and the Adviser\nhave established policies and procedures\ndesigned to prevent non-public information\nabout pending changes to the Index from being\nused or disseminated in an improper manner.\nFurthermore, SSGA and the Adviser have\nestablished policies and procedures designed\nto prevent improper use and dissemination of\nnon-public information about the Fund's\nportfolio strategies. The Index Provider has\nno obligation to take the needs of the Fund or\nthe owners of Fund Shares into consideration\nin establishing and maintaining the Index.

The secondary markets\nare closed on weekends and also are generally\nclosed on the following holidays: New Year's\nDay, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Independence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The\nExchange may close early on the business day\nbefore certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules\nare subject to change without notice. If you\nbuy or sell Fund Shares in the secondary\nmarket, you will pay the secondary market\nprice for Fund Shares. In addition, you may\nincur customary brokerage commissions and\ncharges and may pay some or all of the spread\nbetween the bid and the offered price in the\nsecondary market on each leg of a round trip\n(purchase and sale) transaction. The trading\nprices of Fund Shares will fluctuate\ncontinuously throughout trading hours based on\nmarket supply and demand rather than the\nrelevant Fund's net asset value, which is\ncalculated at the end of each business day.\nFund Shares will trade on the Exchange at\nprices that may be above ( i.e., at a premium)\nor below ( i.e., at a discount), to varying\ndegrees, the daily net asset value of Fund\nShares. The trading prices of Fund Shares may\ndeviate significantly from the relevant Fund's\nnet asset value during periods of market\nvolatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares\ncan be issued and redeemed daily in Creation\nUnits, the Adviser believes that large\ndiscounts and premiums to net asset value\nshould not be sustained over long periods. The\nExchange will disseminate, every fifteen\nseconds during the regular trading day, an\nindicative optimized portfolio value (\u201cIOPV\u201d)\nrelating to each Fund. The IOPV calculations\nare estimates of the value of each Fund's net\nasset value per Fund Share. Premiums and\ndiscounts between the IOPV and the market\nprice may occur. This should not be viewed as\na \u201creal-time\u201d update of the net asset value\nper Fund Share. The IOPV is based on the\ncurrent market value of the published basket\nof portfolio securities and/or cash required\nto be deposited in exchange for a Creation\nUnit and does not necessarily reflect the\nprecise composition of a Fund's actual\nportfolio at a particular point in time.\nMoreover, the IOPV is generally determined by\nusing current market quotations and/or price\nquotations obtained from broker-dealers and\nother market intermediaries and valuations\nbased on current market rates. The IOPV may\nnot be calculated in the same manner as the\nNAV, which (i) is computed only once a day,\n(ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV, takes\ninto account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be\nsubject, in accordance with the requirements\nof the 1940 Act, to fair valuation at\ndifferent prices than those used in the\ncalculations of the IOPV. The IOPV price is\nbased on 35 Table of Contents quotes and\nclosing prices from the securities' local\nmarket converted into U.S. dollars at the\ncurrent currency rates and may not reflect\nevents that occur subsequent to the local\nmarket's close. Therefore, the IOPV may not\nreflect the best possible valuation of a\nFund's current portfolio. Neither the Funds\nnor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are\ninvolved in, or responsible for, the\ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and\nmake no warranty as to their accuracy. The\nFunds do not impose any restrictions on the\nfrequency of purchases and redemptions;\nhowever, the Funds reserve the right to reject\nor limit purchases at any time as described in\nthe SAI. When considering that no restriction\nor policy was necessary, the Board evaluated\nthe risks posed by market timing activities,\nsuch as whether frequent purchases and\nredemptions would interfere with the efficient\nimplementation of a Fund's investment\nstrategy, or whether they would cause a Fund\nto experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional\nmutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and\nredeemed only in large quantities of shares\nknown as Creation Units, available only from a\nFund directly, and that most trading in a Fund\noccurs on the Exchange at prevailing market\nprices and does not involve the Fund directly.\nGiven this structure, the Board determined\nthat it is unlikely that (a) market timing\nwould be attempted by a Fund's shareholders or\n(b) any attempts to market time a Fund by\nshareholders would result in negative impact\nto the Fund or its shareholders. Distributions\nDividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund\nshareholder, you are entitled to your share of\nthe applicable Fund's income and net realized\ngains on its investments. Each Fund pays out\nsubstantially all of its net earnings to its\nshareholders as \u201cdistributions.\u201d Each Fund may\nearn income dividends from stocks, interest\nfrom debt securities and, if participating,\nsecurities lending income. These amounts, net\nof expenses and taxes (if applicable), are\npassed along to Fund shareholders as \u201cincome\ndividend distributions.\u201d Each Fund will\ngenerally realize short-term capital gains or\nlosses whenever it sells or exchanges assets\nheld for one year or less. Net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be treated as\nordinary income when distributed to\nshareholders. Each Fund will generally realize\nlong-term capital gains or losses whenever it\nsells or exchanges assets held for more than\none year. Net capital gains (the excess of a\nFund's net long-term capital gains over its\nnet short-term capital losses) are distributed\nto shareholders as \u201ccapital gain\ndistributions.\u201d Income dividend distributions,\nif any, for the SPDR Bloomberg SASB Corporate\nBond ESG Select ETF are generally distributed\nto shareholders monthly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Income\ndividend distributions, if any, for the SPDR\nS&P 500 ESG ETF and SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity\nIndex ETF are generally distributed to\nshareholders quarterly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Net\ncapital gains for each Fund are distributed at\nleast annually. Dividends may be declared and\npaid more frequently or at any other time to\nimprove Index tracking or to comply with the\ndistribution requirements of the Code. A\nportion of each distribution may result in a\nreturn of capital. You will be notified\nregarding the portion of the distribution\nwhich represents a return of capital.\nDistributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares\nonly if the broker through whom you purchased\nFund Shares makes such option available.\nDistributions which are reinvested will\nnevertheless be taxable to the same extent as\nif such distributions had not been reinvested.\nPortfolio Holdings Disclosure The Funds'\nportfolio holdings disclosure policy is\ndescribed in the SAI. In addition, the\nidentities and quantities of the securities\nheld by each Fund are disclosed on the Funds'\nwebsite. Additional Tax Information The\nfollowing discussion is a summary of some\nimportant U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in a Fund. Your investment in a\nFund may have other tax implications. Please\nconsult your tax advisor about federal, state,\nlocal, foreign or other tax laws applicable to\nyou. Investors, including non-U.S. investors,\nmay wish to consult the SAI tax section for\nadditional disclosure. Taxes on Distributions.\nIn general, your distributions are subject to\nfederal income tax when they are paid, whether\nyou take them in cash or reinvest them in a\nFund. The income dividends and short-term\ncapital gains distributions you receive from a\nFund will be taxed as either ordinary income\nor qualified dividend income. Subject to\ncertain limitations, 36 Table of Contents\ndividends that are reported by a Fund as\nqualified dividend income are taxable to\nnoncorporate shareholders at reduced rates.\nAny distributions of a Fund's net capital\ngains are taxable as long-term capital gain\nregardless of how long you have owned Fund\nShares. Long-term capital gains are generally\ntaxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced\nrates. Distributions in excess of a Fund's\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits\nare treated as a tax-free return of capital to\nthe extent of your basis in the applicable\nFund's shares, and, in general, as capital\ngain thereafter. In general, dividends may be\nreported by a Fund as qualified dividend\nincome if they are attributable to qualified\ndividend income received by the Fund, which,\nin general, includes dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations and certain foreign\ncorporations ( i.e., certain foreign\ncorporations incorporated in a possession of\nthe United States or in certain countries with\na comprehensive tax treaty with the United\nStates, and certain other foreign corporations\nif the stock with respect to which the\ndividend is paid is readily tradable on an\nestablished securities market in the United\nStates), provided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period requirements in respect\nof the stock of such corporations and has not\nhedged its position in the stock in certain\nways. A dividend generally will not be treated\nas qualified dividend income if the dividend\nis received with respect to any share of stock\nheld by a Fund for fewer than 61 days during\nthe 121-day period beginning at the date which\nis 60 days before the date on which such share\nbecomes ex-dividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of certain preferred\nstock, for fewer than 91 days during the\n181-day period beginning 90 days before such\ndate. These holding period requirements will\nalso apply to your ownership of Fund Shares.\nHolding periods may be suspended for these\npurposes for stock that is hedged.\nAdditionally, income derived in connection\nwith a Fund's securities lending activities\nwill not be treated as qualified dividend\nincome. U.S. individuals with income exceeding\nspecified thresholds are subject to a 3.8%\nMedicare contribution tax on all or a portion\nof their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which\nincludes taxable interest, dividends and\ncertain capital gains (generally including\ncapital gain distributions and capital gains\nrealized upon the sale of Fund Shares). This\n3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of\nthe undistributed net investment income of\ncertain shareholders that are estates and\ntrusts. Certain tax-exempt educational\ninstitutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on\nnet investment income. For these purposes,\ncertain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the\ndisposition of Fund Shares (among other\ncategories of income), are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net\ninvestment income. If you lend your Fund\nShares pursuant to securities lending\narrangements you may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends (paid while the Fund Shares are\nheld by the borrower) as qualified dividend\nincome. You should consult your financial\nintermediary or tax advisor to discuss your\nparticular circumstances. Distributions paid\nin January, but declared by a Fund in October,\nNovember or December of the previous year,\npayable to shareholders of record in such a\nmonth, may be taxable to you in the calendar\nyear in which they were declared. The Funds\nwill inform you of the amount of your ordinary\nincome dividends, qualified dividend income\nand capital gain distributions shortly after\nthe close of each calendar year. A\ndistribution will reduce a Fund's net asset\nvalue per Fund Share and may be taxable to you\nas ordinary income or capital gain even\nthough, from an investment standpoint, the\ndistribution may constitute a return of\ncapital. Original Issue Discount . Investments\nby a Fund in zero coupon or other discount\nsecurities will result in income to the Fund\nequal to a portion of the excess face value of\nthe securities over their issue price (the\n\u201coriginal issue discount\u201d or \u201cOID\u201d) each year\nthat the securities are held, even though the\nFund may receive no cash interest payments or\nmay receive cash interest payments that are\nless than the income recognized for tax\npurposes. In other circumstances, whether\npursuant to the terms of a security or as a\nresult of other factors outside the control of\na Fund, a Fund may recognize income without\nreceiving a commensurate amount of cash. A\nFund\u2018s share of such income is included in\ndetermining the amount that the Fund must\ndistribute to maintain its eligibility for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand to avoid the payment of federal tax,\nincluding the nondeductible 4% excise tax.\nBecause any income required to be recognized\nas a result of the OID and/or market discount\nrules (discussed below) may not be matched by\na corresponding cash payment, a Fund may be\nrequired to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to\nits shareholders in order to qualify for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company\nand eliminate taxes at the Fund level. 37\nTable of Contents Inflation-Indexed Bonds.\nSpecial rules apply if a Fund holds inflation-\nindexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest\non inflation-indexed bonds is taken into\nincome by a Fund under its regular method of\naccounting for interest income. The amount of\nany positive inflation adjustment for a\ntaxable year, which results from an increase\nin the inflation-adjusted principal amount of\nthe bond, is treated as OID. The amount of a\nFund's OID in a taxable year with respect to a\nbond will increase the Fund's taxable income\nfor such year without a corresponding receipt\nof cash until the bond matures. As a result, a\nFund may need to use other sources of cash to\nsatisfy its distribution requirements for such\nyear. The amount of any negative inflation\nadjustments, which result from a decrease in\nthe inflation-adjusted principal amount of the\nbond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market\ndiscount, if any) otherwise includible in a\nFund's income with respect to the bond for the\ntaxable year; any remaining negative\nadjustments will be either treated as ordinary\nloss or, in certain circumstances, carried\nforward to reduce the amount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the\nbond in future taxable years. Market Discount.\nAny market discount recognized on a market\ndiscount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A\nmarket discount bond is a bond acquired in the\nsecondary market at a price below redemption\nvalue or below adjusted issue price if the\nbond was issued with original issue discount.\nAbsent an election by a Fund to include the\nmarket discount in income as it accrues, the\ngain on the Fund's disposition of such an\nobligation will be treated as ordinary income\nrather than capital gain to the extent of the\naccrued market discount. Where the income\nrequired to be recognized as a result of the\nmarket discount rules is not matched by a\ncorresponding cash receipt by a Fund, the Fund\nmay be required to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to enable the Fund to make\ndistributions to its shareholders in order to\nqualify for treatment as a regulated\ninvestment company and eliminate taxes at the\nFund level, potentially resulting in\nadditional taxable gain or loss to the Fund.\nDerivatives and Other Complex Securities. A\nFund may invest in complex securities. These\ninvestments may be subject to numerous special\nand complex rules. These rules could affect\nwhether gains and losses recognized by a Fund\nare treated as ordinary income or capital\ngain, accelerate the recognition of income to\na Fund and/or defer a Fund's ability to\nrecognize losses. In turn, these rules may\naffect the amount, timing or character of the\nincome distributed to you by a Fund. You\nshould consult your personal tax advisor\nregarding the application of these rules.\nForeign Currency Transactions. A Fund's\ntransactions in foreign currencies, foreign\ncurrency denominated debt obligations and\ncertain foreign currency options, futures\ncontracts and forward contracts (and similar\ninstruments) may give rise to ordinary income\nor loss to the extent such income or loss\nresults from fluctuations in the value of the\nforeign currency concerned. Taxes on Exchange-\nListed Share Sales. Any capital gain or loss\nrealized upon a sale of Fund Shares is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if Fund Shares have been held for more\nthan one year and as short-term capital gain\nor loss if Fund Shares have been held for one\nyear or less, except that any capital loss on\nthe sale of Fund Shares held for six months or\nless will be disallowed to the extent of\nexempt-interest dividends received with\nrespect to those Fund Shares, and to the\nextent not disallowed will be treated as long-\nterm capital loss to the extent that capital\ngain dividends were paid with respect to the\nFund Shares. Taxes on Creations and\nRedemptions of Creation Units. A person who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units\ngenerally will recognize a gain or loss. The\ngain or loss will be equal to the difference\nbetween the market value of the Creation Units\nat the time and the exchanger's aggregate\nbasis in the securities surrendered plus any\ncash paid for the Creation Units. A person who\nexchanges Creation Units for securities will\ngenerally recognize a gain or loss equal to\nthe difference between the exchanger's basis\nin the Creation Units and the aggregate market\nvalue of the securities and the amount of cash\nreceived. The Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d), however, may assert that a loss\nrealized upon an exchange of securities for\nCreation Units cannot be deducted currently\nunder the rules governing \u201cwash sales,\u201d or on\nthe basis that there has been no significant\nchange in economic position. Persons\nexchanging securities should consult their own\ntax advisor with respect to whether wash sale\nrules apply and when a loss might be\ndeductible. Under current federal tax laws,\nany capital gain or loss realized upon a\nredemption (or creation) of Creation Units is\ngenerally treated as long-term capital gain or\nloss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for\nmore than one year and as a short-term capital\ngain or loss if the applicable Fund Shares (or\nsecurities surrendered) have been held for one\nyear or less. 38 Table of Contents If you\ncreate or redeem Creation Units, you will be\nsent a confirmation statement showing how many\nFund Shares you purchased or sold and at what\nprice. The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has\nthe right to reject an order for Creation\nUnits if the purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund\nShares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund and\nif, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the\napplicable Fund would have a basis in the\nsecurities different from the market value of\nthe securities on the date of deposit. The\nTrust also has the right to require\ninformation necessary to determine beneficial\nshare ownership for purposes of the 80%\ndetermination. If the Trust does issue\nCreation Units to a purchaser (or a group of\npurchasers) that would, upon obtaining the\nFund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the applicable Fund, the\npurchaser (or group of purchasers) will not\nrecognize gain or loss upon the exchange of\nsecurities for Creation Units. If a Fund\nredeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear\nadditional costs and recognize more capital\ngains than it would if it redeems Creation\nUnits in-kind. Non-U.S. Investors. Ordinary\nincome dividends paid by a Fund to\nshareholders who are non-resident aliens or\nforeign entities will generally be subject to\na 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than\ndistributions reported by the Fund as\ninterest-related dividends and short-term\ncapital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty\nrate applies or unless such income is\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or\nbusiness. In general, a Fund may report\ninterest-related dividends to the extent of\nits net income derived from U.S. source\ninterest, and a Fund may report short-term\ncapital gain dividends to the extent its net\nshort-term capital gain for the taxable year\nexceeds its net long-term capital loss. Gains\non the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that\nare, in each case, effectively connected with\nthe conduct of a trade or business within the\nU.S. will generally be subject to U.S. federal\nnet income taxation at regular income tax\nrates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 5% of a\nFund's shares are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning special tax rules that\nmay apply to their investment. Unless certain\nnon-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply\nwith IRS requirements that will generally\nrequire them to report information regarding\nU.S. persons investing in, or holding accounts\nwith, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may\napply to distributions payable to such\nentities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt\nfrom the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement between the U.S.\nand a foreign government, provided that the\nshareholder and the applicable foreign\ngovernment comply with the terms of such\nagreement. Backup Withholding. A Fund will be\nrequired in certain cases to withhold (as\n\u201cbackup withholding\u201d) on amounts payable to\nany shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund\neither an incorrect tax identification number\nor no number at all, (2) is subject to backup\nwithholding by the IRS for failure to properly\nreport payments of interest or dividends, (3)\nhas failed to certify to the Fund that such\nshareholder is not subject to backup\nwithholding, or (4) has not certified that\nsuch shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding\nrate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will\nnot be applied to payments that have been\nsubject to the 30% withholding tax on\nshareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States.\nOther Tax Issues. A Fund may be subject to tax\nin certain states where the Fund does business\n(or is treated as doing business as a result\nof its investments). Furthermore, in those\nstates which have income tax laws, the tax\ntreatment of the Funds and of Fund\nshareholders with respect to distributions by\nthe Funds may differ from federal tax\ntreatment. The foregoing discussion summarizes\nsome of the consequences under current federal\nincome tax law of an investment in the Funds.\nIt is not a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. Consult your personal tax advisor\nabout the potential tax consequences of an\ninvestment in the Funds under all applicable\ntax laws. General Information The Trust was\norganized as a Massachusetts business trust on\nJune 12, 1998. If shareholders of any Fund are\nrequired to vote on any matters, shareholders\nare entitled to one vote for each Fund Share\nthey own. Annual meetings of shareholders will\nnot be held except as required by the 1940 Act\nand other applicable law. See the SAI for more\ninformation concerning the Trust's form of\norganization. Management and Organization Each\nFund is a separate series of the Trust, which\nis an open-end registered management\ninvestment company. 39 Table of Contents For\npurposes of the 1940 Act, Fund Shares are\nissued by the respective series of the Trust\nand the acquisition of Fund Shares by\ninvestment companies is subject to the\nrestrictions of Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940\nAct. The Trust has received exemptive relief\nfrom Section 12(d)(1) to allow registered\ninvestment companies to invest in the Funds\nbeyond the limits set forth in Section\n12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and\nconditions as set forth in an SEC exemptive\norder issued to the Trust, including that such\ninvestment companies enter into an agreement\nwith the Trust. This order will be rescinded\nby the SEC on January 19, 2022. However,\neffective January 19, 2021, new Rule 12d1-4\npermits other investment companies to invest\nin the Funds beyond the limits in Section\n12(d)(1), subject to similar conditions. From\ntime to time, a Fund may advertise yield and\ntotal return figures. Yield is a historical\nmeasure of dividend income, and total return\nis a measure of past dividend income (assuming\nthat it has been reinvested) plus capital\nappreciation. Neither yield nor total return\nshould be used to predict the future\nperformance of a Fund. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius\nLLP serves as counsel to the Trust, including\nthe Funds. Ernst & Young LLP serves as the\nindependent registered public accounting firm\nand will audit the Funds' financial statements\nannually. Financial Highlights These financial\nhighlight tables are intended to help you\nunderstand each Fund's financial performance\nfor the past five fiscal years, or, if\nshorter, the period since a Fund's inception.\nCertain information reflects the performance\nresults for a single Fund Share. The total\nreturns in the table represent the rate that\nan investor would have earned (or lost) on an\ninvestment in each Fund (assuming reinvestment\nof all dividends and distributions). This\ninformation has been audited by Ernst & Young\nLLP, the Trust's independent registered public\naccounting firm, whose report, along with each\nFund's financial highlights and financial\nstatements, is included in the annual report\nto shareholders, which is available upon\nrequest. Any references to Notes in these\nfinancial highlight tables refer to the \u201cNotes\nto Financial Statements\u201d section of each\nFund's financial statements, and the financial\ninformation included in these tables should be\nread in conjunction with the financial\nstatements incorporated by reference in the\nSAI. 40\n\nTable of Contents SPDR SERIES TRUST FINANCIAL\nHIGHLIGHTS Selected data for a share\noutstanding throughout each period\n                                              \n                         SPDR Bloomberg SASB  \n                          Corporate Bond ESG  \n                                  Select ETF  \n                                     For the  \n                                      Period  \n                                  11/09/20*-  \n                                     6/30/21  \n  Net asset value,                    $25.00  \n  beginning of period                         \n  Income (loss) from                          \n  investment                                  \n  operations:                                 \n  Net investment                        0.30  \n  income (loss) (a)                           \n  Net realized and                            \n  unrealized gain                      -0.11  \n  (loss) (b)                                  \n  Total from                                  \n  investment                            0.19  \n  operations                                  \n  Net equalization                            \n  credits and charges                0.00(c)  \n  (a)                                         \n  Other capital (a)                  0.00(c)  \n  Distributions to                            \n  shareholders from:                          \n  Net investment                       -0.27  \n  income                                      \n  Net asset value,                    $24.92  \n  end of period                               \n  Total return (d)                     0.78%  \n  Ratios and                                  \n  Supplemental Data:                          \n  Net assets, end of                 $29,910  \n  period (in 000s)                            \n  Ratios to average                           \n  net assets:                                 \n  Total expenses                    0.12%(e)  \n  Net investment                    1.85%(e)  \n  income (loss)                               \n  Portfolio turnover                  16%(g)  \n  rate (f)                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  *    Commencement of operations.            \n       Per share numbers have been            \n       calculated using average shares        \n  (a)  outstanding, which more appropriately  \n       presents the per share data for the    \n       year.                                  \n       Amounts shown in this caption for a    \n       share outstanding may not accord with  \n       the change in aggregate gains and      \n  (b)  losses in securities for the fiscal    \n       period because of the timing of sales  \n       and repurchases of Fund shares in      \n       relation to fluctuating market values  \n       for the Fund.                          \n  (c)  Amount is less than $0.005 per share.  \n       Total return is calculated assuming a  \n       purchase of shares at net asset value  \n       on the first day and a sale at net     \n       asset value on the last day of each    \n       period reported.
