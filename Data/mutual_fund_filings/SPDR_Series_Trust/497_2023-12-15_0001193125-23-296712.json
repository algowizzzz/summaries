  "text": "SPDR \u00aeSERIES TRUST SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) Supplement dated December 15, 2023to the\nProspectus and Summary Prospectus, each dated October 31, 2023, as may be supplemented from time to time\nEffective after the close of trading on December 15, 2023 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), changes were made to the\nmethodology for the Fund\u2019s underlying index, the S&P Kensho Smart Transportation Index. As a result, as of\nthe Effective Date, \u201c THE FUND \u2019 S PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY \u201d section in the Prospectus and Summary\nProspectus is replaced in its entirety with the following: In seeking to track the performance of the S&P\nKensho Smart Transportation Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the\nFund is not required to purchase all of the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may\npurchase a subset of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return characteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will\nbe based on a number of factors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these factors,\nSSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\u201cSSGA FM\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may\ninvest the Fund\u2019s assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund\u2019s assets in\nsubstantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the\nIndex, as determined by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its objective. Under\nnormal market conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total\nassets in the securities comprising the Index. In addition, in seeking to track the Index, the Fund may\ninvest in equity securities that are not included in the Index, cash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments, such as repurchase agreements and money market funds (including money market funds advised by\nthe Adviser). In seeking to track the Index, the Fund\u2019s assets may be concentrated in an industry or group\nof industries, but only to the extent that the Index concentrates in a particular industry or group of\nindustries. Futures contracts (a type of derivative instrument) may be used by the Fund in seeking\nperformance that corresponds to the Index and in managing cash flows. The Index is comprised of U.S.-listed\nequity securities (including depositary receipts) of companies domiciled across developed and emerging\nmarkets worldwide which are included in the Smart Transportation sector as determined by a classification\nstandard produced by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Provider\u201d). The Index is designed to capture\ncompanies whose products and services are driving innovation behind smart transportation. In particular, the\nIndex comprises the components of the S&P Kensho Autonomous Vehicles Index, the S&P Kensho Advanced\nTransport Systems Index, the S&P Kensho Electric\n\nVehicles Index and the civilian/commercially focused components of the S&P Kensho Drones Index (the\n\u201cUnderlying Indexes\u201d) as of the Index\u2019s reconstitution reference date. The Underlying Indexes are subject to\nthe following liquidity thresholds for each component: (i) must have a share price of at least USD $1.00;\n(ii) must be issued by a company with a minimum float market capitalization of at least $100 million; and\n(iii) must have a minimum three-month average daily traded value of at least $1 million. The S&P Kensho\nAutonomous Vehicles Index seeks to track companies that build autonomous and connected vehicles and that\nprovide the products and services that enable these vehicles to become more efficient and intelligent, or\nare a necessary component of the supply chain for such products and services. The S&P Kensho Advanced\nTransport Systems Index seeks to track companies that produce products and services that optimize the\nefficiency of managing large fleets of vehicles, cargo transportation, and mass transit, or are a necessary\ncomponent of the supply chain for such products and services. The S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles Index seeks\nto track companies that produce products and services related to the development of electric vehicles, clean\nfuel systems, and related systems, or are a necessary component of the supply chain for such products and\nservices. The S&P Kensho Drones Index seeks to track companies that produce products and services related to\nthe remotely-operated or unmanned aerial, underwater and surface-level drones market and related subsystems,\nor are a necessary component of the supply chain for such products and services. To determine the\nconstituents of the Underlying Indexes, the Index Provider\u2019s classification standard utilizes an automated\nscan of companies\u2019 most recent regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Form\n10\u2011K, Form 20\u2011F, Form 40\u2011F, or Form S\u20111, as applicable, maintained in the S&P Market Intelligence United\nDocument Repository, to identify specific search terms and phrases that describe a company as producing\nproducts and services related to the particular segment targeted by the Underlying Index. The resulting list\nof eligible securities for each Underlying Index is then filtered by eliminating companies that do not\ninclude in their regulatory filings a reference to a product or service that (i) is related to a search term\nor phrase and (ii) is used in a manner that is within the scope of the Underlying Index\u2019s objective. Each\nUnderlying Index then screens the remaining securities to remove securities that are not listed on NYSE,\nNASDAQ, or CBOE exchanges (or an affiliate of one of those exchanges) or do not meet certain minimum\nliquidity thresholds. The Index Provider\u2019s Index Committee then reviews each remaining eligible constituent\nto verify the rules of the automated scan were implemented correctly. Underlying Index constituents are then\ncategorized as either \u201cCore\u201d or \u201cNon\u2011Core.\u201d A company is categorized as Core if its products and services\nrelated to the Underlying Index\u2019s objective are identified in its regulatory filings as principal components\nof the company\u2019s strategy. Products and services are deemed to be principal components of a company\u2019s\nstrategy if the company\u2019s regulatory filing disclosures regarding such products and services are determined\nto\n\nbe sufficiently prominent according to a proprietary algorithm of the Index Provider which calculates\nprominence based on the frequency and position of such disclosures within regulatory filings. A company may\nalso be categorized as Core if the Index Provider determines that the majority of the company\u2019s revenue is\nderived from products and services related to the Underlying Index\u2019s objective as indicated by the company\u2019s\nreported business segments, which is assessed by scanning the S&P Capital IQ Database for annual fiscal year\nrevenue segment reporting. All other companies are categorized as Non\u2011Core, including companies whose\nproducts and services are identified as forming a necessary component of the supply chain of the segment\ntargeted by the Underlying Index. An Index constituent categorized as Core by at least one of the Underlying\nIndexes will be categorized as Core for purposes of the Index. To tilt the Index\u2019s exposure toward Core\nIndex Constituents, at the time of each rebalance the aggregate weighting of Core Index Constituents is\nbased on the proportion of the number of Core Index Constituents, plus an overweight factor of up to 20%. At\nthe time of each rebalance, each Core Index Constituent and Non\u2011Core Index Constituent is equally weighted\nwithin the group of Core Index Constituents and Non\u2011Core Index Constituents, respectively, subject to\nliquidity adjustments. The Index is reconstituted and rebalanced after the close of trading on the third\nFriday in June with a reference date as of the close of the last trading day in May. In addition, the Index\nis rebalanced after the close of trading on the third Friday of December with a reference date as of the\nclose of the last trading day in November. In connection with the December rebalance, Index constituents are\nalso evaluated for continued inclusion in the Index if a new eligible regulatory filing has been filed since\nthe last reconstitution review. As of December 15, 2023, the Index comprised 80 securities. The Index\nProvider is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider establishes and maintains rules\nwhich are used to determine the composition of the Index and relative weightings of the securities in the\nIndex.\n                             PLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE                             \n                                                                                                 121523SUPP1\n"
