Instead, the Fund may purchase a\nsubset of the securities in the Index in an\neffort to hold a portfolio of securities with\ngenerally the same risk and return\ncharacteristics of the Index.

In addition, in seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund may invest in debt\nsecurities that are not included in the Index,\ncash and cash equivalents or money market\ninstruments, such as repurchase agreements and\nmoney market funds (including money market\nfunds advised by the Adviser). In seeking to\ntrack the Index, the Fund\u2019s assets may be\nconcentrated in an industry or group of\nindustries, but only to the extent that the\nIndex concentrates in a particular industry or\ngroup of industries. The Fund may also enter\ninto forward currency exchange contracts for\nhedging and/or investment purposes.
