  "text": "SPDR \u00aeSERIES TRUST SPDR S&P Transportation ETF\nSupplement dated March 17, 2023to the\nProspectus and Summary Prospectus, each dated\nOctober 31, 2022, as may be supplemented from\ntime to time Effective after the close of\nbusiness on March 17, 2023, the third\nparagraph in \u201cThe Fund\u2019s Principal Investment\nStrategy\u201d section beginning on page 261 of the\nProspectus and beginning on page 1 of the\nSummary Prospectus is deleted and replaced\nwith the paragraph below. These updates are in\nconnection with changes to the Global Industry\nClassification Standard (GICS) structure, also\neffective after the close of business on March\n17, 2023. The Index represents the\ntransportation segment of the S&P Total Market\nIndex (\u201cS&P TMI\u201d). The S&P TMI is designed to\ntrack the broad U.S. equity market. The\ntransportation segment of the S&P TMI\ncomprises the following sub\u2011industries: Air\nFreight & Logistics, Airport Services, Cargo\nGround Transportation, Highways & Rail Tracks,\nMarine Transportation, Marine Ports &\nServices, Passenger Airlines, Passenger Ground\nTransportation, and Rail Transportation. The\nIndex is one of twenty\u2011one (21) of the S&P\nSelect Industry Indices (the \u201cSelect Industry\nIndices\u201d), each designed to measure the\nperformance of a narrow sub\u2011industry or group\nof sub\u2011industries determined based on the\nGlobal Industry Classification Standard\n(\u201cGICS\u201d). Membership in the Select Industry\nIndices is based on the GICS classification,\nas well as liquidity and market cap\nrequirements. Companies in the Select Industry\nIndices are classified according to GICS which\ndetermines classifications primarily based on\nrevenues; however, earnings and market\nperception are also considered. The Index\nconsists of the S&P TMI constituents belonging\nto the Air Freight & Logistics, Airport\nServices, Cargo Ground Transportation,\nHighways & Rail Tracks, Marine Transportation,\nMarine Ports & Services, Passenger Airlines,\nPassenger Ground Transportation, and Rail\nTransportation sub\u2011industries that satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (i) have a float-adjusted\nmarket capitalization greater than or equal to\n$500 million with a float-adjusted liquidity\nratio (defined by dollar value traded over the\nprevious 12 months divided by the float-\nadjusted market capitalization as of the index\nrebalancing reference date) greater than or\nequal to 90% or have a float-adjusted market\ncapitalization greater than or equal to $400\nmillion with a float-adjusted liquidity ratio\n(as defined above) greater than or equal to\n150%; and (ii) are U.S. based companies. To\nevaluate liquidity, the dollar value traded\nfor initial public offerings or spin-offs that\ndo not have 12 months of trading history is\nannualized. The market capitalization\nthreshold may be relaxed to ensure that there\nare at least 22 stocks in the Index as of the\nrebalancing effective date. Existing Index\nconstituents are removed at the quarterly\nrebalancing effective date if either their\nfloat-adjusted market capitalization falls\nbelow $300 million or their float-adjusted\nliquidity ratio falls below 50%. The market\ncapitalization threshold and the liquidity\nthreshold are each reviewed from time to time\nbased on market conditions. The Index\nrebalances and reconstitutes quarterly on the\nthird Friday of the quarter ending month. The\nreference date for additions and deletions is\nafter the close of the last trading date of\nthe previous month. The S&P TMI tracks all\neligible U.S. common equities listed on the\nNYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NASDAQ Global\nSelect Market, NASDAQ Select Market, NASDAQ\nCapital Market, Cboe BZX, Cboe BYX, Cboe EDGA,\nor Cboe EDGX exchanges. The Index is modified\nequal weighted.
