You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions\nand other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and Example below. Annual\nFund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\n                                                \n  Management fees                        0.03%  \n  Distribution and service (12b-1) fees  None   \n  Other expenses1                        0.00%  \n  Total annual Fund operating expenses   0.03%  \n                                                \n1 \u201cOther expenses\u201d are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year. Example: This Example is\nintended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds.\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated, and then sell or\nhold all of your Fund Shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has\na 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may\nbe higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n                  \n  Year 1  Year 3  \n  $3         $10  \n                  \nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities\n(or \u201c turns over \u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not\nreflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. The Fund had\nnot commenced operations as of the date of this Prospectus and, as a result, does not yet have a portfolio\nturnover rate. The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy In seeking to track the performance of the Bloomberg\nU.S. Treasury Index (the \u201c Index \u201d ), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not\nrequired to purchase all of the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset\nof the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the same risk\nand return characteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number of\nfactors, including asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management,\nInc. ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the \u201c Adviser \u201d ), the investment adviser to the Fund, either may invest the Fund's\nassets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the\nsecurities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the Index, as determined by the\nAdviser to be in the best interest of the Fund in pursuing its objective. Under normal market conditions,\nthe Fund generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities\ncomprising the Index and in securities that the Adviser determines have economic characteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the economic characteristics of the securities that comprise the Index. In\naddition, in seeking\n\n1\n\nto track the Index, the Fund may invest in debt securities that are not included in the Index. The Fund may\nalso invest in cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments (including money market funds advised\nby the Adviser) for cash management purposes. The Index is designed to measure the performance of public\nobligations of the U.S. Treasury. The Index includes all publicly issued U.S. Treasury securities that have\na remaining maturity of greater than or equal to 1 year, are rated investment grade and have $300 million or\nmore of outstanding face value. In addition, the securities must be denominated in U.S. dollars, fixed rate\nand non-convertible. Securities excluded from the Index include state and local government series bonds,\ninflation protected public obligations of the U.S. Treasury, commonly known as \u201c TIPS, \u201d floating rate\nbonds, and coupon issues that have been stripped from bonds included in the Index. The Index is market\ncapitalization weighted and the securities in the Index are reconstituted and rebalanced on the last\nbusiness day of each month. As of April 30, 2024, there were 286 securities in the Index and the dollar-\nweighted average maturity of the securities in the Index was 5.83 years. The Index is sponsored by Bloomberg\nIndex Services Limited (the \u201c Index Provider \u201d ), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The\nIndex Provider determines the composition of the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the Index\nand publishes information regarding the market value of the Index. Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund\nAs with all investments, there are certain risks of investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value,\nand you could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Market Risk: The Fund's\ninvestments are subject to changes in general economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks\ninherent in investment in securities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments\ncan change substantially due to various factors including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession,\nchanges in interest rates, inflation, changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and\ngeneral market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities\nmarkets and adversely affect global economies and markets. Local, regional or global events such as war,\nmilitary conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or other public\nhealth issues, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments. Debt\nSecurities Risk: The values of debt securities may increase or decrease as a result of the following: market\nfluctuations, changes in interest rates, actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers,\nguarantors or liquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments, or illiquidity in debt\nsecurities markets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's fixed income securities to decrease, an\nadverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income securities, and increased volatility of the fixed\nincome markets. During periods when interest rates are at low levels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the\nFund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on an operating basis). To the extent that interest\nrates fall, certain underlying obligations may be paid off substantially faster than originally anticipated.\nIf the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before expected, the prepayments of principal may have to\nbe reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates. During periods of falling interest rates, the\nincome received by the Fund may decline. Changes in interest rates will likely have a greater effect on the\nvalues of debt securities of longer durations. Returns on investments in debt securities could trail the\nreturns on other investment options, including investments in equity securities. U.S. Treasury Obligations\nRisk: U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other fixed income securities in their interest rates,\nmaturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial\ncondition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury\nobligations to decline. Fluctuation of Net Asset Value, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk: As with all\nexchange-traded funds, Fund Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at market prices. The\ntrading prices of Fund Shares in the secondary market may differ from the Fund's daily net asset value per\nshare and there may be times when the market price of the shares is more than the net asset value per share\n(premium) or less than the net asset value per share (discount). This risk is heightened in times of market\nvolatility or periods of steep market declines. 2 Income Risk: The Fund's income may decline due to falling\ninterest rates or other factors. Issuers of securities held by the Fund may call or redeem the securities\nduring periods of falling interest rates, and the Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities\npaying lower interest rates. If an obligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the\nprepayment in other obligations paying income at lower rates. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk: The\nFund is managed with an indexing investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged\nindex of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of the actual\nsecurities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to\noutperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less favorable than that of a\nportfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The structure and composition of the Index will\naffect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the performance, volatility,\nand risk of the Fund. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Index in\naccordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the\nIndex Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its\nshareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in between reconstitutions, the Index may include, and the\nFund may therefore hold for a period of time, securities of companies that do not align with the Index's\nobjective and/or criteria. When there are changes made to the component securities of the Index and the Fund\nin turn makes similar changes to its portfolio, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such\nportfolio changes will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. The Fund may recognize gains as a\nresult of rebalancing or reconstituting its securities holdings to reflect changes in the securities\nincluded in the Index. The Fund also may be required to distribute any such gains to its shareholders to\navoid adverse federal income tax consequences. While the Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index\n( i.e. , achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Fund's return may not match the return of\nthe Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in\nbuying and selling securities. In addition, the Fund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a\nresult of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The\nAdviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the Index,\nor in some securities not included in the Index, potentially increasing the risk of divergence between the\nFund's return and that of the Index. Liquidity Risk: Lack of a ready market, stressed market conditions, or\nrestrictions on resale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or price\nor at all. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in market value. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may\nlead to differences between the market price of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund Shares, and\ncould result in the Fund Shares being less liquid. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may also limit the\nability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to\nlimitations on investments in any illiquid investments and/or the difficulty in purchasing and selling such\ninvestments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain market or sector. New Fund\nRisk: The Fund is new and there is no assurance that the Fund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size is\nsmall, the Fund may experience low trading volume, which could lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition,\nthe Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing\nexchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause elevated transaction costs for the Fund and\nnegative tax consequences for its shareholders. Securities Lending Risk: The Fund may engage in securities\nlending. Securities lending involves the risk that the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money due to a decline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned securities or any investments made with cash collateral. These events could\nalso trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. To the extent the collateral provided or investments\nmade with cash collateral differ from securities included in the Index, such collateral or investments may\nhave a greater risk of loss than the securities included in the Index. Valuation Risk: Some portfolio\nholdings, potentially a large portion of the Fund's investment portfolio, may be valued on the basis of\nfactors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced\nliquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market quotations\nare not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ\nfrom what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations.\nPortfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including \u201c fair valued \u201d\nsecurities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if\nmarket quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out a\nportfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would\nincur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established\nby the Fund at that time. 3 Fund Performance The Fund had not commenced operations as of the date of this\nProspectus.Once the Fund has completed a full calendar year of operations, a bar chart and table will be\nincluded that will provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing the variability\nof the Fund's returns based on net assets and comparing the Fund's performance to the Index. When available,\nupdated performance information may be obtained by calling 1-866-787-2257 or visiting the Fund's website:\nhttps://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Portfolio Management Investment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment\nadviser to the Fund. Portfolio Managers The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund are Joanna Madden and Cynthia Moy. Joanna Madden is a Vice President of the Adviser\nand a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She joined the Adviser in 2003. Cynthia\nMoy is a Principal of the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta Solutions Group. She\njoined the Adviser in 2007. Purchase and Sale Information The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to\ncertain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of\nFund Shares known as \u201c Creation Units. \u201d Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the\ndeposit or delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash. Individual Fund Shares may\nonly be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the \u201c Exchange \u201d ), other national securities exchanges,\nelectronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market\nprices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value ( \u201c NAV \u201d ), Fund Shares\nmay trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund\nShares in the secondary market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price\na buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept\nfor Fund Shares (ask) (the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Recent information regarding the Fund's NAV, market price,\npremiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs . Tax Information The\nFund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any\nwithdrawals made from a tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable to you. Payments to Broker-Dealers and\nOther Financial Intermediaries If you purchase Fund Shares through a broker-dealer or other financial\nintermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the financial intermediary for certain\nactivities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund.\nThese payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and\nyour salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial\nintermediary's website for more information. 4 Additional Strategies Information Principal Strategies\nGeneral . Please see \u201c The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy \u201d section under \u201c Fund Summary \u201d above for a\ndiscussion of the Fund's principal investment strategy. The Fund may invest in various types of securities\nand engage in various investment techniques which are not the principal focus of the Fund and therefore are\nnot described in this Prospectus. These securities, techniques and practices, together with their risks, are\ndescribed in the Statement of Additional Information (the \u201c SAI \u201d ), which you may obtain free of charge by\ncontacting shareholder services (see the back cover of this Prospectus for the address and phone number).\nThe Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Fund's Index as closely as possible (i.e ., obtain a high\ndegree of correlation with the Index). A number of factors may affect the Fund's ability to achieve a high\ndegree of correlation with its Index, and there can be no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree\nof correlation. For example, the Fund may not be able to achieve a high degree of correlation with its Index\nwhen there are practical difficulties or substantial costs involved in compiling a portfolio of securities\nto follow the Index, when a security in the Index becomes temporarily illiquid, unavailable or less liquid,\nor legal restrictions exist that prohibit the Fund from investing in a security in the Index. The Adviser\nwill utilize a sampling strategy in managing the Fund. Sampling means that the Adviser uses quantitative\nanalysis to select securities, including securities in the Index, outside of the Index and derivatives that\nhave a similar investment profile as the Index in terms of key risk factors, performance attributes and\nother economic characteristics. These include industry weightings, market capitalization, and other\nfinancial characteristics of securities. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number of\nfactors, including asset size of the Fund. In addition, from time to time, securities are added to or\nremoved from the Index. The Adviser may sell securities that are represented in the Index, or purchase\nsecurities that are not yet represented in the Index, in anticipation of their removal from or addition to\nthe Index. Further, the Adviser may choose to overweight securities in the Index, purchase or sell\nsecurities not in the Index, or utilize various combinations of other available techniques, in seeking to\ntrack the Index. The Fund, as described in the SAI, has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy to\ninvest at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of borrowings for investment purposes, in investments\nsuggested by its name, measured at the time of investment. The Fund will provide shareholders with at least\n60 days' notice prior to any change in this non-fundamental 80% investment policy. The Board of Trustees of\nthe Trust (the \u201c Board \u201d ) may change the Fund's investment strategy, Index and other policies without\nshareholder approval, except as otherwise indicated in this Prospectus or in the SAI. The Board may also\nchange the Fund's investment objective without shareholder approval. Non-Principal Strategies Certain Other\nInvestments . The Fund may invest in structured notes (notes on which the amount of principal repayment and\ninterest payments are based on the movement of one or more specified factors such as the movement of a\nparticular security or index), swaps, options and futures contracts. Swaps, options, futures contracts and\nstructured notes may be used by the Fund in seeking performance that corresponds to its Index and in\nmanaging cash flows. Temporary Defensive Positions . In certain situations or market conditions, the Fund\nmay temporarily depart from its normal investment policies and strategies, provided that the alternative is\nconsistent with the Fund's investment objective and is in the best interest of the Fund. For example, the\nFund may make larger than normal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure to its Index if it is\nunable to invest directly in a component security. Borrowing Money . The Fund may borrow money from a bank\nas permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ( \u201c 1940 Act \u201d ), or other governing statute,\nby the rules thereunder, or by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( \u201c SEC \u201d ) or other regulatory\nagency with authority over the Fund, but only for temporary or emergency purposes. The 1940 Act presently\nallows the Fund to borrow from any bank (including pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an\namount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets (not including temporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of its\ntotal assets). The Fund may also invest in reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions.\nConsistent with a rule under the 1940 Act, the Fund may treat such investments as either borrowings or\nderivatives transactions. To the extent the Fund treats reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing\ntransactions 5 as borrowings, such investments will also be included in the 33 1/3% limit. Under normal\ncircumstances, any borrowings by the Fund (including investments in reverse repurchase agreements or similar\nfinancing transactions treated as borrowings) will not exceed 10% of the Fund's total assets. Lending of\nSecurities . The Fund may lend its portfolio securities in an amount not to exceed 40% of the value of its\nnet assets via a securities lending program through its securities lending agent, State Street Bank and\nTrust Company ( \u201c State Street \u201d or the \u201c Lending Agent \u201d ), to brokers, dealers and other financial\ninstitutions desiring to borrow securities to complete transactions and for other purposes. A securities\nlending program allows the Fund to receive a portion of the income generated by lending its securities and\ninvesting the respective collateral. The Fund will receive collateral for each loaned security which is at\nleast equal to the market value of that security, marked to market each trading day. To the extent the Fund\nreceives cash collateral, as of the date of this Prospectus, the Adviser expects to invest such cash\ncollateral in a fund managed by the Adviser that invests in: a broad range of money market instruments;\ncertificates of deposit and time deposits of U.S. and foreign banks; commercial paper and other high quality\nobligations of U.S. or foreign companies; asset-backed securities; mortgage-related securities; repurchase\nagreements; and shares of money market funds. With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the\nborrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by\nthe difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the\nborrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, the Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower\nequal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. In the securities lending program, the\nborrower generally has the right to vote the loaned securities; however, the Fund may call loans to vote\nproxies if a material issue affecting the Fund's economic interest in the investment is to be voted upon.\nSecurity loans may be terminated at any time by the Fund. Additional Risk Information The following section\nprovides information regarding the principal risks identified under \u201c Principal Risks of Investing in the\nFund \u201d in the Fund Summary along with additional risk information. Principal Risks Debt Securities Risk .\nThe values of debt securities may increase or decrease as a result of the following: market fluctuations,\nchanges in interest rates, actual or perceived inability or unwillingness of issuers, guarantors or\nliquidity providers to make scheduled principal or interest payments or illiquidity in debt securities\nmarkets. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply. A\nrising interest rate environment may cause the value of the Fund's fixed income securities to decrease, a\ndecline in the Fund's income and yield, an adverse impact on the liquidity of the Fund's fixed income\nsecurities, and increased volatility of the fixed income markets. During periods when interest rates are at\nlow levels, the Fund's yield can be low, and the Fund may have a negative yield (i.e., it may lose money on\nan operating basis). To the extent that interest rates fall, certain underlying obligations may be paid off\nsubstantially faster than originally anticipated. If the principal on a debt obligation is prepaid before\nexpected, the prepayments of principal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower\nrates. During periods of falling interest rates, the income received by the Fund may decline. Changes in\ninterest rates will likely have a greater effect on the values of debt securities of longer durations.\nReturns on investments in debt securities could trail the returns on other investment options, including\ninvestments in equity securities. High levels of inflation and/or a significantly changing interest rate\nenvironment can lead to heightened levels of volatility and reduced liquidity. Fluctuation of Net Asset\nValue, Share Premiums and Discounts Risk . The net asset value of Fund Shares will generally fluctuate with\nchanges in the market value of the Fund's securities holdings. The market prices of Fund Shares will\ngenerally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the Fund's net asset value and supply and demand of Fund\nShares on the Exchange. It cannot be predicted whether Fund Shares will trade below, at or above their net\nasset value. Price differences may be due, in large part, to the fact that supply and demand forces at work\nin the secondary trading market for Fund Shares will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same\nforces influencing the prices of the securities of the Index trading individually or in the aggregate at any\npoint in time. The market prices of Fund Shares may deviate significantly from the net asset value of Fund\nShares during periods of market volatility. However, given that Fund Shares can be created and redeemed in\nCreation Units (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts\nfrom, and sometimes at premiums to, their net asset value), the Adviser believes that large discounts or\npremiums to the net asset value of Fund Shares should not be sustained over long periods. While the\ncreation/redemption feature is designed to make it likely that Fund Shares normally will trade 6 close to\nthe Fund's net asset value, disruptions to creations and redemptions or market volatility may result in\ntrading prices that differ significantly from the Fund's net asset value. If an investor purchases Fund\nShares at a time when the market price is at a premium to the net asset value of Fund Shares or sells at a\ntime when the market price is at a discount to the net asset value of Fund Shares, then the investor may\nsustain losses. Income Risk. The Fund's income may decline due to falling interest rates or other factors.\nIssuers of securities held by the Fund may call or redeem the securities during periods of falling interest\nrates, and the Fund would likely be required to reinvest in securities paying lower interest rates. If an\nobligation held by the Fund is prepaid, the Fund may have to reinvest the prepayment in other obligations\npaying income at lower rates. A reduction in the income earned by the Fund may limit the Fund's ability to\nachieve its objective. Indexing Strategy/Index Tracking Risk . The Fund is managed with an indexing\ninvestment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities. The Fund will\nseek to provide investment results that correspond generally to the performance of the Index, regardless of\nthe current or projected performance of the Index or of the actual securities comprising the Index. This\ndiffers from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. The Fund\ngenerally will buy and will not sell a security included in the Index as long as the security is part of the\nIndex regardless of any sudden or material decline in value or foreseeable material decline in value of the\nsecurity, even though the Adviser may make a different investment decision for other actively managed\naccounts or portfolios that hold the security. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less favorable\nthan that of a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy. The structure and composition of the\nIndex will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index (in absolute terms and by comparison\nwith other indices) and, consequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the Fund. Errors in index\ndata, index computations or the construction of the Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from\ntime to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. To the extent circumstances evolve in\nbetween reconstitutions, the Index may include, and the Fund may therefore hold for a period of time,\nsecurities of companies that do not align with the Index's objective and/or criteria. While the Adviser\nseeks to track the performance of the Index (i.e., achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the\nFund's return may not match the return of the Index for a number of reasons. For example, the return on the\nsample of securities purchased by the Fund (or the return on securities not included in the Index) may not\ncorrelate precisely with the return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not\napplicable to the Index, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. In addition, the Fund may not be\nfully invested at times, either as a result of cash flows into or out of the Fund or reserves of cash held\nby the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to track the Index return by investing in fewer\nthan all of the securities in the Index, or in some securities not included in the Index, potentially\nincreasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return and that of the Index. Changes in the\ncomposition of the Index and regulatory requirements also may impact the Fund's ability to match the return\nof the Index. The Adviser may apply one or more \u201c screens \u201d or investment techniques to refine or limit the\nnumber or types of issuers included in the Index in which the Fund may invest. Application of such screens\nor techniques may result in investment performance below that of the Index and may not produce results\nexpected by the Adviser. Index tracking risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility\nor other unusual market conditions. Pursuant to the Index methodology, a security may be removed from the\nIndex in the event that it does not comply with the eligibility requirements of the Index. As a result, the\nFund may be forced to sell securities at inopportune times and/or unfavorable prices due to these changes in\nthe Index components. When there are changes made to the component securities of the Index and the Fund in\nturn makes similar changes to its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund's\nportfolio and the Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio changes will\nbe borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled changes to the Index may expose the Fund to\nadditional tracking error risk. The Fund may recognize gains as a result of rebalancing or reconstituting\nits securities holdings to reflect changes in the securities included in the Index. The Fund also may be\nrequired to distribute any such gains to its shareholders to avoid adverse federal income tax consequences.\nInterest Rate Risk . Interest rate risk is the risk that the securities held by the Fund will decline in\nvalue because of increases in market interest rates. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity\nof a security's price to changes in interest rates. Debt securities with longer durations tend to be more\nsensitive to changes in interest rates, usually making them more volatile than debt securities with shorter\ndurations. For example, the value of a security with a duration of five years would be expected to decrease\nby 5% for every 1% increase in interest rates. Falling interest 7 rates also create the potential for a\ndecline in the Fund's income and yield. Interest-only and principal-only securities are especially sensitive\nto interest rate changes, which can affect not only their prices but can also change the income flows and\nrepayment assumptions about those investments. Variable and floating rate securities also generally increase\nor decrease in value in response to changes in interest rates, although generally to a lesser degree than\nfixed-rate securities. A substantial increase in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on the\nliquidity of a security, especially those with longer durations. Interest rate changes can be sudden and\nunpredictable, and are influenced by a number of factors, including government policy, monetary policy,\ninflation expectations, perceptions of risk, and supply and demand for bonds. Changes in government or\ncentral bank policy, including changes in tax policy or changes in a central bank's implementation of\nspecific policy goals, may have a substantial impact on interest rates. This could lead to heightened levels\nof interest rate, volatility and liquidity risks for the fixed income markets generally and could have a\nsubstantial and immediate effect on the values of the Fund's investments. There can be no guarantee that any\nparticular government or central bank policy will be continued, discontinued or changed, nor that any such\npolicy will have the desired effect on interest rates. Liquidity Risk . Liquidity risk is the risk that the\nFund may not be able to dispose of investments readily at a favorable time or prices (or at all) or at\nprices approximating those at which the Fund currently values them. For example, certain investments may be\nsubject to restrictions on resale, may trade in the over-the-counter market or in limited volume, or may not\nhave an active trading market. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid\ninvestments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. It may be difficult for the Fund to\nvalue illiquid investments accurately. The market for certain investments may become illiquid under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions independent of any specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular\nissuer. If the liquidity of the Fund's holdings deteriorates, it may lead to differences between the market\nprice of Fund Shares and the net asset value of Fund Shares, and could result in the Fund Shares being less\nliquid. Disposal of illiquid investments may entail registration expenses and other transaction costs that\nare higher than those for liquid investments. The Fund may seek to borrow money to meet its obligations\n(including among other things redemption obligations) if it is unable to dispose of illiquid investments,\nresulting in borrowing expenses and possible leveraging of the Fund. Market Risk . Market prices of\ninvestments held by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The Fund's investments\nare subject to changes in general economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in\ninvestment in securities markets. Investment markets can be volatile, and prices of investments can change\nsubstantially due to various factors, including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes\nin interest rates, inflation, changes in actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers and general market\nliquidity. Even if general economic conditions do not change, the value of an investment in the Fund could\ndecline if the particular industries, sectors or companies in which the Fund invests do not perform well or\nare adversely affected by events. Further, legal, political, regulatory and tax changes also may cause\nfluctuations in markets and securities prices. Local, regional or global events such as war, military\nconflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, or other events could have a\nsignificant impact on the Fund and its investments. Due to the interconnectedness of economies and financial\nmarkets throughout the world, if the Fund invests in securities of issuers located in or with significant\nexposure to countries experiencing economic and financial difficulties, the value and liquidity of the\nFund's investments may be negatively affected. A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as\nCOVID-19, and efforts to contain its spread, may result in market volatility, inflation, reduced liquidity\nof certain instruments, disruption in the trading of certain instruments, and systemic economic weakness.\nThe foregoing could impact the Fund and its investments and result in disruptions to the services provided\nto the Fund by its service providers. Additionally, in March 2023, the shutdown of certain financial\ninstitutions raised economic concerns over disruption in the U.S. banking system. There can be no certainty\nthat the actions taken by the U.S. government to strengthen public confidence in the U.S. banking system\nwill be effective in mitigating the effects of financial institution failures on the economy and restoring\npublic confidence in the U.S. banking system. New Fund Risk . The Fund is new and there is no assurance that\nthe Fund will grow quickly. When the Fund's size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume, which\ncould lead to wider bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund\ndoes not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause\nelevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders. 8 Reinvestment\nRisk. Income from the Fund's portfolio may decline when the Fund invests the proceeds from investment\nincome, sales of portfolio securities or matured, traded or called debt obligations. For instance, during\nperiods of declining interest rates, an issuer of debt obligations may exercise an option to redeem\nsecurities prior to maturity, forcing the Fund to reinvest the proceeds in lower-yielding securities. A\ndecline in income received by the Fund from its investments is likely to have a negative effect on the yield\nand total return of the Fund Shares. Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend portfolio securities in an\namount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets. For these purposes, net assets shall exclude the\nvalue of all assets received as collateral for the loan. Such loans may be terminated at any time. Any such\nloans must be continuously secured by collateral maintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal\nto the market value of the securities loaned by the Fund, marked to market each trading day. The Fund will\nreceive the amount of all dividends, interest and other distributions on the loaned securities; however, the\nborrower has the right to vote the loaned securities. The Fund will call loans to vote proxies if a material\nissue affecting the investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to recall such securities promptly may be\nunsuccessful, especially for foreign securities or thinly traded securities. Securities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the\nsecurities in a timely manner or at all. Should the borrower of the securities fail financially, the Fund\nmay experience delays in recovering the securities or exercising its rights in the collateral. Loans are\nmade only to borrowers that are deemed by the securities lending agent to be of good financial standing. In\na loan transaction, the Fund will also bear the risk of any decline in value of securities provided as\ncollateral or acquired with cash collateral. The Fund will attempt to minimize this risk by limiting the\ninvestment of cash collateral to high quality instruments of short maturity either directly on behalf of the\nlending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or funds, which may include those managed by the Adviser.\nTo the extent the collateral provided or investments made with cash collateral differ from securities\nincluded in the Index, such collateral or investments may have a greater risk of loss than the securities\nincluded in the Index. In addition, the Fund will be subject to the risk that any income generated by\nlending its securities or reinvesting cash collateral is lower than any fees the Fund has agreed to pay a\nborrower. The Adviser will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for\ndividends when overseeing the Fund's securities lending activity. U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk . U.S.\nTreasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance\nand other characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of\nthe U.S. government may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. The total public\ndebt of the United States as a percentage of gross domestic product grew rapidly after the financial crisis\nof 2008 and has remained at a historically high level. Although high debt levels do not necessarily indicate\nor cause economic problems, they may create certain systemic risks if sound debt management practices are\nnot implemented. A high national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding needs,\nwhich may drive debt cost higher and cause a country to sell additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing\nrisk. A high national debt also raises concerns that a government will not be able to make principal or\ninterest payments when they are due. In the worst case, unsustainable debt levels can cause a decline in the\nvalue of the dollar (which may lead to inflation), and can prevent the U.S. government from implementing\neffective countercyclical fiscal policy in economic downturns. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings\nServices downgraded U.S. Treasury securities from AAA rating to AA+ rating. Standard & Poor's Ratings\nServices stated that its decision was prompted by its view on the rising public debt burden and its\nperception of greater policymaking uncertainty. Fitch also downgraded its rating of U.S. Treasury securities\nfrom AAA to AA+ in August 2023, citing increasing government debt and erosion in confidence regarding\ngovernance of fiscal matters as a result of repeated political standoffs related to debt limit approvals. A\ndowngrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other\nborrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate borrowers, cause\ndisruptions in the international bond markets and have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy.\nAny additional downgrades of U.S. Treasury securities from ratings agencies may cause the value of the\nFund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. In recent years, impasses in Congress regarding the federal\nbudget have caused temporary Federal government shutdowns. While Congress has temporarily suspended the debt\nlimit from time to time, the risks that the U.S. government will not adopt a long-term budget or deficit\nreduction plan, of one or more additional Federal government shutdowns or of future failures to not increase\nthe Federal government's debt limit, may affect investor and consumer confidence and may adversely impact\nfinancial markets and the broader economy, perhaps suddenly and to a significant degree. 9 Valuation Risk .\nSome portfolio holdings, potentially a large portion of the Fund's investment portfolio, may be valued on\nthe basis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or\nreduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market\nquotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time\nmight differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market\nquotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including \u201c\nfair valued \u201d securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next\nthan if market quotations were used. Technological issues or other service disruption issues involving\nthird-party service providers may cause the Fund to value its investments incorrectly. In addition, there is\nno assurance that the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at\nany time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed\nout at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that time. Non-Principal Risks Authorized\nParticipants, Market Makers and Liquidity Providers Concentration Risk. The Fund has a limited number of\nfinancial institutions that may act as Authorized Participants ( \u201c APs \u201d ), which are responsible for the\ncreation and redemption activity for the Fund. In addition, there may be a limited number of market makers\nand/or liquidity providers in the marketplace. To the extent either of the following events occur, Fund\nShares may trade at a material discount to NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit the business or\notherwise become unable to process creation and/or redemption orders and no other APs step forward to\nperform these services, or (ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers exit the business or significantly\nreduce their business activities and no other entities step forward to perform their functions. Cash\nTransaction Risk . To the extent the Fund sells portfolio securities to meet some or all of a redemption\nrequest with cash, the Fund may incur taxable gains or losses that it might not have incurred had it made\nredemptions entirely in-kind. As a result, the Fund may pay out higher annual capital gain distributions\nthan if the in-kind redemption process was used. Conflicts of Interest Risk. An investment in the Fund will\nbe subject to a number of actual or potential conflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser or its\naffiliates may provide services to the Fund, such as securities lending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for which the Fund would compensate the Adviser and/or such\naffiliates. The Fund may invest in other pooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise\naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no assurance that the rates at which the Fund pays fees or expenses to\nthe Adviser or its affiliates, or the terms on which it enters into transactions with the Adviser or its\naffiliates will be the most favorable available in the market generally or as favorable as the rates the\nAdviser or its affiliates make available to other clients. Because of its financial interest, the Adviser\nwill have an incentive to enter into transactions or arrangements on behalf of the Fund with itself or its\naffiliates in circumstances where it might not have done so in the absence of that interest, provided that\nthe Adviser will comply with applicable regulatory requirements. The Adviser and its affiliates serve as\ninvestment adviser to other clients and may make investment decisions that may be different from those that\nwill be made by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund. For example, the Adviser may provide asset allocation\nadvice to some clients that may include a recommendation to invest in or redeem from particular issuers\nwhile not providing that same recommendation to all clients invested in the same or similar issuers. The\nAdviser may (subject to applicable law) be simultaneously seeking to purchase (or sell) investments for the\nFund and to sell (or purchase) the same investment for accounts, funds, or structured products for which it\nserves as asset manager, or for other clients or affiliates. The Adviser and its affiliates may invest for\nclients in various securities that are senior, pari passu or junior to, or have interests different from or\nadverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund. The Adviser or its affiliates, in connection with its\nother business activities, may acquire material nonpublic confidential information that may restrict the\nAdviser from purchasing securities or selling securities for itself or its clients (including the Fund) or\notherwise using such information for the benefit of its clients or itself. The foregoing does not purport to\nbe a comprehensive list or complete explanation of all potential conflicts of interests which may affect the\nFund. The Fund may encounter circumstances, or enter into transactions, in which conflicts of interest that\nare not listed or discussed above may arise. 10 Costs of Buying and Selling Shares . Investors buying or\nselling Fund Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by\nbrokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a\nsignificant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of Fund Shares.\nIn addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the difference between the price that an\ninvestor is willing to pay for Fund Shares (the \u201c bid \u201d price) and the price at which an investor is willing\nto sell Fund Shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price). This difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as the \u201c\nspread \u201d or \u201c bid/ask spread. \u201d The bid/ask spread varies over time for Fund Shares based on trading volume\nand market liquidity, and is generally lower if Fund Shares have more trading volume and market liquidity\nand higher if Fund Shares have little trading volume and market liquidity. Further, increased market\nvolatility may cause increased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling Fund Shares, including\nbid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Fund Shares may significantly reduce investment results and an\ninvestment in Fund Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small\ninvestments. Counterparty Risk. The Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties\nwith which the Fund enters into derivatives contracts and other transactions such as repurchase agreements\nor reverse repurchase agreements. The Fund's ability to profit from these types of investments and\ntransactions will depend on the willingness and ability of its counterparty to perform its obligations. If a\ncounterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, the Fund may be unable to terminate or realize any\ngain on the investment or transaction, resulting in a loss to the Fund. The Fund may experience significant\ndelays in obtaining any recovery in an insolvency, bankruptcy, or other reorganization proceeding involving\nits counterparty (including recovery of any collateral posted by it) and may obtain only a limited recovery\nor may obtain no recovery in such circumstances. If the Fund holds collateral posted by its counterparty, it\nmay be delayed or prevented from realizing on the collateral in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency\nproceeding relating to the counterparty. Under applicable law or contractual provisions, including if the\nFund enters into an investment or transaction with a financial institution and such financial institution\n(or an affiliate of the financial institution) experiences financial difficulties, then the Fund may in\ncertain situations be prevented or delayed from exercising its rights to terminate the investment or\ntransaction, or to realize on any collateral and may result in the suspension of payment and delivery\nobligations of the parties under such investment or transactions or in another institution being substituted\nfor that financial institution without the consent of the Fund. Further, the Fund may be subject to \u201c bail-\nin \u201d risk under applicable law whereby, if required by the financial institution's authority, the financial\ninstitution's liabilities could be written down, eliminated or converted into equity or an alternative\ninstrument of ownership. A bail-in of a financial institution may result in a reduction in value of some or\nall of securities and, if the Fund holds such securities or has entered into a transaction with such a\nfinancial security when a bail-in occurs, the Fund may also be similarly impacted. Cybersecurity Risk . With\nthe increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform\nbusiness and operational functions, funds (such as the Fund) and their service providers (including the\nAdviser) may be prone to operational and information security risks resulting from cyber-attacks and/or\ntechnological malfunctions. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate cybersecurity attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing. In general, cyber-attacks are deliberate, but unintentional events may have\nsimilar effects. Cyber-attacks include, among others, stealing or corrupting data maintained online or\ndigitally, preventing legitimate users from accessing information or services on a website, releasing\nconfidential information without authorization, and causing operational disruption. Successful cyber-attacks\nagainst, or security breakdowns of, the Fund, the Adviser or a custodian, transfer agent, or other\naffiliated or third-party service provider may adversely affect the Fund or its shareholders. For instance,\ncyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may interfere with the processing of shareholder or other\ntransactions, affect the Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, cause the release of private shareholder\ninformation or confidential Fund information, impede trading, cause reputational damage, and subject the\nFund to regulatory fines, penalties or financial losses, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and\nadditional compliance costs. Cyber-attacks or technical malfunctions may render records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder ownership of Fund Shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund\ninaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. The Fund may also incur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk\nmanagement in order to prevent cyber incidents in the future. The Fund and its shareholders could be\nnegatively impacted as a result. While the Adviser has established a business continuity plan and systems\ndesigned to minimize the risk of cyber-attacks through the use of technology, processes and controls, there\nare inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not\nbeen identified, given the evolving nature of this threat. The Fund relies on third-party service providers\nfor many of its 11 day-to-day operations, and will be subject to the risk that the protections and protocols\nimplemented by those service providers will be ineffective to protect the Fund from cyber-attack. The\nAdviser does not control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by third-party service providers,\nand such third-party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Adviser or the\nFund. Similar types of cybersecurity risks or technical malfunctions also are present for issuers of\nsecurities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers,\nand may cause the Fund's investment in such securities to lose value. Derivatives Risk. A derivative is a\nfinancial contract the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset,\ninterest rate, or index. Derivative transactions typically involve leverage and may have significant\nvolatility. It is possible that a derivative transaction will result in a loss greater than the principal\namount invested, and the Fund may not be able to close out a derivative transaction at a favorable time or\nprice. Risks associated with derivative instruments include potential changes in value in response to\ninterest rate changes or other market developments or as a result of the counterparty's credit quality; the\npotential for the derivative transaction not to have the effect the Adviser anticipated or a different or\nless favorable effect than the Adviser anticipated; the failure of the counterparty to the derivative\ntransaction to perform its obligations under the transaction or to settle a trade; possible mispricing or\nimproper valuation of the derivative instrument; imperfect correlation in the value of a derivative with the\nasset, rate, or index underlying the derivative; the risk that the Fund may be required to post collateral\nor margin with its counterparty, and will not be able to recover the collateral or margin in the event of\nthe counterparty's insolvency or bankruptcy; the risk that the Fund will experience losses on its\nderivatives investments and on its other portfolio investments, even when the derivatives investments may be\nintended in part or entirely to hedge those portfolio investments; the risks specific to the asset\nunderlying the derivative instrument; lack of liquidity for the derivative instrument, including without\nlimitation absence of a secondary trading market; the potential for reduced returns to the Fund due to\nlosses on the transaction and an increase in volatility; the potential for the derivative transaction to\nhave the effect of accelerating the recognition of gain; and legal risks arising from the documentation\nrelating to the derivative transaction. Index Construction Risk . A security included in the Index may not\nexhibit the characteristic or provide the specific exposure for which it was selected and consequently the\nFund's holdings may not exhibit returns consistent with that characteristic or exposure. Index Licensing\nRisk . It is possible that the license under which the Adviser or the Fund is permitted to replicate or\notherwise use the Index will be terminated or may be disputed, impaired or cease to remain in effect. In\nsuch a case, the Adviser may be required to replace the Index with another index which it considers to be\nappropriate in light of the investment strategy of the Fund. The use of any such substitute index may have\nan adverse impact on the Fund's performance. In the event that the Adviser is unable to identify a suitable\nreplacement for the Index, it may determine to terminate the Fund. Leveraging Risk . Borrowing transactions,\nreverse repurchase agreements, certain derivatives transactions, securities lending transactions and other\ninvestment transactions such as when-issued, delayed-delivery, or forward commitment transactions may create\ninvestment leverage. If the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund's\ninvestment portfolio, the value of the Fund will be potentially more volatile and all other risks will tend\nto be compounded. This is because leverage generally creates investment risk with respect to a larger base\nof assets than the Fund would otherwise have and so magnifies the effect of any increase or decrease in the\nvalue of the Fund's underlying assets. The use of leverage is considered to be a speculative investment\npractice and may result in losses to the Fund. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss,\nregardless of the size of the initial investment. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy repayment, interest payment, or margin\nobligations or to meet asset coverage requirements. Money Market Fund Investment Risk . An investment in a\nmoney market fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other\ngovernment agency. Certain money market funds seek to preserve the value of their shares at $1.00 per share,\nalthough there can be no assurance that they will do so, and it is possible to lose money by investing in\nsuch a money market fund. A major or unexpected change in interest rates or a decline in the credit quality\nof an issuer or entity providing credit support, an inactive trading market for money market instruments, or\nadverse market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions could cause\nthe share price of such a money market fund to fall below $1.00. It is possible that such a money market\nfund will issue and redeem shares at $1.00 per share at times when the fair value of the money market fund's\nportfolio per 12\n\nshare is more or less than $1.00. None of State Street Corporation, State Street, State Street Global\nAdvisors, Inc. ( \u201c SSGA \u201d ), SSGA FM or their affiliates ( \u201c State Street Entities \u201d ) guarantee the value\nof an investment in a money market fund at $1.00 per share. Investors should have no expectation of capital\nsupport to a money market fund from State Street Entities. Other money market funds price and transact at a\n\u201c floating \u201d NAV that will fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Shares\nsold utilizing a floating NAV may be worth more or less than their original purchase price. Recent changes\nin the regulation of money market funds may affect the operations and structures of money market funds. A\nmoney market fund may be permitted or required to impose redemption fees during times of market stress.\nPortfolio Turnover Risk . The Fund may engage in frequent trading of its portfolio securities. Fund turnover\ngenerally involves a number of direct and indirect costs and expenses to the Fund, including, for example,\nbrokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and bid/asked spreads, and transaction costs on the sale of\nsecurities and reinvestment in other securities. The costs related to increased portfolio turnover have the\neffect of reducing the Fund's investment return, and the sale of securities by the Fund may result in the\nrealization of taxable capital gains, including short-term capital gains. The Fund may engage in significant\ntrading of its portfolio securities in connection with Index rebalancing. Frequent or significant trading\nmay cause the Fund to incur additional transaction costs and experience different tax consequences in\ncomparison to an ETF that does not engage in frequent or significant trading. Regulatory Risk. Governmental\nand regulatory actions may have unexpected or adverse consequences on particular markets, strategies, or\ninvestments, which may adversely impact the Fund and impair how it is managed. Policy and legislative\nchanges in the United States and in other countries may affect aspects of financial regulation, and may in\nsome instances contribute to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the financial markets. The\nimpact of these changes on the markets, and the practical implications for market participants, may not be\nfully known for some time. Trading Issues . Although Fund Shares are listed for trading on the Exchange and\nmay be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the Exchange, there can be no\nassurance that an active trading market for the Fund Shares will develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund\nShares on the Exchange may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the\nExchange, make trading in Fund Shares inadvisable. In addition, trading in Fund Shares on the Exchange is\nsubject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to Exchange \u201c circuit breaker \u201d\nrules. Similar to the shares of operating companies listed on a stock exchange, Fund Shares may be sold\nshort and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility in the trading price of the Fund's\nshares. While the Fund expects that the ability of Authorized Participants to create and redeem Fund Shares\nat net asset value should be effective in reducing any such volatility, there is no guarantee that it will\neliminate the volatility associated with such short sales. There can be no assurance that the requirements\nof the Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of the Fund will continue to be met or will remain\nunchanged or that Fund Shares will trade with any volume, or at all, on any stock exchange. Management\nInvestment Adviser SSGA FM serves as the investment adviser to the Fund and, subject to the oversight of the\nBoard, is responsible for the investment management of the Fund. The Adviser provides an investment\nmanagement program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund's assets. In addition, the Adviser\nwill provide administrative, compliance and general management services to the Fund. The Adviser is a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc., which is itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nState Street Corporation. The Adviser is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,\nas amended. The Adviser and certain other affiliates of State Street Corporation make up SSGA. SSGA is one\nof the world's largest institutional money managers and the investment management arm of State Street\nCorporation. As of March 31, 2024, the Adviser managed approximately $1.00 trillion in assets and SSGA\nmanaged approximately $4.06 trillion in assets. The Adviser's principal business address is One Iron Street,\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210. For the services provided to the Fund under the Investment Advisory Agreement,\nthe Fund expects to pay the Adviser the annual fee based on a percentage of the Fund's average daily net\nassets as set forth below:\n                                      \n  SPDR Portfolio Treasury ETF  0.03%  \n                                      \n13\n\nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all or a portion of its management fee. The Adviser has\ncontractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount equal\nto any acquired fund fees and expenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash management purposes,\nif any) for the Fund until October 31, 2025. This waiver and/or reimbursement does not provide for the\nrecoupment by the Adviser of any amounts waived or reimbursed. This waiver and/or reimbursement may not be\nterminated prior to October 31, 2025, except with the approval of the Board. The Adviser pays all expenses\nof the Fund other than the management fee, brokerage expenses, taxes, interest, fees and expenses of the\nIndependent Trustees (including any Trustee's counsel fees), litigation expenses, acquired fund fees and\nexpenses and other extraordinary expenses. A summary of the factors considered by the Board in connection\nwith the initial approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement for the Fund will be available in the Fund's\nForm N-CSR filing with the SEC for the period ended June 30, 2024. SSGA FM, as the investment adviser for\nthe Fund, may hire one or more sub-advisers to oversee the day-to-day investment activities of the Fund. The\nsub-advisers are subject to oversight by the Adviser. The Adviser and SPDR Series Trust (the \u201c Trust \u201d )\nhave received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits the Adviser, with the approval of the Board,\nincluding a majority of the Independent Trustees, of the Trust, to retain and amend existing sub-advisory\nagreements with unaffiliated investment sub-advisers for the Fund without submitting the sub-advisory\nagreement to a vote of the Fund's shareholders. The Trust will notify shareholders in the event of any\nchange in the identity of such sub-adviser or sub-advisers. The Adviser has ultimate responsibility for the\ninvestment performance of the Fund due to its responsibility to oversee each sub-adviser and recommend their\nhiring, termination and replacement. The Adviser is not required to disclose fees paid to any unaffiliated\nsub-adviser retained pursuant to the order. Portfolio Managers.\nThe Fund is managed using a team of investment professionals. The team approach is used to create an\nenvironment that encourages the flow of investment ideas. The portfolio managers within the team work\ntogether in a cohesive manner to develop and enhance techniques that drive the investment process for the\ninvestment strategy. This approach requires portfolio managers to share a variety of responsibilities\nincluding investment strategy and analysis while retaining responsibility for the implementation of the\nstrategy within any particular portfolio. The approach also enables the team to draw upon the resources of\nother groups within SSGA. The portfolio management team is overseen by the SSGA Investment Committee. The\nprofessionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund are Joanna Madden and Cynthia\nMoy. Joanna Madden is a Vice President of SSGA and the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income\nBeta Solutions Group since 2013. Previously, Ms. Madden was a portfolio manager in the U.S. Cash Management\nGroup responsible for short-term liquidity investments across all the cash and securities lending portfolios\nmanaged in Boston. She joined the Boston group in April 2010 after working as a portfolio manager with the\nLondon Cash Management Group. Prior to her portfolio management role, she was a product analyst for the\nLondon Cash Management Group where she provided analytical and business support. Before joining SSGA in\nLondon, Ms. Madden worked as an operations specialist supporting the Boston Cash Management Group. Ms.\nMadden received a Bachelor of Science in Political Science from Loyola University of Chicago, Illinois.\nCynthia Moy is a Principal of SSGA and the Adviser and a Portfolio Manager in the Fixed Income Beta\nSolutions Group. As part of the portfolio management team, she is responsible for managing government bond\nstrategies. Previously, Ms. Moy was an analyst in the Government Solutions Team, where she was responsible\nfor credit surveillance of housing finance agency bonds. Ms. Moy's prior roles at State Street also include\nwork as an analyst in the Stable Value Team, the Global Structured Products Group, as well as the Mutual\nFunds Division. Ms. Moy holds a Bachelor of Arts in Quantitative Economics from Tufts University. Additional\ninformation about the portfolio managers' compensation, other accounts managed by the portfolio managers,\nand the portfolio managers' ownership of the Fund is available in the SAI. Administrator, Sub-Administrator,\nCustodian and Transfer Agent. The Adviser serves as Administrator for the Fund. State Street, part of State\nStreet Corporation, is the Sub-Administrator for the Fund and the Custodian for the Fund's assets, and\nserves as Transfer Agent to the Fund. 14 Lending Agent. State Street is the securities lending agent for the\nTrust. For its services, the lending agent would typically receive a portion of the net investment income,\nif any, earned on the collateral for the securities loaned. Distributor. State Street Global Advisors Funds\nDistributors, LLC ( \u201c SSGA FD \u201d or the \u201c Distributor \u201d ), serves as the Fund's distributor pursuant to the\nDistribution Agreement between SSGA FD and the Trust. The Distributor will not distribute Fund Shares in\nless than Creation Units, and it does not maintain a secondary market in Fund Shares. The Distributor may\nenter into selected dealer agreements with other broker-dealers or other qualified financial institutions\nfor the sale of Creation Units of Fund Shares. Additional Information . The Board oversees generally the\noperations of the Fund and the Trust. The Trust enters into contractual arrangements with various parties,\nincluding among others the Fund's investment adviser, custodian, transfer agent, and accountants, who\nprovide services to the Fund. Shareholders are not parties to any such contractual arrangements or intended\nbeneficiaries of those contractual arrangements, and those contractual arrangements are not intended to\ncreate in any shareholder any right to enforce them directly against the service providers or to seek any\nremedy under them directly against the service providers.

Additional Purchase and Sale Information Fund Shares are listed for secondary trading on\nthe Exchange and individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and sold in the secondary market through a\nbroker-dealer. The secondary markets are closed on weekends and also are generally closed on the following\nholidays: New Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day\n(observed), Juneteenth National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and\nChristmas Day. The Exchange may close early on the business day before certain holidays and on the day after\nThanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to change without notice. If you buy or sell Fund\nShares in the secondary market, you will pay the secondary market price for Fund Shares. In addition, you\nmay incur customary brokerage commissions and charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the bid\nand the offered price in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction.\nThe trading prices of Fund Shares will fluctuate continuously throughout trading hours based on market\nsupply and demand rather than the Fund's net asset value, which is calculated for the Fund once daily as of\nthe close of the regular trading session on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each day that\nsuch exchange is open. Fund Shares will trade on the Exchange at prices that may be above ( i.e ., at a\npremium) or below ( i.e ., at a discount), to varying degrees, the calculated net asset value of Fund\nShares. The trading prices of Fund Shares may deviate significantly from the Fund's net asset value during\nperiods of market volatility. Given, however, that Fund Shares can be issued and redeemed daily in Creation\nUnits, the Adviser believes that large discounts and premiums to net asset value should not be sustained\nover long periods. The Exchange will disseminate, every fifteen seconds during the regular trading day, an\nindicative optimized portfolio value ( \u201c IOPV \u201d ) relating to the Fund. The IOPV calculations are estimates\nof the value of the Fund's net asset value per Fund Share. Premiums and discounts between the IOPV and the\nmarket price may occur. This should not be viewed as a \u201c real-time \u201d update of the net asset value per Fund\nShare. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the published basket of portfolio securities and/or\ncash required to be deposited in exchange for a Creation Unit and does not necessarily reflect the precise\ncomposition of the Fund's actual portfolio at a particular point in time. Moreover, the IOPV is generally\ndetermined by using current market quotations and/or price quotations obtained from broker-dealers and other\nmarket intermediaries and valuations based on current market rates. The IOPV may not be calculated in the\nsame manner as the NAV, which (i) is computed only once a day, (ii) unlike the calculation of the IOPV,\ntakes into account Fund expenses, and (iii) may be subject, in accordance with the requirements of the 1940\nAct, to fair valuation at different prices than those used in the calculations of the IOPV. When applicable,\nthe IOPV price is based on quotes and closing prices from the securities' local market converted into U.S.\ndollars at the current currency rates and may not reflect events that occur subsequent to the local market's\nclose. Therefore, the IOPV may not reflect the best possible valuation of the Fund's current portfolio.\nNeither the Fund nor the Adviser or any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the\ncalculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and make no warranty as to their accuracy. The Fund does not\nimpose any restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions; however, the Fund reserves the right\nto reject or limit purchases at any time as described in the SAI. When considering that no restriction or\npolicy was necessary, the Board evaluated the risks posed by market timing activities, such as whether\nfrequent purchases and redemptions would interfere with the efficient implementation of the Fund's\ninvestment strategy, or whether they would cause the Fund to experience increased transaction costs. The\nBoard considered that, unlike traditional mutual funds, Fund Shares are issued and redeemed only in large\nquantities of shares known as Creation Units, available only from the Fund directly, and that most trading\nin the Fund occurs on the Exchange at prevailing 16 market prices and does not involve the Fund directly.\nGiven this structure, the Board determined that it is unlikely that (a) market timing would be attempted by\nthe Fund's shareholders or (b) any attempts to market time the Fund by shareholders would result in negative\nimpact to the Fund or its shareholders. Distributions Dividends and Capital Gains. As a Fund shareholder,\nyou are entitled to your share of the Fund's income and net realized gains on its investments. The Fund pays\nout substantially all of its net earnings to its shareholders as \u201c distributions. \u201d The Fund may earn\ninterest from debt securities and, if participating, securities lending income. The Fund will generally\nrealize short-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets held for one year or less.\nNet short-term capital gains will generally be treated as ordinary income when distributed to shareholders.\nThe Fund will generally realize long-term capital gains or losses whenever it sells or exchanges assets held\nfor more than one year. Net capital gains (the excess of the Fund's net long-term capital gains over its net\nshort-term capital losses) are distributed to shareholders as \u201c capital gain distributions. \u201d Income\ndividend distributions, if any, are generally distributed to shareholders monthly, but may vary\nsignificantly from period to period. Net capital gains for the Fund are distributed at least annually.\nDividends may be declared and paid more frequently or at any other time to improve Index tracking or to\ncomply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c Code \u201d ).\nA portion of each distribution may result in a return of capital. You will be notified regarding the portion\nof the distribution which represents a return of capital. Distributions in cash may be reinvested\nautomatically in additional whole Fund Shares only if the broker through whom you purchased Fund Shares\nmakes such option available. Distributions which are reinvested will nevertheless be taxable to the same\nextent as if such distributions had not been reinvested. Portfolio Holdings Disclosure The Fund's portfolio\nholdings disclosure policy is described in the SAI. In addition, the identities and quantities of the\nsecurities held by the Fund are disclosed on the Fund's website. Additional Tax Information The following\ndiscussion is a summary of some important U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to an\ninvestment in the Fund. Your investment in the Fund may have other tax implications. Please consult your tax\nadvisor about federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws applicable to you. Investors, including\nnon-U.S. investors, may wish to consult the SAI tax section for additional disclosure. Taxes On\nDistributions. In general, your distributions (other than exempt-interest dividends) are subject to federal\nincome tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. The income\ndividends (other than exempt-interest dividends) and short-term capital gains distributions you receive from\nthe Fund will generally be taxed as ordinary income. Any distributions of the Fund's net capital gains are\ntaxable as long-term capital gain regardless of how long you have owned Fund Shares. Long-term capital gains\nare generally taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Distributions in excess of the Fund's\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of\nyour basis in the applicable Fund's shares, and, in general, as capital gain thereafter. Since the Fund\nprimarily holds investments that do not pay dividends, it is not expected that a substantial portion (if\nany) of the dividends paid by the Fund will qualify for either the dividends-received deduction for\ncorporations or the favorable income tax rates available to individuals on qualified dividend income. U.S.\nindividuals with income exceeding specified thresholds are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on\nall or a portion of their \u201c net investment income, \u201d which includes taxable interest, dividends and certain\ncapital gains (generally including capital gain distributions and capital gains realized upon the sale of\nFund Shares). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of the undistributed net investment income of\ncertain shareholders that are estates and trusts. 17 Certain tax-exempt educational institutions will be\nsubject to a 1.4% tax on net investment income. For these purposes, certain dividends and capital gain\ndistributions, and certain gains from the disposition of Fund Shares (among other categories of income), are\ngenerally taken into account in computing a shareholder's net investment income. Distributions paid in\nJanuary, but declared by the Fund in October, November or December of the previous year, payable to\nshareholders of record in such a month, may be taxable to you in the calendar year in which they were\ndeclared. The Fund will inform you of the amount of your ordinary income dividends, capital gain\ndistributions and any qualified dividend income shortly after the close of each calendar year. A\ndistribution will reduce the Fund's net asset value per Fund Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary\nincome or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return\nof capital. Original Issue Discount . Investments by the Fund in zero coupon or other discount securities\nwill result in income to the Fund equal to a portion of the excess face value of the securities over their\nissue price (the \u201c original issue discount \u201d or \u201c OID \u201d ) each year that the securities are held, even\nthough the Fund may receive no cash interest payments or may receive cash interest payments that are less\nthan the income recognized for tax purposes. In other circumstances, whether pursuant to the terms of a\nsecurity or as a result of other factors outside the control of the Fund, the Fund may recognize income\nwithout receiving a commensurate amount of cash. The Fund's share of such income is included in determining\nthe amount that the Fund must distribute to maintain its eligibility for treatment as a regulated investment\ncompany and to avoid the payment of federal tax, including the nondeductible 4% excise tax. Because any\nincome required to be recognized as a result of the OID and/or market discount rules (discussed below) may\nnot be matched by a corresponding cash payment, the Fund may be required to borrow money or dispose of\nsecurities to be able to make distributions to its shareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a\nregulated investment company and eliminate taxes at the Fund level. Inflation-Indexed Bonds. Special rules\napply if the Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest on inflation-indexed bonds\nis taken into income by the Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of\nany positive inflation adjustment for a taxable year, which results from an increase in the inflation-\nadjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. The amount of the Fund's OID in a taxable year\nwith respect to a bond will increase the Fund's taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt\nof cash until the bond matures. As a result, the Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its\ndistribution requirements for such year. The amount of any negative inflation adjustments, which result from\na decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in the Fund's income with\nrespect to the bond for the taxable year; any remaining negative adjustments will be either treated as\nordinary loss or, in certain circumstances, carried forward to reduce the amount of interest income taken\ninto account with respect to the bond in future taxable years. Market Discount. Any market discount\nrecognized on a market discount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond\nacquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or below adjusted issue price if the bond\nwas issued with original issue discount. Absent an election by the Fund to include the market discount in\nincome as it accrues, the gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary\nincome rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount. Where the income required to\nbe recognized as a result of the market discount rules is not matched by a corresponding cash payment, the\nFund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to be able to make distributions to its\nshareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company and eliminate taxes at the\nFund level, potentially resulting in additional taxable gain or loss to the Fund. Derivatives and Other\nComplex Securities. The Fund may invest in complex securities. These investments may be subject to numerous\nspecial and complex rules. These rules could affect whether gains and losses recognized by the Fund are\ntreated as ordinary income or capital gain, accelerate the recognition of income to the Fund and/or defer\nthe Fund's ability to recognize losses. In turn, these rules may affect the amount, timing or character of\nthe income distributed to you by the Fund. You should consult your personal tax advisor regarding the\napplication of these rules. Index Concentration . In order to qualify for the favorable tax treatment\ngenerally available to regulated investment companies, the Fund must satisfy certain diversification\nrequirements. In particular, the Fund generally may not acquire a security if, as a result of the\nacquisition, more than 50% of the value of the Fund's assets would be invested in (a) issuers in which the\nFund has, in each case, invested more than 5% of the Fund's assets and (b) issuers more 18 than 10% of whose\noutstanding voting securities are owned by the Fund. It may not be possible for the Fund to fully implement\na sampling methodology while satisfying these diversification requirements. The Fund's efforts to satisfy\nthe diversification requirements may affect the Fund's execution of its investment strategy and may cause\nthe Fund's return to deviate from that of the Index, and the Fund's efforts to track the Index may cause it\ninadvertently to fail to satisfy the diversification requirements. If the Fund were to fail to qualify as a\nRIC, it would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation, and distributions to its shareholders\nwould not be deductible by the Fund in computing its taxable income. Taxes on Exchange-Listed Share Sales.\nAny capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund Shares is generally treated as long-term capital gain\nor loss if Fund Shares have been held for more than one year and as short-term capital gain or loss if Fund\nShares have been held for one year or less, except that any capital loss on the sale of Fund Shares held for\nsix months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid\nwith respect to the Fund Shares. Taxes on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units. A person who\nexchanges securities for Creation Units generally will recognize a gain or loss. The gain or loss will be\nequal to the difference between the market value of the Creation Units at the time and the exchanger's\naggregate basis in the securities surrendered plus any cash paid for the Creation Units. A person who\nexchanges Creation Units for securities will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the exchanger's basis in the Creation Units and the aggregate market value of the securities and the\namount of cash received. The Internal Revenue Service (the \u201c IRS \u201d ), however, may assert that a loss\nrealized upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be deducted currently under the rules\ngoverning \u201c wash sales, \u201d or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position.\nPersons exchanging securities should consult their own tax advisor with respect to whether wash sale rules\napply and when a loss might be deductible. Under current federal tax laws, any capital gain or loss realized\nupon a redemption (or creation) of Creation Units is generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if\nthe Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have been held for more than one year and as a short-term\ncapital gain or loss if the Fund Shares (or securities surrendered) have been held for one year or less. If\nyou create or redeem Creation Units, you will be sent a confirmation statement showing how many Fund Shares\nyou purchased or sold and at what price. The Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has the right to reject an order\nfor Creation Units if the purchaser (or a group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so\nordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the Fund and if, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code,\nthe Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of the securities on the date\nof deposit. The Trust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share\nownership for purposes of the 80% determination. If the Trust does issue Creation Units to a purchaser (or a\ngroup of purchasers) that would, upon obtaining the Fund Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser (or group of purchasers) will not recognize gain or loss upon\nthe exchange of securities for Creation Units. If the Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear\nadditional costs and recognize more capital gains than it would if it redeems Creation Units in-kind.\nCertain Tax-Exempt Investors. The Fund, if investing in certain limited real estate investments and other\npublicly traded partnerships, may be required to pass through certain \u201c excess inclusion income \u201d and other\nincome as \u201c unrelated business taxable income \u201d ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ). Prior to investing in the Fund, tax-exempt\ninvestors sensitive to UBTI should consult their tax advisors regarding this issue and IRS pronouncements\naddressing the treatment of such income in the hands of such investors. Non-U.S. Investors. Ordinary income\ndividends paid by the Fund to shareholders who are non-resident aliens or foreign entities will generally be\nsubject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (other than distributions reported by the Fund as interest-related\ndividends and short-term capital gain dividends), unless a lower treaty rate applies or unless such income\nis effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. In general, the Fund may report interest-related\ndividends to the extent of its net income derived from U.S. source interest, and the Fund may report short-\nterm capital gain dividends to the extent its net short-term capital gain for the taxable year exceeds its\nnet long-term capital loss. Gains on the sale of Fund Shares and dividends that are, in each case,\neffectively connected with the conduct of 19 a trade or business within the U.S. will generally be subject\nto U.S. federal net income taxation at regular income tax rates. Non-U.S. shareholders that own, directly or\nindirectly, more than 5% of the Fund's shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning special\ntax rules that may apply to their investment. Unless certain non-U.S. entities that hold Fund Shares comply\nwith IRS requirements that will generally require them to report information regarding U.S. persons\ninvesting in, or holding accounts with, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to distributions\npayable to such entities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the withholding described in this\nparagraph under an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the applicable foreign government comply with the terms of such agreement.\nBackup Withholding. The Fund will be required in certain cases to withhold (as \u201c backup withholding \u201d ) on\namounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund either an incorrect tax identification\nnumber or no number at all, (2) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report\npayments of interest or dividends, (3) has failed to certify to the Fund that such shareholder is not\nsubject to backup withholding, or (4) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will not be applied\nto payments that have been subject to the 30% withholding tax on shareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the United States. Other Tax Issues. The Fund may be subject to tax in certain states\nwhere the Fund does business (or is treated as doing business as a result of its investments). Furthermore,\nin those states which have income tax laws, the tax treatment of the Fund and of Fund shareholders with\nrespect to distributions by the Fund may differ from federal tax treatment. The foregoing discussion\nsummarizes some of the consequences under current federal income tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is\nnot a substitute for personal tax advice. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax\nconsequences of an investment in the Fund under all applicable tax laws. General Information The Trust was\norganized as a Massachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998. If shareholders of the Fund are required to\nvote on any matters, shareholders are entitled to one vote for each Fund Share they own. Annual meetings of\nshareholders will not be held except as required by the 1940 Act and other applicable law. See the SAI for\nmore information concerning the Trust's form of organization. Management and Organization The Fund is a\nseparate series of the Trust, which is an open-end registered management investment company. From time to\ntime, the Fund may advertise yield and total return figures. Yield is a historical measure of dividend\nincome, and total return is a measure of past dividend income (assuming that it has been reinvested) plus\ncapital appreciation. Neither yield nor total return should be used to predict the future performance of the\nFund. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP serves as counsel to the Trust, including the Fund. Ernst & Young LLP\nserves as the independent registered public accounting firm and will audit the Fund's financial statements\nannually.

The Trust was organized as a\nMassachusetts business trust on June 12, 1998 and the Fund was established on February 22, 2024. The\noffering of the Fund's shares ( \u201c Shares \u201d ) is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\n\u201c Securities Act \u201d ). The investment objective of the Fund is to provide investment results that, before\nfees and expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of a specified market index (the\n\u201c Index \u201d ). SSGA Funds Management, Inc. serves as the investment adviser for the Fund ( \u201c SSGA FM \u201d or the\n\u201c Adviser \u201d ). The Fund offers and issues Shares at their net asset value (sometimes referred to herein as \u201c\nNAV \u201d ) only in aggregations of a specified number of Shares (each, a \u201c Creation Unit \u201d ). The Fund\ngenerally offers and issues Shares in exchange for (i) a basket of securities designated by the Fund ( \u201c\nDeposit Securities \u201d ) together with the deposit of a specified cash payment ( \u201c Cash Component \u201d ) or (ii)\na cash payment equal in value to the Deposit Securities ( \u201c Deposit Cash \u201d ) together with the Cash\nComponent. The primary consideration accepted by the Fund (i.e., Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash) is set\nforth under \u201c Purchase and Redemption of Creation Units \u201d later in this SAI. The Trust reserves the right to\npermit or require the substitution of a \u201c cash in lieu \u201d amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace\nany Deposit Security and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in\nlieu of Deposit Cash (subject to applicable legal requirements). The Shares have been approved for listing\nand secondary trading on a national securities exchange (the \u201c Exchange \u201d ). The Shares will trade on the\nExchange at market prices. These prices may differ from the Shares' net asset values. The Shares are also\nredeemable only in Creation Unit aggregations, and generally in exchange for either (i) portfolio securities\nand a specified cash payment or (ii) cash (subject to applicable legal requirements). Shares may be issued\nin advance of receipt of Deposit Securities subject to various conditions including a requirement to\nmaintain on deposit with the Trust cash at least equal to a specified percentage of the market value of the\nmissing Deposit Securities as set forth in the Participant Agreement (as defined below). See \u201c Purchase and\nRedemption of Creation Units. \u201d The Trust may impose a transaction fee for each creation or redemption. In\nall cases, such fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission ( \u201c SEC \u201d ) applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities. In\naddition to the fixed creation or redemption transaction fee, an additional transaction fee of up to three\ntimes the fixed creation or redemption transaction fee and/or an additional variable charge may apply.\nInvestment Policies The Fund may invest in the following types of investments, consistent with its\ninvestment strategies and objective. Please see the Fund's Prospectus for additional information regarding\nits principal investment strategies. DIVERSIFICATION STATUS The Fund is classified as a \u201c diversified \u201d\ninvestment company under the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, a diversified investment company, as to 75% of\nits total assets, may not purchase securities of any issuer (other than securities issued or guaranteed by\nthe U.S. government, its agents or instrumentalities or securities of other investment companies) if, as a\nresult, more than 5% of its total assets would be invested in the securities of such issuer, or more than\n10% of the issuer's outstanding voting securities would be held by the investment company. The Fund intends\nto maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a\n\u201c regulated investment company \u201d ( \u201c RIC \u201d ) for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(the \u201c Internal Revenue Code \u201d ), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for federal income tax to the\nextent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders. Compliance with the diversification requirements\nof the Internal Revenue Code may severely limit the investment flexibility of the Fund and may make it less\nlikely that the Fund will meet its investment objective. ASSET-BACKED AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED\nSECURITIES Asset-backed securities are securities backed by installment contracts, credit-card receivables\nor other assets. Commercial mortgage-backed securities are securities backed by commercial real estate\nproperties. Both asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities represent interests in \u201c pools \u201d of\nassets in which payments of both interest and principal on the securities are made on a regular basis. The\npayments are, in effect, \u201c passed through \u201d to the holder of the securities (net of any fees paid to the\nissuer or guarantor of the securities). The average life of asset-backed and\n\n3\n\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities varies with the maturities of the underlying instruments and, as a\nresult of prepayments, can often be less than the original maturity of the assets underlying the securities.\nFor this and other reasons, an asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed security's stated maturity may be\nshortened, and the security's total return may be difficult to predict precisely. BONDS A bond is an\ninterest-bearing security issued by a company, governmental unit or, in some cases, a non-U.S. entity. The\nissuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to pay interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to\nrepay principal (the bond's face value) periodically or on a specified maturity date; provided, however, a\nzero coupon bond pays no interest to its holder during its life. The value of a zero coupon bond to the Fund\nconsists of the difference between such bond's face value at the time of maturity and the price for which it\nwas acquired, which may be an amount significantly less than its face value (sometimes referred to as a \u201c\ndeep discount \u201d price). An issuer may have the right to redeem or \u201c call \u201d a bond before maturity, in which\ncase the investor may have to reinvest the proceeds at lower market rates. Most bonds bear interest income\nat a \u201c coupon \u201d rate that is fixed for the life of the bond. The value of a fixed rate bond usually rises\nwhen market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed rate bond's\nyield (income as a percent of the bond's current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its value rises\nor falls. Fixed rate bonds generally are also subject to inflation risk, which is the risk that the value of\nthe bond or income from the bond will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money.\nThis could mean that, as inflation increases, the \u201c real \u201d value of the assets of the Fund holding fixed\nrate bonds can decline, as can the value of the Fund's distributions. Other types of bonds bear income at an\ninterest rate that is adjusted periodically. Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of \u201c\nfloating-rate \u201d or \u201c variable-rate \u201d bonds fluctuates much less in response to market interest rate\nmovements than the value of fixed rate bonds. The Fund may treat some of these bonds as having a shorter\nmaturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its investment portfolio. Bonds may be\nsenior or subordinated obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on a corporation's\nearnings and assets and, in the event of liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be\nunsecured (backed only by the issuer's general creditworthiness) or secured (also backed by specified\ncollateral). The investment return of corporate bonds reflects interest on the bond and changes in the\nmarket value of the bond. The market value of a corporate bond may be affected by the credit rating of the\ncorporation, the corporation's performance and perceptions of the corporation in the market place. There is\na risk that the issuers of the securities may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal\npayments at the time called for by such a security. COMMERCIAL PAPER Commercial paper consists of short-\nterm, promissory notes issued by banks, corporations and other entities to finance short-term credit needs.\nThese securities generally are discounted but sometimes may be interest bearing. CONCENTRATION The Fund will\nconcentrate its investments in securities of issuers in the same industry as may be necessary to approximate\nthe composition of the Fund's underlying Index. The securities of issuers in particular industries may\ndominate the benchmark Index of the Fund and consequently the Fund's investment portfolio. This may\nadversely affect the Fund's performance or subject its Shares to greater price volatility than that\nexperienced by less concentrated investment companies. The Trust's general policy is to exclude securities\nof the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities when measuring industry concentration. In\npursuing its objective, the Fund may hold the securities of a single issuer in an amount exceeding 10% of\nthe market value of the outstanding securities of the issuer, subject to restrictions imposed by the\nInternal Revenue Code. In particular, as the Fund's size grows and its assets increase, it will be more\nlikely to hold more than 10% of the securities of a single issuer if the issuer has a relatively small\npublic float as compared to other components in its benchmark Index. CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES Convertible\nsecurities are bonds, debentures, notes, preferred stock or other securities that may be converted or\nexchanged (by the holder or by the issuer) into shares of the underlying common stock (or cash or securities\nof equivalent value) at a stated exchange ratio. A convertible security may also be called for redemption or\nconversion by the issuer\n\n4\n\nafter a particular date and under certain circumstances (including a specified price) established upon\nissue. If a convertible security held by the Fund is called for redemption or conversion, the Fund could be\nrequired to tender it for redemption, convert it into the underlying common stock, or sell it to a third\nparty. Convertible securities generally have less potential for gain or loss than common stock. Convertible\nsecurities generally provide yields higher than the underlying common stock, but generally lower than\ncomparable non-convertible securities. Because of this higher yield, convertible securities generally sell\nat a price above their \u201c conversion value, \u201d which is the current market value of the stock to be received\nupon conversion. The difference between this conversion value and the price of convertible securities will\nvary over time depending on changes in the value of the underlying common stock and interest rates. When the\nunderlying common stock declines in value, convertible securities will tend not to decline to the same\nextent because of the interest or dividend payments and the repayment of principal at maturity for certain\ntypes of convertible securities. However, securities that are convertible other than at the option of the\nholder generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same extent as securities convertible at the\noption of the holder. When the underlying common stock rises in value, the value of convertible securities\nmay also be expected to increase. At the same time, however, the difference between the market value of\nconvertible securities and their conversion value will narrow, which means that the value of convertible\nsecurities will generally not increase to the same extent as the value of the underlying common stock.\nBecause convertible securities may also be interest-rate sensitive, their value may increase as interest\nrates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Convertible securities are also subject to credit risk, and\nare often lower-quality securities. EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS The Fund may invest in other exchange-traded funds\n( \u201c ETFs \u201d ) (including ETFs managed by the Adviser). ETFs may be structured as investment companies that\nare registered under the 1940 Act, typically as open-end funds or unit investment trusts. These ETFs are\ngenerally based on specific domestic and foreign market securities indices. An \u201c index-based ETF \u201d seeks to\nprovide investment results that match the performance of an index by holding in its portfolio either the\ncontents of the index or a representative sample of the securities in the index. An \u201c actively-managed ETF \u201d\ninvests in securities based on an adviser's investment strategy. An \u201c enhanced ETF \u201d seeks to provide\ninvestment results that match a positive or negative multiple of the performance of an underlying index. In\nseeking to provide such results, an ETF and, in particular, an enhanced ETF, may engage in short sales of\nsecurities included in the underlying index and may invest in derivatives instruments, such as equity index\nswaps, futures contracts, and options on securities, futures contracts, and stock indices. Alternatively,\nETFs may be structured as grantor trusts or other forms of pooled investment vehicles that are not\nregistered or regulated under the 1940 Act. These ETFs typically hold commodities, precious metals, currency\nor other non-securities investments. ETFs, like mutual funds, have expenses associated with their operation,\nsuch as advisory and custody fees. When the Fund invests in an ETF, in addition to directly bearing expenses\nassociated with its own operations, including the brokerage costs associated with the purchase and sale of\nshares of the ETF, the Fund will bear a pro rata portion of the ETF's expenses. In addition, it may be more\ncostly to own an ETF than to directly own the securities or other investments held by the ETF because of ETF\nexpenses. The risks of owning shares of an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying\nsecurities or other investments held by the ETF, although lack of liquidity in the market for the shares of\nan ETF could result in the ETF's value being more volatile than the underlying securities or other\ninvestments. FUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAP AGREEMENTS The Fund may invest in derivatives, including\nexchange-traded futures on indices, exchange-traded futures on Treasuries or Eurodollars, U.S. exchange-\ntraded or OTC put and call options contracts and exchange-traded or OTC swap transactions (including NDFs,\ninterest rate swaps, total return swaps, excess return swaps, and credit default swaps). Futures and Options\non Futures: Futures contracts generally provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another\nparty of a specified commodity or security at a specified future time and at a specified price. Index\nfutures contracts are settled daily with a payment by one party to the other of a cash amount based on the\ndifference between the level of the index specified in the contract from one day to the next. A futures\ncontract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an\namount of cash equal to the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day\nof the contract and the price at which the index contract originally was written. Although the value of an\nindex might be a function of the value of certain specified securities, physical delivery of these\nsecurities is not always made. A public market exists in futures contracts covering a number of indexes, as\nwell as financial instruments, including, without limitation: U.S. Treasury bonds; U.S. Treasury notes; GNMA\nCertificates; three-month U.S. Treasury bills; 90-day commercial paper; bank certificates of deposit;\nEurodollar certificates\n\n5\n\nof deposit; the Australian Dollar; the Canadian Dollar; the British Pound; the Japanese Yen; the Swiss\nFranc; the Mexican Peso; and certain multinational currencies, such as the Euro. It is expected that other\nfutures contracts will be developed and traded in the future. Futures contracts are standardized as to\nmaturity date and underlying instrument and are traded on futures exchanges. The Fund may purchase and write\n(sell) call and put options on futures. Options on futures give the holder the right, in return for the\npremium paid, to assume a long position (call) or short position (put) in a futures contract at a specified\nexercise price upon expiration of, or at any time during the period of, the option. Upon exercise of a call\noption, the holder acquires a long position in the futures contract and the writer is assigned the opposite\nshort position. In the case of a put option, the opposite is true. The Fund is required to make a good faith\nmargin deposit in cash or U.S. government securities (or other eligible collateral) with a broker or\ncustodian to initiate and maintain open positions in futures contracts. A margin deposit is intended to\nassure completion of the contract (delivery or acceptance of the underlying commodity or payment of the cash\nsettlement amount) if it is not terminated prior to the specified delivery date. Brokers may establish\ndeposit requirements which are higher than the exchange minimums. Futures contracts are customarily\npurchased and sold on margin deposits which may range upward from less than 5% of the value of the contract\nbeing traded. After a futures contract position is opened, the value of the contract is marked to market\ndaily. If the futures contract price changes to the extent that the margin on deposit does not satisfy price\nchanges, additional payments will be required. Conversely, change in the contract value may reduce the\nrequired margin, resulting in a repayment of excess margin to the contract holder. Variation margin payments\nare made to and from the futures broker for as long as the contract remains open. In such case, the Fund\nwould expect to earn interest income on its margin deposits. Although some futures contracts call for making\nor taking delivery of the underlying commodity, generally these obligations are closed out prior to delivery\nby offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts (involving the same exchange, underlying\ncommodity, security or index and delivery month). If an offsetting purchase price is less than the original\nsale price, the Fund realizes a capital gain, or if it is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss.\nConversely, if an offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price, the Fund realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is less, the Fund realizes a capital loss. The transaction costs also must be\nincluded in these calculations. Options: The Fund may purchase and sell put and call options. Such options\nmay relate to particular securities and may or may not be listed on a national securities exchange and\nissued by the Options Clearing Corporation. Options trading is a highly specialized activity that entails\ngreater than ordinary investment risk. Options on particular securities may be more volatile than the\nunderlying securities, and therefore, on a percentage basis, an investment in options may be subject to\ngreater fluctuation than an investment in the underlying securities themselves. Short Sales \u201c Against the\nBox \u201d : The Fund may engage in short sales \u201c against the box. \u201d In a short sale against the box, the Fund\nagrees to sell at a future date a security that it either contemporaneously owns or has the right to acquire\nat no extra cost. If the price of the security has declined at the time the Fund is required to deliver the\nsecurity, the Fund will benefit from the difference in the price. If the price of the security has\nincreased, the Fund will be required to pay the difference. Swap Transactions: The Fund may enter into swap\ntransactions, including interest rate swap, credit default swap, NDF, and total return swap transactions.\nSwap transactions are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the\nother party based on the change in market value or level of a specified rate, index or asset. In return, the\nother party agrees to make payments to the first party based on the return of a different specified rate,\nindex or asset. Swap transactions will usually be done on a net basis, i.e., where the two parties make net\npayments with the Fund receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. The\nnet amount of the excess, if any, of the Fund's obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap\nis accrued on a daily basis and an amount of cash or equivalents having an aggregate value at least equal to\nthe accrued excess is maintained by the Fund. Swaps may be used in conjunction with other instruments to\noffset interest rate, currency or other underlying risks. For example, interest rate swaps may be offset\nwith \u201c caps, \u201d \u201c floors \u201d or \u201c collars. \u201d A \u201c cap \u201d is essentially a call option which places a limit on the\namount of floating rate interest that must be paid on a certain principal amount. A \u201c floor \u201d is essentially\na put option which places a limit on the minimum amount that would be paid on a certain principal amount. A\n\u201c collar \u201d is essentially a combination of a long cap and a short floor where the limits are set at\ndifferent levels. The use of swap transactions by the Fund entails certain risks, which may be different\nfrom, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the securities and other\ninvestments that are the referenced asset for the swap agreement. Swaps are highly specialized instruments\nthat require investment techniques, risk analyses, and tax planning different from those associated with\nstocks, bonds, and other traditional investments. The use of a swap requires an\n\n6\n\nunderstanding not only of the referenced asset, reference rate, or index, but also of the swap itself,\nwithout the benefit of observing the performance of the swap under all the possible market conditions.\nBecause some swap transactions have a leverage component, adverse changes in the value or level of the\nunderlying asset, reference rate, or index can result in a loss substantially greater than the amount\ninvested in the swap itself. Certain swaps have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of\nthe initial investment. Bilateral OTC transactions differ from exchange-traded or cleared derivatives\ntransactions in several respects. Bilateral OTC transactions are transacted directly with dealers and not\nwith a clearing corporation. Without the availability of a clearing corporation, bilateral OTC transaction\npricing is normally done by reference to information from market makers and/or available index data, which\ninformation is carefully monitored by the Adviser and verified in appropriate cases. As bilateral OTC\ntransactions are entered into directly with a dealer, there is a risk of nonperformance by the dealer as a\nresult of its insolvency or otherwise. Under regulations adopted by the CFTC and federal banking regulators\n( \u201c Margin Rules \u201d ), the Fund is required to post collateral (known as variation margin) to cover the mark-\nto-market exposure in respect of its uncleared swaps. The Margin Rules also mandate that collateral in the\nform of initial margin be posted to cover potential future exposure attributable to uncleared swap\ntransactions. In the event the Fund is required to post collateral in the form of initial margin or\nvariation margin in respect of its uncleared swap transactions, all such collateral will be posted with a\nthird party custodian pursuant to a triparty custody agreement between the Fund, its dealer counterparty and\nan unaffiliated custodian. The requirement to execute certain OTC derivatives contracts on exchanges or\nelectronic trading platforms called swap execution facilities ( \u201c SEFs \u201d ) may offer certain advantages over\ntraditional bilateral OTC trading, such as ease of execution, price transparency, increased liquidity and/or\nfavorable pricing. However, SEF trading may make it more difficult and costly for the Fund to enter into\nhighly tailored or customized transactions and may result in additional costs and risks. Market participants\nsuch as the Fund that execute derivatives contracts through a SEF, whether directly or through a broker\nintermediary, are required to submit to the jurisdiction of the SEF and comply with SEF and CFTC rules and\nregulations which impose, among other things disclosure and recordkeeping obligations. In addition, the Fund\nwill generally incur SEF or broker intermediary fees when it trades on a SEF. The Fund may also be required\nto indemnify the SEF or broker intermediary for any losses or costs that may result from the Fund's\ntransactions on the SEF. Total Return Swaps: The Fund may enter into total return swap transactions for\ninvestment purposes. Total return swaps are transactions in which one party agrees to make periodic payments\nbased on the change in market value of the underlying assets, which may include a specified security, basket\nof securities or security indexes during the specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a\nfixed or variable interest rate of the total return from other underlying assets. Total return swaps may be\nused to obtain exposure to a security or market without owning or taking physical custody of such security\nor market, including in cases in which there may be disadvantages associated with direct ownership of a\nparticular security. In a typical total return equity swap, payments made by the Fund or the counterparty\nare based on the total return of a particular reference asset or assets (such as an equity security, a\ncombination of such securities, or an index). That is, one party agrees to pay another party the return on a\nstock, basket of stocks, or stock index in return for a specified interest rate. By entering into an equity\nindex swap, for example, the index receiver can gain exposure to stocks making up the index of securities\nwithout actually purchasing those stocks. Total return swaps involve not only the risk associated with the\ninvestment in the underlying securities, but also the risk of the counterparty not fulfilling its\nobligations under the agreement. Credit Default Swaps: The Fund may enter into credit default swap\ntransactions for investment purposes. A credit default swap transaction may have as reference obligations\none or more securities that are not currently held by the Fund. The Fund may be either the protection buyer\nor protection seller in the transaction. Credit default swaps may also be structured based on the debt of a\nbasket of issuers, rather than a single issuer, and may be customized with respect to the default event that\ntriggers purchase or other factors. As a protection seller, the Fund would generally receive an upfront\npayment or a fixed rate of income throughout the term of the swap, which typically is between six months and\nthree years, provided that there is no credit event. If a credit event occurs, generally the protection\nseller must pay the protection buyer the full face amount of the reference obligations that may have little\nor no value. If the Fund were a protection buyer and no credit event occurred during the term of the swap,\nthe Fund would recover nothing if the swap were held through its termination date. However, if a credit\nevent occurred, the protection buyer may elect to receive the full notional value of the swap in exchange\nfor an equal face amount of the reference obligation that may have little or no value. Where the Fund is the\nprotection buyer, credit default swaps involve the risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its payment\nobligations to the Fund in the event of a default. The purchase of credit default swaps involves costs,\nwhich will reduce the Fund's return.\n\n7\n\nCurrency Swaps: The Fund may enter into currency swap transactions for investment purposes. Currency swaps\nare similar to interest rate swaps, except that they involve multiple currencies. The Fund may enter into a\ncurrency swap when it has exposure to one currency and desires exposure to a different currency. Typically,\nthe interest rates that determine the currency swap payments are fixed, although occasionally one or both\nparties may pay a floating rate of interest. Unlike an interest rate swap, however, the principal amounts\nare exchanged at the beginning of the contract and returned at the end of the contract. In addition to\npaying and receiving amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction, both sides will have to pay in\nfull on a periodic basis based upon the currency they have borrowed. Change in foreign exchange rates and\nchanges in interest rates, as described above, may negatively affect currency swaps. Interest Rate Swaps:\nThe Fund may enter into an interest rate swap in an effort to protect against declines in the value of fixed\nincome securities held by the Fund. In such an instance, the Fund may agree to pay a fixed rate (multiplied\nby a notional amount) while a counterparty agrees to pay a floating rate (multiplied by the same notional\namount). If interest rates rise, resulting in a diminution in the value of the Fund's portfolio, the Fund\nwould receive payments under the swap that would offset, in whole or in part, such diminution in value.\nOptions on Swaps: An option on a swap agreement, or a \u201c swaption, \u201d is a contract that gives a counterparty\nthe right (but not the obligation) to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten, extend, cancel or\notherwise modify an existing swap agreement, at some designated future time on specified terms. In return,\nthe purchaser pays a \u201c premium \u201d to the seller of the contract. The seller of the contract receives the\npremium and bears the risk of unfavorable changes on the underlying swap. The Fund may write (sell) and\npurchase put and call swaptions. The Fund may also enter into swaptions on either an asset-based or\nliability-based basis, depending on whether the Fund is hedging its assets or its liabilities. The Fund may\nwrite (sell) and purchase put and call swaptions to the same extent it may make use of standard options on\nsecurities or other instruments. The Fund may enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return\nor spread on a particular investment or portion of its holdings, as a duration management technique, to\nprotect against an increase in the price of securities the Fund anticipates purchasing at a later date, or\nfor any other purposes, such as for speculation to increase returns. Swaptions are generally subject to the\nsame risks involved in the Fund's use of options. Depending on the terms of the particular option agreement,\nthe Fund will generally incur a greater degree of risk when it writes a swaption than it will incur when it\npurchases a swaption. When the Fund purchases a swaption, it risks losing only the amount of the premium it\nhas paid should it decide to let the option expire unexercised. However, when the Fund writes a swaption,\nupon exercise of the option the Fund will become obligated according to the terms of the underlying\nagreement. Government Regulation: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201c Dodd-\nFrank Act \u201d ) that was signed into law on July 21, 2010 created a new statutory framework that\ncomprehensively regulated the over-the-counter ( \u201c OTC \u201d ) derivatives markets for the first time. Prior to\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, the OTC derivatives markets were traditionally traded on a bilateral basis (so-called \u201c\nbilateral OTC transactions \u201d ). Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain OTC derivatives transactions are now\nrequired to be centrally cleared and traded on SEFs. On October 28, 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 18f-4 (the \u201c\nDerivatives Rule \u201d ) under the 1940 Act which replaced prior SEC and staff guidance with an updated,\ncomprehensive framework for registered funds' use of derivatives. The Derivatives Rule permits the Fund to\nenter into derivatives transactions and certain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the\nissuance of \u201c senior securities \u201d under Section 18 of the 1940 Act. The Derivatives Rule requires the Fund\nto trade derivatives and certain other instruments that create future payment or delivery obligations\nsubject to a value-at-risk ( \u201c VaR \u201d ) leverage limit, develop and implement a derivatives risk management\nprogram and new testing requirements, and comply with new requirements related to board and SEC reporting.\nThese requirements apply unless the Fund qualifies as a \u201c limited derivatives user, \u201d as defined in the\nDerivatives Rule. Complying with the Derivatives Rule may increase the cost of the Fund's investments and\ncost of doing business, which could adversely affect investors. Other new regulations could adversely affect\nthe value, availability and performance of certain derivative instruments, may make them more costly, and\nmay limit or restrict their use by the Fund. Regulation Under the Commodity Exchange Act: The Fund intends\nto use commodity interests, such as futures, swaps and options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the\nCEA. The Fund may use exchange-traded futures and options on futures, together with positions in cash and\nmoney market instruments, to simulate full investment in its underlying Index. Exchange-traded futures and\noptions on futures contracts may not be currently available for an Index. Under such circumstances, the\nAdviser may seek to utilize other instruments that it believes to be correlated to the applicable Index\ncomponents or a subset of the components. An exclusion from the definition of the term \u201c commodity pool\noperator \u201d has been claimed with respect to each series of the Trust in accordance with Rule 4.5 such that\nregistration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA is not necessary.\n\n8\n\nRestrictions on Trading in Commodity Interests: The Fund reserves the right to engage in transactions\ninvolving futures, options thereon and swaps to the extent allowed by the CFTC regulations in effect from\ntime to time and in accordance with the Fund's policies. Certain additional risk factors related to\nderivatives are discussed below: Derivatives Risk: Under recently adopted rules by the CFTC, transactions in\nsome types of interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps on North American and European indices are\nrequired to be cleared. In addition, the CFTC may promulgate additional regulations that require clearing of\nother classes of swaps. In a cleared derivatives transaction (which includes futures, options on futures,\nand cleared swaps transactions), the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house (such as CME, ICE Clear Credit\nor LCH.Clearnet), rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of a clearing house and only\nmembers of a clearing house can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing members, who are futures commission merchants that are members of\nthe clearing houses and who have the appropriate regulatory approvals to engage in cleared derivatives\ntransactions. The Fund makes and receives payments owed under cleared derivatives transactions (including\nmargin payments) through its accounts at clearing members. Clearing members guarantee performance of their\nclients' obligations to the clearing house. In contrast to bilateral OTC transactions, clearing members\ngenerally can require termination of existing cleared derivatives transactions at any time and increases in\nmargin above the margin that it required at the beginning of a transaction. Clearing houses also have broad\nrights to increase margin requirements for existing transactions and to terminate transactions in accordance\nwith their rules. Any such increase or termination could interfere with the ability of the Fund to pursue\nits investment strategy. Also, the Fund is subject to execution risk if it enters into a derivatives\ntransaction that is required to be cleared (or that the Advisor expects to be cleared), and no clearing\nmember is willing or able to clear the transaction on the Fund's behalf. While the documentation in place\nbetween the Fund and its clearing members generally provides that the clearing members will accept for\nclearing all transactions submitted for clearing that are within credit limits specified by the clearing\nmembers in advance, the Fund could be subject to this execution risk if the Fund submits for clearing\ntransactions that exceed such credit limits, if the clearing house does not accept the transactions for\nclearing, or if the clearing members do not comply with their agreement to clear such transactions. In that\ncase, the transaction might have to be terminated, and the Fund could lose some or all of the benefit of any\nincrease in the value of the transaction after the time of the transaction. In addition, new regulations\ncould, among other things, restrict the Fund's ability to engage in, or increase the cost to the Fund of,\nderivatives transactions, for example, by making some types of derivatives no longer available to the Fund\nor increasing margin or capital requirements. If the Fund is not able to enter into a particular derivatives\ntransaction, the Fund's investment performance and risk profile could be adversely affected as a result.\nCounterparty Risk: Counterparty risk with respect to OTC derivatives may be affected by new regulations\npromulgated by the CFTC and SEC affecting the derivatives market. As described under \u201c Derivatives Risk \u201d\nabove, all futures and options on futures and some swap transactions are required to be cleared, and a party\nto a cleared derivatives transaction is subject to the credit risk of the clearing house and the clearing\nmember through which it holds its cleared derivatives position, rather than the credit risk of its original\ncounterparty to the derivative transaction. Clearing members are required to segregate all funds received\nfrom customers with respect to cleared derivatives transactions from the clearing member's proprietary\nassets. However, all funds and other property received by a clearing broker from its customers are generally\nheld by the clearing broker on a commingled basis in an omnibus account, and the clearing broker may also\ninvest those funds in certain instruments permitted under the applicable regulations. Also, the clearing\nmember transfers to the clearing house the amount of margin required by the clearing house for cleared\nderivatives transactions, which amounts are generally held in the relevant omnibus account at the clearing\nhouse for all customers of the clearing member. For commodities futures positions, the clearing house may\nuse all of the collateral held in the clearing member's omnibus account to meet a loss in that account,\nwithout regard to which customer in fact supplied that collateral. Accordingly, in addition to bearing the\ncredit risk of its clearing member, each customer to a futures transaction also bears \u201c fellow customer \u201d\nrisk from other customers of the clearing member. However, with respect to cleared swaps positions, recent\nregulations promulgated by the CFTC require that the clearing member notify the clearing house of the amount\nof initial margin provided by the clearing member to the clearing house that is attributable to each\ncustomer. Because margin in respect of cleared swaps must be earmarked for specific clearing member\ncustomers, the clearing house may not use the collateral of one customer to cover the obligations of another\ncustomer. However, if the clearing member does not provide accurate reporting, the Fund is subject to the\nrisk that a clearing house will use the Fund's assets held in an omnibus\n\n9\n\naccount at the clearing house to satisfy payment obligations of a defaulting customer of the clearing member\nto the clearing house. In addition, clearing members may generally choose to provide to the clearing house\nthe net amount of variation margin required for cleared swaps for all of its customers in the aggregate,\nrather than the gross amount for each customer. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS The Fund may take advantage of\nopportunities in the area of options and futures contracts, options on futures contracts, warrants, swaps\nand any other investments which are not presently contemplated for use by the Fund or which are not\ncurrently available but which may be developed, to the extent such opportunities are both consistent with\nthe Fund's investment objective and legally permissible for the Fund. Before entering into such transactions\nor making any such investment, the Fund will provide appropriate disclosure. HIGH YIELD SECURITIES\nInvestment in high yield securities (commonly known as \u201c junk \u201d bonds) generally provides greater income and\nincreased opportunity for capital appreciation than investments in higher quality securities, but they also\ntypically entail greater price volatility and credit risk. These high yield securities are regarded as\npredominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to meet principal and interest\npayments. Analysis of the creditworthiness of issuers of debt securities that are high yield may be more\ncomplex than for issuers of higher quality debt securities. In addition, high yield securities are often\nissued by smaller, less creditworthy companies or by highly leveraged (indebted) firms, but can also be\nissued by governments. Such issuers are generally less able than more financially stable issuers to make\nscheduled payments of interest and principal. The risks posed by securities issued under such circumstances\nare substantial. Investing in high yield debt securities involves risks that are greater than the risks of\ninvesting in higher quality debt securities. These risks include: (i) changes in credit status, including\nweaker overall credit conditions of issuers and risks of default; (ii) industry, market and economic risk;\nand (iii) greater price variability and credit risks of certain high yield securities such as zero coupon\nand payment-in-kind securities. While these risks provide the opportunity for maximizing return over time,\nthey may result in greater volatility of the value of the Fund than a fund that invests in higher-rated\nsecurities. Furthermore, the value of high yield securities may be more susceptible to real or perceived\nadverse economic, company or industry conditions than is the case for higher quality securities. The market\nvalues of certain of these lower-rated and unrated debt securities tend to reflect individual issuer\ndevelopments to a greater extent than do higher-rated securities which react primarily to fluctuations in\nthe general level of interest rates, and tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions than are higher-\nrated securities. Adverse market, credit or economic conditions could make it difficult at certain times to\nsell certain high yield securities held by the Fund. The secondary market on which high yield securities are\ntraded may be less liquid than the market for higher grade securities. Less liquidity in the secondary\ntrading market could adversely affect the price at which the Fund could sell a high yield security, and\ncould adversely affect the daily net asset value per share of the Fund. When secondary markets for high\nyield securities are less liquid than the market for higher grade securities, it may be more difficult to\nvalue the securities because there is less reliable, objective data available. The use of credit ratings as\na principal method of selecting high yield securities can involve certain risks. For example, credit ratings\nevaluate the safety of principal and interest payments, not the market value risk of high yield securities.\nAlso, credit rating agencies may fail to change credit ratings in a timely fashion to reflect events since\nthe security was last rated. ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS The Fund may invest in illiquid investments. The Fund may\nnot acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more\nthan 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment means any investment that the\nFund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or\nless without the sale or disposition significantly changing the market value of the investment. If illiquid\ninvestments exceed 15% of the Fund's net assets, certain remedial actions will be taken as required by Rule\n22e-4 under the 1940 Act and the Fund's policies and procedures.\n\n10\n\nINFLATION-PROTECTED OBLIGATIONS The Fund may invest in inflation-protected public obligations, commonly\nknown as \u201c TIPS, \u201d of the U.S. Treasury, as well as TIPS of major governments and emerging market countries,\nexcluding the United States. TIPS are a type of security issued by a government that are designed to provide\ninflation protection to investors. TIPS are income-generating instruments whose interest and principal\npayments are adjusted for inflation\u2014a sustained increase in prices that erodes the purchasing power of\nmoney. The inflation adjustment, which is typically applied monthly to the principal of the bond, follows a\ndesignated inflation index, such as the Consumer Price Index. A fixed coupon rate is applied to the\ninflation-adjusted principal so that as inflation rises or falls, both the principal value and the interest\npayments will increase or decrease. This can provide investors with a hedge against inflation, as it helps\npreserve the purchasing power of an investment. Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation-\nprotected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixed-rate bonds. INVESTMENT COMPANIES The\nFund may invest in the securities of other investment companies, including affiliated funds and money market\nfunds, subject to applicable limitations under Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Section\n12(d)(1), the Fund may invest in the securities of another investment company (the \u201c acquired company \u201d )\nprovided that the Fund, immediately after such purchase or acquisition, does not own in the aggregate: (i)\nmore than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company; (ii) securities issued by the\nacquired company having an aggregate value in excess of 5% of the value of the total assets of the Fund; or\n(iii) securities issued by the acquired company and all other investment companies (other than Treasury\nstock of the Fund) having an aggregate value in excess of 10% of the value of the total assets of the Fund.\nTo the extent allowed by law, regulation, and/or the Fund's investment restrictions, the Fund may invest its\nassets in securities of investment companies, including affiliated funds and/or money market funds, in\nexcess of the limits discussed above. If the Fund invests in and, thus, is a shareholder of, another\ninvestment company, the Fund's shareholders will indirectly bear the Fund's proportionate share of the fees\nand expenses paid by such other investment company, including advisory fees, in addition to both the\nmanagement fees payable directly by the Fund to the Fund's own investment adviser and the other expenses\nthat the Fund bears directly in connection with the Fund's own operations. LENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES The\nFund may lend portfolio securities to certain creditworthy borrowers in U.S. and non-U.S. markets in an\namount not to exceed 40% of the value of its net assets. The borrowers provide collateral that is marked to\nmarket daily in an amount at least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. The Fund may\nterminate a loan at any time and obtain the securities loaned. The Fund receives the value of any interest\nor cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned securities. The Fund cannot vote proxies for securities\non loan, but may recall loans to vote proxies if a material issue affecting the Fund's economic interest in\nthe investment is to be voted upon. Efforts to recall such securities promptly may be unsuccessful,\nespecially for foreign securities or thinly traded securities. Distributions received on loaned securities\nin lieu of dividend payments (i.e., substitute payments) would not be considered qualified dividend income.\nWith respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based\non the amount of cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the\nreinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash,\nthe Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the\nloaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain high quality short-term instruments\neither directly on behalf of the lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or funds, which may\ninclude those managed by the Adviser. The Fund could lose money due to a decline in the value of collateral\nprovided for loaned securities or any investments made with cash collateral. Certain non-cash collateral or\ninvestments made with cash collateral may have a greater risk of loss than other non-cash collateral or\ninvestments. The Fund may pay a portion of the interest or fees earned from securities lending to a borrower\nas described above, and to one or more securities lending agents approved by the Board of Trustees of the\nTrust (the \u201c Board \u201d ) who administer the lending program for the Fund in accordance with guidelines\napproved by the Board. In such capacity, the lending agent provides the following services to the Fund in\nconnection with the Fund's securities lending activities: (i) locating borrowers among an approved list of\nprospective borrowers; (ii) causing the delivery of loaned securities from the Fund to borrowers; (iii)\nmonitoring the value of loaned securities, the value of collateral received, and other lending parameters;\n(iv) seeking additional collateral, as necessary, from borrowers; (v) receiving and holding collateral from\nborrowers, and facilitating the\n\n11\n\ninvestment and reinvestment of all or substantially all cash collateral in an investment vehicle designated\nby the Fund; (vi) returning collateral to borrowers; (vii) facilitating substitute dividend, interest, and\nother distribution payments to the Fund from borrowers; (viii) negotiating the terms of each loan of\nsecurities, including but not limited to the amount of any loan premium, and monitoring the terms of\nsecurities loan agreements with prospective borrowers for consistency with the requirements of the Fund's\nSecurities Lending Authorization Agreement; (ix) selecting securities, including amounts (percentages), to\nbe loaned; (x) recordkeeping and accounting servicing; and (xi) arranging for return of loaned securities to\nthe Fund in accordance with the terms of the Securities Lending Authorization Agreement. State Street Bank\nand Trust Company ( \u201c State Street \u201d ), an affiliate of the Trust, has been approved by the Board to serve\nas securities lending agent for the Fund and the Trust has entered into an agreement with State Street for\nsuch services. Among other matters, the Trust has agreed to indemnify State Street for certain liabilities.\nState Street has received an order of exemption from the SEC under Sections 17(a) and 12(d)(1) under the\n1940 Act to serve as the lending agent for affiliated investment companies such as the Trust and to invest\nthe cash collateral received from loan transactions to be invested in an affiliated cash collateral fund.\nSecurities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses\nresulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process especially so in certain international\nmarkets such as Taiwan), \u201c gap \u201d risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral\nreinvestments and the fees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), risk of loss of collateral, credit,\nlegal, counterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, the Fund would be\nsubject to the risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or\nto a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return the Fund's\nsecurities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the\ncollateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated,\nplus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities. Although State Street has agreed\nto provide the Fund with indemnification in the event of a borrower default, the Fund is still exposed to\nthe risk of losses in the event a borrower does not return the Fund's securities as agreed. For example,\ndelays in recovery of lent securities may cause the Fund to lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a\ndesirable price. LEVERAGING While the Fund does not anticipate doing so, the Fund may borrow money in an\namount greater than 5% of the value of the Fund's total assets. However, under normal circumstances, the\nFund will not borrow money from a bank in an amount greater than 10% of the value of the Fund's total\nassets. Borrowing for investment purposes is one form of leverage. Leveraging investments, by purchasing\nsecurities with borrowed money, is a speculative technique that increases investment risk, but also\nincreases investment opportunity. Because substantially all of the Fund's assets will fluctuate in value,\nwhereas the interest obligations on borrowings may be fixed, the NAV of the Fund will increase more when\nsuch Fund's portfolio assets increase in value and decrease more when the Fund's portfolio assets decrease\nin value than would otherwise be the case. Moreover, interest costs on borrowings may fluctuate with\nchanging market rates of interest and may partially offset or exceed the returns on the borrowed funds.\nMUNICIPAL SECURITIES Municipal securities are securities issued by states, municipalities and other\npolitical subdivisions, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities of states and multi-state agencies or\nauthorities. Municipal securities share the attributes of debt/fixed income securities in general, but are\ngenerally issued by states, municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies, authorities and\ninstrumentalities of states and multi-state agencies or authorities. The municipal securities which the\nFunds may purchase include general obligation bonds and limited obligation bonds (or revenue bonds),\nincluding industrial development bonds issued pursuant to former federal tax law. General obligation bonds\nare obligations involving the credit of an issuer possessing taxing power and are payable from such issuer's\ngeneral revenues and not from any particular source. Limited obligation bonds are payable only from the\nrevenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a\nspecial excise or other specific revenue source. Tax-exempt industrial development bonds generally are also\nrevenue bonds and thus are not payable from the issuer's general revenues. The credit and quality of\nindustrial development bonds are usually related to the credit of the corporate user of the facilities.\nPayment of interest on and repayment of principal of such bonds is the responsibility of the corporate user\n(and/or any guarantor). Some longer-term municipal securities give the investor the right to \u201c put \u201d or sell\nthe security at par (face value) within a specified number of days following the investor's request\u2014usually\none to seven days. This demand feature enhances a security's liquidity by shortening its effective maturity\nand enables it to trade at a price equal to or very close to par. If a\n\n12\n\ndemand feature terminates prior to being exercised, the Fund would hold the longer-term security, which\ncould experience substantially more volatility. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for\ntaxable bonds. This means that it may be harder to buy and sell municipal securities, especially on short\nnotice, than non-municipal securities. There may also be less information available on the financial\ncondition of issuers of municipal securities than for public corporations. This means that it may be harder\nto buy and sell municipal securities, especially on short notice, and municipal securities may be more\ndifficult for the Funds to value accurately than securities of public corporations. A Fund that invests a\nsignificant portion of its portfolio in municipal securities may have greater exposure to liquidity risk\nthan a fund that invests in non-municipal securities. In addition, the municipal securities market is\ngenerally characterized as a buy and hold investment strategy. As a result, the accessibility of municipal\nsecurities in the market is generally greater closer to the original date of issue of the securities and\nlessens as the securities move further away from such issuance date. Municipal securities are subject to\ncredit and market risk. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate more with changes in\nmarket interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to\nfluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues. Prices and yields on municipal securities are\ndependent on a variety of factors, including general money-market conditions, the financial condition of the\nissuer, general conditions of the municipal security market, the size of a particular offering, the maturity\nof the obligation and the rating of the issue. A number of these factors, including the ratings of\nparticular issues, are subject to change from time to time. Information about the financial condition of an\nissuer of municipal securities may not be as extensive as that which is made available by corporations whose\nsecurities are publicly traded. As a result, municipal securities may be more difficult to value than\nsecurities of public corporations. Obligations of issuers of municipal securities are subject to the\nprovisions of bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors. Congress\nor state legislatures may seek to extend the time for payment of principal or interest, or both, or to\nimpose other constraints upon enforcement of such obligations. In addition, municipal securities are subject\nto the risk that their tax treatment could be changed by Congress or state legislatures, thereby affecting\nthe value of outstanding municipal securities. There is also the possibility that as a result of litigation\nor other conditions, the power or ability of issuers to meet their obligations for the payment of interest\nand principal on their municipal securities may be materially affected or their obligations may be found to\nbe invalid or unenforceable. Such litigation or conditions may from time to time have the effect of\nintroducing uncertainties in the market for municipal securities or certain segments thereof, or of\nmaterially affecting the credit risk with respect to particular bonds. Adverse economic, business, legal or\npolitical developments might affect all or a substantial portion of the Fund's municipal securities in the\nsame manner. Municipal Leases and Certificates of Participation: Also included within the general category\nof municipal securities are municipal leases, certificates of participation in such lease obligations or\ninstallment purchase contract obligations (hereinafter collectively called \u201c Municipal Lease Obligations \u201d )\nof municipal authorities or entities. Although a Municipal Lease Obligation does not constitute a general\nobligation of the municipality for which the municipality's taxing power is pledged, a Municipal Lease\nObligation is ordinarily backed by the municipality's covenant to budget for, appropriate and make the\npayments due under the Municipal Lease Obligation. However, certain Municipal Lease Obligations contain \u201c\nnon-appropriation \u201d clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease or\ninstallment purchase payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly\nbasis. In the case of a \u201c non-appropriation \u201d lease, the Fund's ability to recover under the lease in the\nevent of non-appropriation or default will be limited solely to the repossession of the leased property,\nwithout recourse to the general credit of the lessee, and disposition or releasing of the property might\nprove difficult. Municipal Insurance: A municipal security may be covered by insurance that guarantees the\nbond's scheduled payment of interest and repayment of principal. This type of insurance may be obtained by\neither (i) the issuer at the time the bond is issued (primary market insurance), or (ii) another party after\nthe bond has been issued (secondary market insurance). Both primary and secondary market insurance guarantee\ntimely and scheduled repayment of all principal and payment of all interest on a municipal security in the\nevent of default by the issuer, and cover a municipal security to its maturity, enhancing its credit quality\nand value. Municipal security insurance does not insure against market fluctuations or fluctuations in the\nFund's share price. In addition, a municipal security insurance policy will not cover: (i) repayment of a\nmunicipal security before maturity (redemption), (ii) prepayment or payment of an acceleration premium\n(except for a mandatory sinking fund redemption) or\n\n13\n\nany other provision of a bond indenture that advances the maturity of the bond, or (iii) nonpayment of\nprincipal or interest caused by negligence or bankruptcy of the paying agent. A mandatory sinking fund\nredemption may be a provision of a municipal security issue whereby part of the municipal security issue may\nbe retired before maturity. Because a significant portion of the municipal securities issued and outstanding\nis insured by a small number of insurance companies, an event involving one or more of these insurance\ncompanies could have a significant adverse effect on the value of the securities insured by that insurance\ncompany and on the municipal markets as a whole. Municipal Market Disruption Risk: The value of municipal\nsecurities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation\ninvolving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities holders in the event of\na bankruptcy. Proposals to restrict or eliminate the federal income tax exemption for interest on municipal\nsecurities are introduced before Congress from time to time. Proposals also may be introduced before state\nlegislatures that would affect the state tax treatment of a municipal fund's distributions. If such\nproposals were enacted, the availability of municipal securities and the value of any municipal securities\nheld by the Fund would be affected. Municipal bankruptcies are relatively rare, and certain provisions of\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code governing such bankruptcies are unclear and remain untested. Further, the\napplication of state law to municipal issuers could produce varying results among the states or among\nmunicipal securities issuers within a state. These legal uncertainties could affect the municipal securities\nmarket generally, certain specific segments of the market, or the relative credit quality of particular\nsecurities. Any of these effects could have a significant impact on the prices of some or all of the\nmunicipal securities held by the Fund. OTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS The Fund may invest in short-term\ninstruments, including money market instruments, (including money market funds advised by the Adviser), cash\nand cash equivalents, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market\ninstruments are generally short-term investments that may include but are not limited to: (i) shares of\nmoney market funds (including those advised by the Adviser); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii)\nnegotiable certificates of deposit ( \u201c CDs \u201d ), bankers' acceptances, fixed time deposits and other\nobligations of U.S. and foreign banks (including foreign branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial\npaper rated at the date of purchase \u201c Prime-1 \u201d by Moody's Investors Service ( \u201c Moody's \u201d ) or \u201c A-1 \u201d by\nS&P Global Ratings ( \u201c S&P \u201d ), or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by the Adviser; (v) non-\nconvertible corporate debt securities (e.g., bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of\npurchase of not more than 397 days and that present minimal credit risk; and (vi) short-term U.S. dollar-\ndenominated obligations of foreign banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of the Adviser, are\nof comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks which may be purchased by the Fund. Any of these\ninstruments may be purchased on a current or a forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable\ndeposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers'\nacceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international\ntransactions. Money market instruments also include shares of money market funds. The SEC and other\ngovernment agencies continue to review the regulation of money market funds. The SEC has adopted changes to\nthe rules that govern money market funds over the years, most recently in July 2023. Legislative\ndevelopments may also affect money market funds. These changes and developments may affect the investment\nstrategies, performance, yield, operating expenses and continued viability of a money market fund. PREFERRED\nSECURITIES Preferred securities pay fixed or adjustable rate interest or dividends to investors, and are\ngenerally senior to common stock, but may be subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's\ncapital structure and therefore may be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments. There is\nno assurance that interest payments, dividends or distributions on the preferred securities in which the\nFund invests will be declared or otherwise made payable. In the case of preferred stock, in order to be\npayable, distributions on preferred securities must be declared by the issuer's board of directors. The\nmarket value of preferred securities may be affected by favorable and unfavorable changes impacting\ncompanies in the utilities and financial services sectors, which are prominent issuers of preferred\nsecurities, and by actual and anticipated changes in tax laws. Because the claim on an issuer's earnings\nrepresented by preferred securities may become onerous when interest rates fall below the rate payable on\nsuch securities, the issuer may redeem the securities. Thus, in declining interest rate environments in\nparticular, the Fund's holdings of higher rate-paying fixed rate preferred securities may be reduced and the\nFund would be unable to acquire securities paying comparable rates with the redemption proceeds.\n\n14\n\nPRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND RESTRICTED SECURITIES The Fund may invest in securities that are purchased in private\nplacements and, accordingly, are subject to restrictions on resale as a matter of contract or under federal\nsecurities laws. While such private placements may offer attractive opportunities for investment not\notherwise available on the open market, the securities so purchased are often \u201c restricted securities, \u201d\ni.e., securities which cannot be sold to the public without registration under the Securities Act or the\navailability of an exemption from registration (such as Rules 144 or 144A), or which are not readily\nmarketable because they are subject to other legal or contractual delays in or restrictions on resale.\nGenerally speaking, restricted securities may be sold only to qualified institutional buyers, or in a\nprivately negotiated transaction to a limited number of purchasers, or in limited quantities after they have\nbeen held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met pursuant to an exemption from\nregistration, or in a public offering for which a registration statement is in effect under the Securities\nAct. Because there may be relatively few potential purchasers for such investments, especially under adverse\nmarket or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer,\nthe Fund could find it more difficult to sell such securities when the Adviser believes it advisable to do\nso or may be able to sell such securities only at prices lower than if such securities were more widely\nheld. Market quotations for such securities are generally less readily available than for publicly traded\nsecurities. The absence of a trading market can make it difficult to ascertain a market value for such\nsecurities for purposes of computing the Fund's net asset value, and the judgment of the Adviser may at\ntimes play a greater role in valuing these securities than in the case of publicly traded securities.\nDisposing of such securities, which may be illiquid investments, can involve time-consuming negotiation and\nlegal expenses, and it may be difficult or impossible for the Fund to sell them promptly at an acceptable\nprice. The Fund may have to bear the extra expense of registering such securities for resale and the risk of\nsubstantial delay in effecting such registration. The Fund may be deemed to be an \u201c underwriter \u201d for\npurposes of the Securities Act when selling restricted securities to the public, and in such event the Fund\nmay be liable to purchasers of such securities if the registration statement prepared by the issuer, or the\nprospectus forming a part of it, is materially inaccurate or misleading. RATINGS An investment grade rating\nmeans the security or issuer is rated investment grade by Moody's, S&P, Fitch Ratings, Inc. ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ),\nDominion Bond Rating Service Limited, or another credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized\nstatistical rating organization by the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by the\nAdviser. Subsequent to purchase by the Fund, a rated security may cease to be rated or its investment grade\nrating may be reduced below an investment grade rating. Bonds rated lower than Baa3 by Moody's or BBB- by\nS&P or Fitch are below investment grade quality and are obligations of issuers that are considered\npredominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal\naccording to the terms of the obligation and, therefore, carry greater investment risk, including the\npossibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and increased market price volatility. Such securities ( \u201c\nlower rated securities \u201d ) are commonly referred to as \u201c junk \u201d bonds and are subject to a substantial\ndegree of credit risk. Lower rated securities are often issued by smaller, less creditworthy companies or by\nhighly leveraged (indebted) firms, which are generally less able than more financially stable firms to make\nscheduled payments of interest and principal. The risks posed by securities issued under such circumstances\nare substantial. Bonds rated below investment-grade tend to be less marketable than higher-quality bonds\nbecause the market for them is less broad. The market for unrated bonds is even narrower. See \u201c HIGH YIELD\nSECURITIES \u201d above for more information relating to the risks associated with investing in lower rated\nsecurities, or Appendix A for more information on the ratings of debt instruments. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS The\nFund may invest in repurchase agreements with commercial banks, brokers or dealers to generate income from\nits excess cash balances and to invest securities lending cash collateral. A repurchase agreement is an\nagreement under which the Fund acquires a financial instrument (e.g., a security issued by the U.S.\ngovernment or an agency thereof, a banker's acceptance or a certificate of deposit) from a seller, subject\nto resale to the seller at an agreed upon price and date (normally, the next Business Day\u2014as defined below).\nA repurchase agreement may be considered a loan collateralized by securities. The resale price reflects an\nagreed upon interest rate effective for the period the instrument is held by the Fund and is unrelated to\nthe interest rate on the underlying instrument.\n\n15\n\nIn these repurchase agreement transactions, the securities acquired by the Fund (including accrued interest\nearned thereon) must have a total value in excess of the value of the repurchase agreement and are held by\nthe Custodian until repurchased. No more than an aggregate of 15% of the Fund's net assets will be invested\nin illiquid investments, including repurchase agreements having maturities longer than seven days and\nsecurities subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale, or for which there are no readily\navailable market quotations. The use of repurchase agreements involves certain risks. For example, if the\nother party to the agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying security at a time when\nthe value of the security has declined, the Fund may incur a loss upon disposition of the security. If the\nother party to the agreement becomes insolvent and subject to liquidation or reorganization under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code or other laws, a court may determine that the underlying security is collateral for a loan\nby the Fund not within the control of the Fund and, therefore, the Fund may not be able to substantiate its\ninterest in the underlying security and may be deemed an unsecured creditor of the other party to the\nagreement. REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS The Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements, which\ninvolve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date\nand interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. The securities purchased with the funds\nobtained from the agreement and securities collateralizing the agreement will have maturity dates no later\nthan the repayment date. Generally the effect of such transactions is that the Fund can recover all or most\nof the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase\nagreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated with those\nsecurities. Such transactions are only advantageous if the Fund has an opportunity to earn a greater rate of\ninterest on the cash derived from these transactions than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of\ncash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest\nrequired to be paid may not always be available and the Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique\nonly when the Adviser believes it will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements\nmay exaggerate any interim increase or decrease in the value of the Fund's assets. The Fund may enter into\nreverse repurchase agreements if it either meets the relevant asset coverage requirements of Section 18 of\nthe 1940 Act for senior securities representing indebtedness, or elects to treat such arrangements as\nderivatives transactions under the Derivatives Rule. The Fund does not expect to engage, under normal\ncircumstances, in reverse repurchase agreements with respect to more than 10% of its total assets. U.S.\nGOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS U.S. Government obligations are a type of bond. U.S. Government obligations include\nsecurities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government, its agencies or\ninstrumentalities. One type of U.S. Government obligation, U.S. Treasury obligations, are backed by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. Treasury and differ only in their interest rates, maturities, and times of\nissuance. U.S. Treasury bills have initial maturities of one-year or less; U.S. Treasury notes have initial\nmaturities of one to ten years; and U.S. Treasury bonds generally have initial maturities of greater than\nten years. Other U.S. Government obligations are issued or guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of\nthe U.S. Government including, but not limited to, Federal National Mortgage Association ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ),\nthe Government National Mortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d ), the Small Business Administration, the\nFederal Farm Credit Administration, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( \u201c Freddie Mac \u201d ), the\nFederal Home Loan Banks ( \u201c FHLB \u201d ), Banks for Cooperatives (including the Central Bank for Cooperatives),\nthe Federal Land Banks, the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Export-\nImport Bank of the United States, the Commodity Credit Corporation, the Federal Financing Bank, the Student\nLoan Marketing Association, the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage\nCorporation (Farmer Mac). Some obligations issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and\ninstrumentalities, including, for example, Ginnie Mae pass-through certificates, are supported by the full\nfaith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. Other obligations issued by or guaranteed by federal agencies, such\nas those securities issued by Fannie Mae, are supported by the discretionary authority of the U.S.\nGovernment to purchase certain obligations of the federal agency, while other obligations issued by or\nguaranteed by federal agencies, such as those of the Federal Home Loan Banks, are supported by the right of\nthe issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury. While the U.S. Government provides financial support to such\nU.S. Government-sponsored federal agencies, no assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will always\ndo so, since the U.S. Government is not so obligated by law.\n\n16\n\nIn September 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, placing the\ntwo federal instrumentalities in conservatorship. Under the terms of the takeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed\nto acquire $1 billion of senior preferred stock of each instrumentality and obtained warrants for the\npurchase of common stock of each instrumentality. Under these Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements ( \u201c\nSPAs \u201d ), the U.S. Treasury has pledged to provide a limited amount of capital per instrumentality as\nneeded, including the contribution of cash capital to the instrumentalities in the event their liabilities\nexceed their assets. In May 2009, the U.S. Treasury increased its maximum commitment to each instrumentality\nunder the SPAs from $100 billion to $200 billion per instrumentality. In December 2009, the U.S. Treasury\namended the SPAs to provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with some additional flexibility to meet the\nrequirement to reduce their mortgage portfolios. Also in December 2009, the U.S. Treasury further amended\nthe SPAs to allow the cap on the U.S. Treasury's funding commitment to increase as necessary to accommodate\nany cumulative reduction in Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's net worth through the end of 2012. On August 17,\n2012, the U.S. Treasury announced that it was again amending the SPAs to terminate the requirement that\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac each pay a 10% dividend annually on all amounts received under the funding\ncommitment. Instead, they were required to transfer to the U.S. Treasury on a quarterly basis all profits\nearned during a quarter that exceeded a capital reserve amount of $3 billion. On September 30, 2019, the\nU.S. Treasury announced amendments to the SPAs permitting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to maintain capital\nreserves of $25 billion and $20 billion, respectively. It is believed that the amendment puts Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac in a better position to service their debt because the companies no longer have to borrow from\nthe U.S. Treasury to make fixed dividend payments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the subject of several\ncontinuing class action lawsuits and investigations by federal regulators over certain accounting,\ndisclosure or corporate governance matters, which (along with any resulting financial restatements) may\nadversely affect the guaranteeing entities. Importantly, the future of the entities is in serious question\nas the U.S. government reportedly is considering multiple options, ranging from nationalization,\nprivatization, consolidation, or abolishment of the entities. VARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES Variable\nrate securities are instruments issued or guaranteed by entities such as (1) U.S. Government, or an agency\nor instrumentality thereof, (2) states, municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies,\nauthorities and instrumentalities or states and multi-state agencies or authorities, (3) corporations, (4)\nfinancial institutions, (5) insurance companies or (6) trusts that have a rate of interest subject to\nadjustment at regular intervals but less frequently than annually. A variable rate security provides for the\nautomatic establishment of a new interest rate on set dates. Variable rate obligations whose interest is\nreadjusted no less frequently than annually will be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining\nuntil the next readjustment of the interest rate. The Fund may also purchase floating rate securities. A\nfloating rate security provides for the automatic adjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified\ninterest rate changes. Interest rates on these securities are ordinarily tied to, and are a percentage of, a\nwidely recognized interest rate, such as the yield on 90-day U.S. Treasury bills or the prime rate of a\nspecified bank. These rates may change as often as twice daily. Generally, changes in interest rates will\nhave a smaller effect on the market value of variable and fixed rate floating rate securities than on the\nmarket value of comparable fixed rate fixed income obligations. Thus, investing in variable and fixed rate\nfloating rate securities generally allows less opportunity for capital appreciation and depreciation than\ninvesting in comparable fixed rate fixed income securities. VARIABLE RATE DEMAND OBLIGATIONS Variable rate\ndemand obligations ( \u201c VRDOs \u201d ) are short-term tax-exempt fixed income instruments whose yield is reset on\na periodic basis. VRDO securities tend to be issued with long maturities of up to 30 or 40 years; however,\nthey are considered short-term instruments because they include a put feature which coincides with the\nperiodic yield reset. For example, a VRDO whose yield resets weekly will have a put feature that is\nexercisable upon seven days' notice. VRDOs are put back to a bank or other entity that serves as a liquidity\nprovider, who then tries to resell the VRDOs or, if unable to resell, holds them in its own inventory. VRDOs\nare generally supported by either a Letter of Credit or a Stand-by Bond Purchase Agreement to provide credit\nenhancement.\n\n17\n\nWHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued basis. Delivery of and payment for\nthese securities may take place as long as a month or more after the date of the purchase commitment. The\nvalue of these securities is subject to market fluctuation during this period, and no income accrues to the\nFund until settlement takes place. When entering into a when-issued transaction, the Fund will rely on the\nother party to consummate the transaction; if the other party fails to do so, the Fund may be disadvantaged.\nSecurities purchased on a when-issued basis and held by the Fund are subject to changes in market value\nbased upon actual or perceived changes in the level of interest rates. Generally, the value of such\nsecurities will fluctuate inversely to changes in interest rates \u2014 i.e., they will appreciate in value when\ninterest rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise. Therefore, if the Fund purchases\nsecurities on a \u201c when-issued \u201d basis, there may be a greater possibility of fluctuation in the Fund's NAV.\nSpecial Considerations and Risks A discussion of the risks associated with an investment in the Fund is\ncontained in the Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the\nProspectus. GENERAL Investment in the Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund's\nportfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of\nthe portfolio securities, the value of securities generally and other factors. An investment in the Fund\nshould also be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in securities, including\nthe risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of the\nsecurities markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio\nsecurities and thus in the value of Shares). Securities are susceptible to general market fluctuations and\nto volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers\nchange. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors including expectations\nregarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic\nexpansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises. Securities of\nissuers traded on exchanges may be suspended on certain exchanges by the issuers themselves, by an exchange\nor by government authorities. The likelihood of such suspensions may be higher for securities of issuers in\nemerging or less-developed market countries than in countries with more developed markets. Trading\nsuspensions may be applied from time to time to the securities of individual issuers for reasons specific to\nthat issuer, or may be applied broadly by exchanges or governmental authorities in response to market\nevents. Suspensions may last for significant periods of time, during which trading in the securities and\ninstruments that reference the securities, such as participatory notes (or \u201c P-notes \u201d ) or other derivative\ninstruments, may be halted. The principal trading market for some of the securities in an Index may be in\nthe over-the-counter market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend on\nwhether dealers will make a market in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made\nor maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold\nand the value of the Fund's Shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for the Fund's portfolio\nsecurities are limited or absent or if bid/ask spreads are wide. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RISK An investment in\nthe Fund may be subject to a number of actual or potential conflicts of interest. For example, the Adviser\nor its affiliates may provide services to the Fund, such as securities lending agency services, custodial,\nadministrative, bookkeeping, and accounting services, transfer agency and shareholder servicing, securities\nbrokerage services, and other services for which the Fund would compensate the Adviser and/or such\naffiliates. The Fund may invest in other pooled investment vehicles sponsored, managed, or otherwise\naffiliated with the Adviser. There is no assurance that the rates at which the Fund pays fees or expenses to\nthe Adviser or its affiliates, or the terms on which it enters into transactions with the Adviser or its\naffiliates, will be the most favorable available in the market generally or as favorable as the rates the\nAdviser makes available to other clients. Because of its financial interest, the Adviser may have an\nincentive to enter into transactions or arrangements on behalf of the Fund with itself or its affiliates in\ncircumstances where it might not have done so in the absence of that interest.\n\n18\n\nCONTINUOUS OFFERING The method by which Creation Units of Shares are created and traded may raise certain\nissues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units of Shares are issued and sold by the\nTrust on an ongoing basis, at any point a \u201c distribution, \u201d as such term is used in the Securities Act, may\noccur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on\nthe circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which could\nrender them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of\nthe Securities Act. For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if\nit takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent\nShares, and sells such Shares directly to customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of\nnew Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for Shares. A\ndetermination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act must take into account all\nthe facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the\nparticular case, and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the\nactivities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should also note that\ndealers who are not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are effecting transactions in Shares, whether or not participating\nin the distribution of Shares, are generally required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the\nprospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act is not available in respect of such\ntransactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus-delivery obligation\nwith respect to Shares of the Fund are reminded that under Securities Act Rule 153, a prospectus-delivery\nobligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale\non the Exchange is satisfied by the fact that the Fund's Prospectus is available at the Exchange upon\nrequest. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is only available with respect to\ntransactions on an exchange. SSGA or its affiliates (the \u201c Selling Shareholder \u201d ) may purchase Creation\nUnits through a broker-dealer to \u201c seed \u201d (in whole or in part) the Fund as it is launched, or may purchase\nshares from broker-dealers or other investors that have previously provided \u201c seed \u201d for the Fund when it\nwas launched or otherwise in secondary market transactions, and because the Selling Shareholder may be\ndeemed an affiliate of the Fund, the Shares are being registered to permit the resale of these shares from\ntime to time after purchase. The Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling\nShareholders of these Shares. The Selling Shareholder intends to sell all or a portion of the Shares owned\nby it and offered hereby from time to time directly or through one or more broker-dealers, and may also\nhedge such positions. The Shares may be sold on any national securities exchange on which the Shares may be\nlisted or quoted at the time of sale, in the over-the-counter market or in transactions other than on these\nexchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices\ndetermined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected in transactions, which\nmay involve cross or block transactions. The Selling Shareholder may also loan or pledge Shares to broker-\ndealers that in turn may sell such Shares, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The Selling\nShareholder may also enter into options or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial\ninstitutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-\ndealer or other financial institution of Shares, which Shares such broker-dealer or other financial\ninstitution may resell. The Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the\ndistribution of Shares may be deemed to be \u201c underwriters \u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the\nSecurities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions paid to any such broker-dealer\nor agent and any profit on the resale of the Shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting\ncommissions or discounts under the Securities Act. The Selling Shareholder who may be deemed an \u201c\nunderwriter \u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act will be subject to the applicable\nprospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. COUNTERPARTY RISK Counterparty risk with respect to\nderivatives has been and may continue to be affected by new rules and regulations affecting the derivatives\nmarket. Some derivatives transactions are required to be centrally cleared, and a party to a cleared\nderivatives transaction is subject to the credit risk of the clearing house and the clearing member through\nwhich it holds its cleared position, rather than the credit risk of its original counterparty to the\nderivatives transaction. Credit risk of\n\n19\n\nmarket participants with respect to derivatives that are centrally cleared is concentrated in a few clearing\nhouses, and it is not clear how an insolvency proceeding of a clearing house would be conducted, what effect\nthe insolvency proceeding would have on any recovery by the Fund, and what impact an insolvency of a\nclearing house would have on the financial system more generally. FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS There can\nbe no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular futures contract or option at\nany specific time. Thus, it may not be possible to close a futures or options position. In the event of\nadverse price movements, the Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its\nrequired margin. In such situations, if the Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio\nsecurities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition,\nthe Fund may be required to make delivery of the instruments underlying futures contracts it has sold. The\nFund will minimize the risk that it will be unable to close out a futures or options contract by only\nentering into futures and options for which there appears to be a liquid secondary market. The risk of loss\nin trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (e.g., selling uncovered index\nfutures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan to use futures and options contracts,\nwhen available, in this manner. The risk of a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured\ndue to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures\ncontract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to the size of a\nrequired margin deposit. The Fund, however, may utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed\nto limit its risk exposure to that which is comparable to what it would have incurred through direct\ninvestment in securities. Utilization of futures transactions by the Fund involves the risk of imperfect or\neven negative correlation to its benchmark Index if the index underlying the futures contracts differs from\nthe benchmark Index or if the futures contracts do not track the benchmark Index as expected. There is also\nthe risk of loss by the Fund of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom the Fund\nhas an open position in the futures contract or option. Certain financial futures exchanges limit the amount\nof fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The \u201c daily price\nfluctuation limit \u201d or \u201c daily limit \u201d establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract\nmay vary either up or down from the previous day's settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once\nthe daily limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, generally no trades may be made on that\nday at a price beyond that limit. The daily limit governs only price movement during a particular trading\nday and therefore does not limit potential losses, because the limit may prevent the liquidation of\nunfavorable positions. Futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several\nconsecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures\npositions and subjecting some futures traders to substantial losses. RISKS OF SWAP AGREEMENTS Swap\nagreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on its obligations. If such a\ndefault occurs, the Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the\ntransaction, but such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws which could affect the\nFund's rights as a creditor. The use of interest-rate and index swaps is a highly specialized activity that\ninvolves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security\ntransactions. The use of a swap requires an understanding not only of the referenced asset, reference rate,\nor index, but also of the swap itself, without the benefit of observing the performance of the swap under\nall possible market conditions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or\nother underlying assets or principal. The absence of a regulated execution facility or contract market and\nlack of liquidity for swap transactions has led, in some instances, to difficulties in trading and\nvaluation, especially in the event of market disruptions. Under recently adopted rules and regulations,\ntransactions in some types of swaps are required to be centrally cleared. In a cleared derivatives\ntransaction, the Fund's counterparty to the transaction is a central derivatives clearing organization, or\nclearing house, rather than a bank or broker. Because the Fund is not a member of a clearing house, and only\nmembers of a clearing house can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund holds cleared\nderivatives through accounts at clearing members. In cleared derivatives transactions, the Fund will make\npayments (including margin payments) to and receive payments from a clearing house through its accounts at\nclearing members. Clearing members guarantee performance of their clients' obligations to the clearing\nhouse. Centrally cleared derivative arrangements may be less\n\n20\n\nfavorable to the Fund than bilateral (non-cleared) arrangements. For example, the Fund may be required to\nprovide greater amounts of margin for cleared derivatives transactions than for bilateral derivatives\ntransactions. Also, in contrast to bilateral derivatives transactions, in some cases following a period of\nnotice to the Fund, a clearing member generally can require termination of existing cleared derivatives\ntransactions at any time or an increase in margin requirements above the margin that the clearing member\nrequired at the beginning of a transaction. Clearing houses also have broad rights to increase margin\nrequirements for existing transactions or to terminate transactions at any time in accordance with their\nrules. The Fund is subject to risk if it enters into a derivatives transaction that is required to be\ncleared (or which SSGA FM expects to be cleared), and no clearing member is willing or able to clear the\ntransaction on the Fund's behalf. In that case, the transaction might have to be terminated, and the Fund\ncould lose some or all of the benefit of the transaction, including loss of an increase in the value of the\ntransaction and loss of hedging protection. In addition, the documentation governing the relationship\nbetween the Fund and clearing members is drafted by the clearing members and generally is less favorable to\nthe Fund than typical bilateral derivatives documentation. These clearing rules and other new rules and\nregulations could, among other things, restrict the Fund's ability to engage in, or increase the cost to the\nFund of, derivatives transactions, for example, by making some types of derivatives no longer available to\nthe Fund, increasing margin or capital requirements, or otherwise limiting liquidity or increasing\ntransaction costs. These regulations, as applicable to swaps, are relatively new and evolving, so their\npotential impact on the Fund and the financial system are not yet known. Because they are two party\ncontracts that may be subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and termination and because\nthey may have terms of greater than seven days, swap agreements may be considered to be illiquid and subject\nto the Fund's limitation on investments in illiquid investments. To the extent that a swap is not liquid, it\nmay not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an advantageous time or price,\nwhich may result in significant losses. Like most other investments, swap agreements are subject to the risk\nthat the market value of the instrument will change in a way detrimental to the Fund's interest. If the Fund\nuses a swap as a hedge against, or as a substitute for, a portfolio investment, the Fund will be exposed to\nthe risk that the swap will have or will develop imperfect or no correlation with the portfolio investment.\nThis could cause substantial losses for the Fund. While hedging strategies involving swap instruments can\nreduce the risk of loss, they can also reduce the opportunity for gain or even result in losses by\noffsetting favorable price movements in other Fund investments. Many swaps are complex and often valued\nsubjectively. EUROPE \u2013 RECENT EVENTS A number of countries in Europe, including Greece, Spain, Ireland,\nItaly, and Portugal, have substantial government debt levels. The concern over these debt levels has led to\nvolatility in the European financial markets, which has adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and\nmay continue to significantly affect every country in Europe. For some countries, the ability to repay\nsovereign debt is in question, and default is possible, which could affect their ability to borrow in the\nfuture. Several countries have agreed to multi-year bailout loans from the European Central Bank, the IMF,\nand other institutions. A default or debt restructuring by any European country can adversely impact holders\nof that country's debt and can affect exposures to other European Union ( \u201c EU \u201d ) countries and their\nfinancial companies as well. These financial difficulties may continue, worsen or spread within or outside\nEurope. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including\nausterity measures and reforms, may not work, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and\neconomic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Uncertainties regarding the viability of the EU\nhave impacted and may continue to impact markets in the United States and around the world. On January 31,\n2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201c Brexit \u201d ) and entered an\n11-month transition period. The transition period concluded on December 31, 2020, and the United Kingdom\nleft the EU single market and customs union under the terms of a new trade agreement. The agreement governs\nthe new relationship between the United Kingdom and EU with respect to trading goods and services, but\ncritical aspects of the relationship remain unresolved and subject to further negotiation and agreement.\nCertain aspects of Brexit have had an adverse impact on the region, leading to increased inflation, labor\nshortages and business closures, among others. The full scope and nature of the consequences of the exit are\nnot at this time known and are unlikely to be known for a significant period of time. It is also unknown\nwhether the United Kingdom's exit will increase the likelihood of other countries also departing the EU. Any\nadditional exits from the EU, or the possibility of such exits, may have a significant impact on the United\nKingdom, Europe, and global economies, which may result in increased volatility and illiquidity, new legal\nand regulatory uncertainties and potentially lower economic growth for such economies that could potentially\nhave an adverse effect on the value of the Fund's investments.\n\n21\n\nLIBOR RISK The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was a leading benchmark or reference rate for various\ncommercial and financial contracts, including corporate and municipal bonds, bank loans, asset-backed and\nmortgage-related securities, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. On July 27, 2017, the United\nKingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced the gradual phase out of the\nLIBOR rate, with nearly all LIBOR rate publications having ceased as of June 30, 2023 (some LIBOR rates\ncontinue to be published, but only on a temporary and synthetic basis). Alternatives to LIBOR have been\nestablished and others may be developed. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has\nidentified the Secured Overnight Financial Rate (SOFR) as the preferred alternative rate to LIBOR. SOFR is a\nrelatively new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. There\nremains uncertainty surrounding the nature of any replacement rates. The transition to a new reference rate\nmay result in (i) increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments or contracts that\npreviously relied on or still rely on LIBOR, (ii) a reduction in the value of certain instruments or\ncontracts held by the Fund, (iii) reduced effectiveness of related Fund transactions, such as hedging, (iv)\nadditional tax, accounting and regulatory risks, or (v) costs incurred in connection with closing out\npositions and entering into new trades. Any pricing adjustments to the Fund's investments resulting from a\nsubstitute reference rate may also adversely affect the Fund's performance and/or NAV. There is no assurance\nthat the composition or characteristics of any such alternative reference rate will be similar to or produce\nthe same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR or that instruments or contracts using an alternative rate\nwill have the same volume or liquidity. MARKET TURBULENCE RESULTING FROM INFECTIOUS ILLNESS A widespread\noutbreak of an infectious illness, such as COVID-19, may lead to governments and businesses world-wide\ntaking aggressive measures, including closing borders, restricting international and domestic travel, and\nthe imposition of prolonged quarantines of large populations. As occurred in the wake of COVID-19, the\nspread of such an illness may result in the disruption of and delays in the delivery of healthcare services\nand processes, the cancellation of organized events and educational institutions, the disruption of\nproduction and supply chains, a decline in consumer demand for certain goods and services, and general\nconcern and uncertainty, all of which may contribute to increased volatility in global markets. COVID-19,\nand other epidemics and pandemics that may arise in the future, could adversely affect the economies of many\nnations, the global economy, individual companies, sectors and industries, and capital markets in ways that\ncannot be foreseen at the present time. In addition, the impact of infectious diseases in developing or\nemerging market countries may be greater due to limited health care resources. Political, economic and\nsocial stresses caused by infectious illness also may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and\neconomic risks in certain countries. The duration of such an illness and its effects cannot be determined at\nthis time, but the effects could be present for an extended period of time. RUSSIA SANCTIONS RISK Sanctions\nthreatened or imposed by a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union and the\nUnited Kingdom, and other intergovernmental actions that have been or may be undertaken in the future,\nagainst Russia, Russian entities or Russian individuals, may result in the devaluation of Russian currency,\na downgrade in the country's credit rating, an immediate freeze of Russian assets, a decline in the value\nand liquidity of Russian securities, property or interests, and/or other adverse consequences to the Russian\neconomy or the Fund. The scope and scale of sanctions in place at a particular time may be expanded or\notherwise modified in a way that have negative effects on the Fund. Sanctions, or the threat of new or\nmodified sanctions, could impair the ability of the Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive, deliver or otherwise\ntransact in certain affected securities or other investment instruments. Sanctions could also result in\nRussia taking counter measures or other actions in response, which may further impair the value and\nliquidity of Russian securities. These sanctions, and the resulting disruption of the Russian economy, may\ncause volatility in other regional and global markets and may negatively impact the performance of various\nsectors and industries, as well as companies in other countries, which could have a negative effect on the\nperformance of the Fund, even if the Fund does not have direct exposure to securities of Russian issuers. As\na collective result of the imposition of sanctions, Russian government countermeasures and the impact that\nthey have had on the trading markets for Russian securities, the Fund may use fair valuation procedures\napproved by the Fund's Board to value certain Russian securities, which could result in such securities\nbeing deemed to have a zero value.\n\n22\n\nA reduction in liquidity of certain Fund holdings as a result of sanctions and related actions may cause the\nFund to experience increased premiums or discounts to its NAV and/or wider bid-ask spreads. Additionally, if\nit becomes impracticable or unlawful for the Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by,\nsanctions, or if deemed appropriate by the Fund's investment adviser, the Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits\nof the affected securities in connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit,\nwhich may also increase the Fund's transaction costs. TAX RISKS As with any investment, you should consider\nhow your investment in Shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in the Prospectus and this SAI\nis provided as general information. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences\nof an investment in Shares of the Fund. Unless your investment in Shares is made through a tax-exempt entity\nor tax-advantaged retirement account, such as an individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the\npossible tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Shares. Investment Restrictions The\nTrust has adopted the following investment restrictions as fundamental policies with respect to the Fund.\nThese restrictions cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of the Fund's\noutstanding voting securities. For purposes of the 1940 Act, a majority of the outstanding voting securities\nof the Fund means the vote, at an annual or a special meeting of the security holders of the Trust, of the\nlesser of (1) 67% or more of the voting securities of the Fund present at such meeting, if the holders of\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (2)\nmore than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Except with the approval of a majority of\nthe outstanding voting securities, the Fund may not: 1. Concentrate its investments in securities of issuers\nin the same industry, except as may be necessary to approximate the composition of the Fund's underlying\nIndex; (1) 2. Make loans to another person except as permitted by the 1940 Act or other governing statute,\nby the Rules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund; 3. Issue\nsenior securities or borrow money except as permitted by the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by the\nRules thereunder, or by the SEC or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund; 4. Invest directly\nin real estate unless the real estate is acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other\ninstruments. This restriction shall not preclude the Fund from investing in companies that deal in real\nestate or in instruments that are backed or secured by real estate; 5. Act as an underwriter of another\nissuer's securities, except to the extent the Fund may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of\nthe Securities Act in connection with the Fund's purchase and sale of portfolio securities; or 6. Invest in\ncommodities except as permitted by the 1940 Act or other governing statute, by the Rules thereunder, or by\nthe SEC or other regulatory agency with authority over the Fund. In addition to the investment restrictions\nadopted as fundamental policies as set forth above, the Fund observes the following restrictions, which may\nbe changed by the Board without a shareholder vote. The Fund will not: 1. Invest in the securities of a\ncompany for the purpose of exercising management or control, provided that the Trust may vote the investment\nsecurities owned by the Fund in accordance with its views; or 2. Under normal circumstances, invest less\nthan 80% of its total assets in securities that comprise the benchmark Index. Securities that have economic\ncharacteristics substantially identical to the economic characteristics of the securities that comprise the\nIndex are included within this 80% investment policy for the Fund.\n\n(1) The SEC Staff considers concentration to involve more than 25% of a fund's assets to be invested in an\nindustry or group of industries.\n\n23\n\n3. Under normal circumstances, invest less than 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of borrowings for\ninvestment purposes, in U.S. Treasury securities. Prior to any change in this 80% investment policy, the\nFund will provide shareholders with 60 days' written notice. The Fund defines the foregoing terms in\naccordance with the definition of such terms per the applicable Index. If a percentage limitation is adhered\nto at the time of investment or contract, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from any\nchange in value or total or net assets will not result in a violation of such restriction, except that the\npercentage limitations with respect to the borrowing of money will be observed continuously. With respect to\nthe limitation on borrowing, in the event that a subsequent change in net assets or other circumstances\ncause the Fund to exceed its limitation, the Fund will take steps to bring the aggregate amount of borrowing\nback within the limitations within three days thereafter (not including Sundays and holidays). The 1940 Act\ncurrently permits the Fund to loan up to 33 1/3% of its total assets. With respect to borrowing, the 1940\nAct presently allows the Fund to: (1) borrow from any bank (including pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating\nassets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets, (2) borrow money for temporary purposes in an amount\nnot exceeding 5% of the value of the Fund's total assets at the time of the loan, and (3) enter into reverse\nrepurchase agreements. However, under normal circumstances any borrowings by the Fund will not exceed 10% of\nthe Fund's total assets. The 1940 Act generally prohibits funds from issuing senior securities, although it\ndoes not treat certain transactions as senior securities, such as certain borrowings, with appropriate asset\ncoverage. With respect to investments in commodities, the 1940 Act presently permits the Fund to invest in\ncommodities in accordance with investment policies contained in its prospectus and SAI. Any such investment\nshall also comply with the CEA and the rules and regulations thereunder. The 1940 Act does not directly\nrestrict an investment company's ability to invest in real estate, but does require that every investment\ncompany have the fundamental investment policy governing such investments. The Fund will not purchase or\nsell real estate, except that the Fund may invest in companies that deal in real estate (including REITs) or\nin instruments that are backed or secured by real estate. Exchange Listing and Trading A discussion of\nexchange listing and trading matters associated with an investment in the Fund is contained in the\nProspectus under \u201c PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION \u201d and \u201c ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d The\ndiscussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, such sections of the Prospectus. The\nShares of the Fund are approved for listing and trading on the Exchange, subject to notice of issuance.\nShares trade on the Exchange at prices that may differ to some degree from their net asset value. There can\nbe no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of Shares of the\nFund will continue to be met. The Exchange may consider the suspension of trading in, and may initiate\ndelisting proceedings of, the Shares of the Fund under any of the following circumstances: (i) if the\nExchange becomes aware that the Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the\n1940 Act; (ii) if the Fund no longer complies with the applicable listing requirements set forth in the\nExchange's rules; (iii) if, following the initial twelve-month period after commencement of trading on the\nExchange of the Fund, there are fewer than 50 beneficial holders of the Fund; or (iv) if such other event\nshall occur or condition exists which, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes further dealings on the\nExchange inadvisable. The Exchange will remove the Shares from listing and trading upon termination of the\nFund. The Trust reserves the right to adjust the Share price of the Fund in the future to maintain\nconvenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or\nreverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Fund or an investor's equity\ninterest in the Fund. As in the case of other publicly traded securities, brokers' commissions on\ntransactions will be based on negotiated commission rates at customary levels. The base and trading\ncurrencies of the Fund is the U.S. dollar. The base currency is the currency in which the Fund's net asset\nvalue per Share is calculated and the trading currency is the currency in which Shares of the Fund are\nlisted and traded on the Exchange. Management of the Trust The following information supplements and should\nbe read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c MANAGEMENT. \u201d\n\n24\n\nBOARD RESPONSIBILITIES The management and affairs of the Trust and its series, including the Fund described\nin this SAI, are overseen by the Trustees. The Board has approved contracts, as described in this SAI, under\nwhich certain companies provide essential management services to the Trust. Like most mutual funds, the day-\nto-day business of the Trust, including the management of risk, is performed by third party service\nproviders, such as the Adviser, Distributor, Administrator, and Sub-Administrator. The Trustees are\nresponsible for overseeing the Trust's service providers and, thus, have oversight responsibility with\nrespect to risk management performed by those service providers. Risk management seeks to identify and\naddress risks, i.e ., events or circumstances that could have material adverse effects on the business,\noperations, shareholder services, investment performance or reputation of the Fund. The Fund and their\nservice providers employ a variety of processes, procedures and controls to identify various of those\npossible events or circumstances, to lessen the probability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the\neffects of such events or circumstances if they do occur. Each service provider is responsible for one or\nmore discrete aspects of the Trust's business and, consequently, for managing the risks associated with that\nbusiness. The Board has emphasized to the Fund's service providers the importance of maintaining vigorous\nrisk management. The Trustees' role in risk oversight begins before the inception of the Fund, at which time\nthe Fund's Adviser presents the Board with information concerning the investment objectives, strategies and\nrisks of the Fund, as well as proposed investment limitations for the Fund. Additionally, the Fund's Adviser\nprovides the Board with an overview of, among other things, their investment philosophies, brokerage\npractices and compliance infrastructures. Thereafter, the Board continues its oversight function as various\npersonnel, including the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer, as well as personnel of the Adviser and other\nservice providers, such as the Fund's independent accountants, make periodic reports to the Audit Committee\nor to the Board with respect to various aspects of risk management. The Board and the Audit Committee\noversee efforts by management and service providers to manage risks to which the Fund may be exposed. The\nBoard is responsible for overseeing the nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Fund by\nthe Adviser and receives information about those services at its regular meetings. In addition, on an annual\nbasis, in connection with its consideration of whether to renew the Investment Advisory Agreement with the\nAdviser, the Board meets with the Adviser to review such services. Among other things, the Board regularly\nconsiders the Adviser's adherence to the Fund's investment restrictions and compliance with various Fund\npolicies and procedures and with applicable securities regulations. The Board also reviews information about\nthe Fund's investments. The Trust's Chief Compliance Officer reports regularly to the Board to review and\ndiscuss compliance issues. At least annually, the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer provides the Board with a\nreport reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Trust's policies and procedures and those of its\nservice providers, including the Adviser. The report addresses the operation of the policies and procedures\nof the Trust and each service provider since the date of the last report; any material changes to the\npolicies and procedures since the date of the last report; any recommendations for material changes to the\npolicies and procedures; and any material compliance matters since the date of the last report. The Board\nreceives reports from the Fund's service providers regarding operational risks and risks related to the\nvaluation and liquidity of portfolio securities. Regular reports are made to the Board concerning\ninvestments for which market quotations are not readily available. Annually, the independent registered\npublic accounting firm reviews with the Audit Committee its audit of the Fund's financial statements,\nfocusing on major areas of risk encountered by the Fund and noting any significant deficiencies or material\nweaknesses in the Fund's internal controls. Additionally, in connection with its oversight function, the\nBoard oversees Fund management's implementation of disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports with the SEC are\nrecorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods. The Board also oversees the\nTrust's internal controls over financial reporting, which comprise policies and procedures designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Trust's financial reporting and the\npreparation of the Trust's financial statements. From their review of these reports and discussions with the\nAdviser, the Chief Compliance Officer, the independent registered public accounting firm and other service\nproviders, the Board and the Audit Committee learn in detail about the material risks of the Fund, thereby\nfacilitating a dialogue about how management and service providers identify and mitigate those risks. The\nBoard recognizes that not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified and/or quantified, that it\nmay not be practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to\nbear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Fund's goals, and that the processes,\nprocedures and controls employed to\n\n25\n\naddress certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, reports received by the Trustees as\nto risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant information. Most of the Fund's\ninvestment management and business affairs are carried out by or through the Fund's Adviser and other\nservice providers, each of which has an independent interest in risk management but whose policies and the\nmethods by which one or more risk management functions are carried out may differ from the Fund's and each\nother's in the setting of priorities, the resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. As\na result of the foregoing and other factors, the Board's ability to monitor and manage risk, as a practical\nmatter, is subject to limitations. TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS There are eight members of the Board of Trustees,\nsix of whom are not interested persons of the Trust, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act ( \u201c Independent\nTrustees \u201d ). Carl Verboncoeur, an Independent Trustee, serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board has\ndetermined its leadership structure is appropriate given the specific characteristics and circumstances of\nthe Trust. The Board made this determination in consideration of, among other things, the fact that the\nIndependent Trustees constitute a super-majority (75%) of the Board, the fact that the chairperson of each\nCommittee of the Board is an Independent Trustee, the amount of assets under management in the Trust, and\nthe number of funds overseen by the Board. The Board also believes that its leadership structure facilitates\nthe orderly and efficient flow of information to the Independent Trustees from fund management. The Board of\nTrustees has two standing committees: the Audit Committee and Trustee Committee.

Each Code of Ethics permits personnel, subject to that Code\nof Ethics, to invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, subject to certain limitations,\nincluding securities that may be purchased or held by the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Codes of\nEthics will be effective in preventing such activities. Each Code of Ethics, filed as exhibits to this\nregistration statement, may be examined at the office of the SEC in Washington, D.C. or on the Internet at\nthe SEC's website at https://www.sec.gov . PROXY VOTING POLICIES The Board has delegated the responsibility\nto vote proxies on securities held by the Fund to the Adviser, subject to certain exceptions. The Board has\nretained authority to vote proxies for certain bank and bank holding company securities ( \u201c Bank Securities\n\u201d ) that may be held by the Fund from time to time. The Board has adopted the Institutional Shareholder\nServices, Inc.'s ( \u201c ISS \u201d ) benchmark proxy voting policy with respect to voting such Bank Securities'\nproxies. The Board has retained this authority in order to permit the Adviser to utilize exemptions from\nlimitations arising under the Bank Holding Company\n\n32\n\nAct of 1956, as amended, that might otherwise prevent the Adviser from acquiring Bank Securities on behalf\nof the Fund. Each of the Trust's and the Adviser's proxy voting policies, as well as ISS' benchmark proxy\nvoting policy, are attached as an appendix to this SAI. Information regarding how the Fund voted proxies\nrelating to its portfolio securities during the most recent twelve-month period ended June 30 is available:\n(1) without charge by calling 1-866-787-2257; (2) on the Fund's website at https://www.ssga.com/spdrs; and\n(3) on the SEC's website at https://www.sec.gov. DISCLOSURE OF PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS POLICY The Trust has\nadopted a policy regarding the disclosure of information about the Trust's portfolio holdings. The Board\nmust approve all material amendments to this policy. The Fund's portfolio holdings are publicly disseminated\neach day the Fund is open for business through financial reporting and news services including publicly\naccessible Internet web sites. In addition, a basket composition file, which includes the security names and\nshare quantities to deliver in exchange for Shares, together with estimates and actual cash components, is\npublicly disseminated daily prior to the opening of the Exchange via the National Securities Clearing\nCorporation ( \u201c NSCC \u201d ). The basket represents one Creation Unit of the Fund. The Trust, the Adviser or\nState Street will not disseminate non-public information concerning the Trust, except information may be\nmade available prior to its public availability: (i) to a party for a legitimate business purpose related to\nthe day-to-day operations of the Fund, including (a) a service provider, (b) the stock exchanges upon which\nan ETF is listed, (c) the NSCC, (d) the Depository Trust Company, and (e) financial data/research companies\nsuch as Morningstar, Bloomberg L.P., and Reuters, or (ii) to any other party for a legitimate business or\nregulatory purpose, upon waiver or exception, with the consent of an applicable Trust officer. Investment\nAdvisory and Other Services THE INVESTMENT ADVISER SSGA FM acts as investment adviser to the Trust and,\nsubject to the oversight of the Board, is responsible for the investment management of the Fund. As of March\n31, 2024, the Adviser managed approximately $1.00 trillion in assets. The Adviser's principal address is One\nIron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. The Adviser, a Massachusetts corporation, is a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of State Street Global Advisors, Inc., which itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street\nCorporation, a publicly held financial holding company. State Street Global Advisors ( \u201c SSGA \u201d ),\nconsisting of the Adviser and other investment advisory affiliates of State Street Corporation, is the\ninvestment management arm of State Street Corporation. The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund\npursuant to an investment advisory agreement ( \u201c Investment Advisory Agreement \u201d ) between the Trust and the\nAdviser. The Investment Advisory Agreement, with respect to the Fund, continues in effect for two years from\nits effective date, and thereafter is subject to annual approval by (1) the Board or (2) vote of a majority\nof the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, provided that in either event\nsuch continuance also is approved by a majority of the Board who are not interested persons (as defined in\nthe 1940 Act) of the Trust by a vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such\napproval. The Investment Advisory Agreement with respect to the Fund is terminable without penalty, on 60\ndays' notice, by the Board or by a vote of the holders of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the\nFund's outstanding voting securities. The Investment Advisory Agreement is also terminable upon 60 days'\nnotice by the Adviser and will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the\n1940 Act). Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser, subject to the oversight of the Board and\nin conformity with the stated investment policies of the Fund, manages the investment of the Fund's assets.\nThe Adviser is responsible for placing purchase and sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the\ninvestment portfolio of the Fund. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is not liable\nfor certain liabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the federal securities laws, unless\nsuch loss or liability results from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of\nits duties or the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties. For the services provided to the Fund\nunder the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser monthly fees based on a percentage of the\nFund's average daily net assets as set forth in the Fund's Prospectus. The Adviser pays all expenses of the\nFund other than the management fee, brokerage expenses, taxes, interest, fees and expenses of the\nIndependent Trustees (including any Trustee's counsel fees), acquired fund fees and expenses, litigation\nexpenses and other extraordinary expenses.\n\n33\n\nFrom time to time, the Adviser may waive all or a portion of its fee. The Adviser has contractually agreed\nto waive a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse expenses in an amount equal to any acquired fund\nfees and expenses (excluding holdings in acquired funds for cash management purposes, if any) for the Fund\nuntil October 31, 2025. This waiver and/or reimbursement does not provide for the recoupment by the Adviser\nof any fees the Adviser previously waived. The Adviser may continue the waiver and/or reimbursement from\nyear to year, but there is no guarantee that the Adviser will do so and the waiver and/or reimbursement may\nbe cancelled or modified at any time after the end of its current term. The waiver and/or reimbursement may\nnot be terminated prior to the end of its current term except with the approval of the Board. The Fund had\nnot commenced operations as of the date of this SAI and therefore did not pay fees to the Adviser for the\npast three fiscal years. A summary of the factors considered by the Board of Trustees in connection with the\ninitial approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement for the Fund will be available in the Fund's Form\nN-CSR filing with the SEC after the Fund commences operations. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS The Adviser manages the\nFund using a team of investment professionals. The professionals primarily responsible for the day-to-day\nportfolio management of the Fund are Joanna Madden and Cynthia Moy. The following table lists the number and\ntypes of accounts managed by each of the key professionals involved in the day-to-day portfolio management\nfor the Fund and assets under management in those accounts. The total number of accounts and assets have\nbeen allocated to each respective manager. Therefore, some accounts and assets have been counted twice.\nOther Accounts Managed as of March 31, 2024\n                                                                                                            \n  Portfolio   Registered\u2026  AssetsMana\u2026         Other  AssetsMana\u2026  OtherAccoun\u2026  AssetsMana\u2026  TotalAssets\u2026  \n  Manager                               PooledInves\u2026                                                        \n  Joanna               40      $104.81           130      $193.09           164      $112.02       $409.92  \n  Madden                                                                                                    \n  Cynthia              40      $104.81           130      $193.09           164      $112.02       $409.92  \n  Moy                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n* There are no performance-based fees associated with these accounts. The Fund had not commenced operations\nprior to the date of this SAI and therefore the portfolio managers did not beneficially own any Shares.\nConflicts of Interest. A portfolio manager that has responsibility for managing more than one account may be\nsubject to potential conflicts of interest because he or she is responsible for other accounts in addition\nto the Fund. Those conflicts could include preferential treatment of one account over others in terms of:\n(a) the portfolio manager's execution of different investment strategies for various accounts; or (b) the\nallocation of resources or of investment opportunities. Portfolio managers may manage numerous accounts for\nmultiple clients. These accounts may include registered investment companies, other types of pooled accounts\n(e.g., collective investment funds), and separate accounts (i.e., accounts managed on behalf of individuals\nor public or private institutions). Portfolio managers make investment decisions for each account based on\nthe investment objectives and policies and other relevant investment considerations applicable to that\nportfolio. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of a portfolio manager's responsibility\nfor multiple accounts with similar investment guidelines. Under these circumstances, a potential investment\nmay be suitable for more than one of the portfolio manager's accounts, but the quantity of the investment\navailable for purchase is less than the aggregate amount the accounts would ideally allocate to the\nopportunity. Similar conflicts may arise when multiple accounts seek to dispose of the same investment. The\nportfolio managers may also manage accounts whose objectives and policies differ from that of the Fund.\nThese differences may be such that under certain circumstances, trading activity appropriate for one account\nmanaged by the portfolio manager may have adverse consequences for another account managed by the portfolio\nmanager. For example, an account may sell a significant position in a security, which could cause the market\nprice of that security to decrease, while the Fund maintained its position in that security. A potential\nconflict may arise when the portfolio managers are responsible for accounts that have different advisory\nfees\u2014 the difference in fees could create an incentive for the portfolio manager to favor one account over\nanother, for example, in terms of access to investment opportunities. This conflict may be heightened if an\naccount is subject to a performance-based fee, as applicable. Another potential conflict may arise when the\nportfolio manager has a personal investment in one or more accounts that participate in transactions with\nother accounts. His or her personal investment(s) may create an incentive for the portfolio manager to favor\none account over another. The Adviser has adopted policies and procedures\n\n34\n\nreasonably designed to address these potential material conflicts. For instance, portfolio managers are\nnormally responsible for all accounts within a certain investment discipline and do not, absent special\ncircumstances, differentiate among the various accounts when allocating resources. Additionally, the Adviser\nand its advisory affiliates have processes and procedures for allocating investment opportunities among\nportfolios that are designed to provide a fair and equitable allocation. With respect to conflicts arising\nfrom personal investments, all employees, including portfolio managers, must comply with personal trading\ncontrols established by each of the Adviser's and Trust's Code of Ethics. SSGA's culture is complemented and\nreinforced by a total rewards strategy that is based on a pay for performance philosophy which seeks to\noffer a competitive pay mix of base salary, benefits, cash incentives and deferred compensation. Salary is\nbased on a number of factors, including external benchmarking data and market trends, and performance both\nat the business and individual level. SSGA's Global Human Resources department regularly participates in\ncompensation surveys in order to provide SSGA with market-based compensation information that helps support\nindividual pay decisions. Additionally, subject to State Street and SSGA business results, an incentive pool\nis allocated to SSGA to reward its employees. The size of the incentive pool for most business units is\nbased on the firm's overall profitability and other factors, including performance against risk-related\ngoals. For most SSGA investment teams, SSGA recognizes and rewards performance by linking annual incentive\ndecisions for investment teams to the firm's or business unit's profitability and business unit investment\nperformance over a multi-year period. Incentive pool funding for most active investment teams is driven in\npart by the post-tax investment performance of fund(s) managed by the team versus the return levels of the\nbenchmark index(es) of the fund(s) on a one-, three- and, in some cases, five-year basis. For most active\ninvestment teams, a material portion of incentive compensation for senior staff is deferred over a four-year\nperiod into the SSGA Long-Term Incentive ( \u201c SSGA LTI \u201d ) program. For these teams, The SSGA LTI program\nindexes the performance of these deferred awards against the post-tax investment performance of fund(s)\nmanaged by the team. This is intended to align our investment team's compensation with client interests,\nboth through annual incentive compensation awards and through the long-term value of deferred awards in the\nSSGA LTI program. For the index equity investment team, incentive pool funding is driven in part by the\npost-tax 1 and 3-year tracking error of the funds managed by the team against the benchmark indexes of the\nfunds. The discretionary allocation of the incentive pool to the business units within SSGA is influenced by\nmarket-based compensation data, as well as the overall performance of each business unit. Individual\ncompensation decisions are made by the employee's manager, in conjunction with the senior management of the\nemployee's business unit. These decisions are based on the overall performance of the employee and, as\nmentioned above, on the performance of the firm and business unit. Depending on the job level, a portion of\nthe annual incentive may be awarded in deferred compensation, which may include cash and/or Deferred Stock\nAwards (State Street stock), which typically vest over a four-year period. This helps to retain staff and\nfurther aligns SSGA employees' interests with SSGA clients' and shareholders' long-term interests. SSGA\nrecognizes and rewards outstanding performance by: \u2022 Promoting employee ownership to connect employees\ndirectly to the company's success. \u2022 Using rewards to reinforce mission, vision, values and business\nstrategy. \u2022 Seeking to recognize and preserve the firm's unique culture and team orientation. \u2022 Providing\nall employees the opportunity to share in the success of SSGA.

An affiliate of the Distributor also receives compensation from State Street for providing on-\nline creation and redemption functionality to Authorized Participants through its Fund Connect application.\nThe Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or Distributor, may directly or indirectly make\ncash payments to certain broker-dealers for participating in activities that are designed to make registered\nrepresentatives and other professionals more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the\nSPDR funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations,\neducational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems.\n\n36\n\nIn addition, as of the date of this SAI, the Adviser and/or Distributor had arrangements whereby they may\nmake payments, other than for the educational programs and marketing activities described above, to Pershing\nLLC ( \u201c Pershing \u201d ), RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( \u201c RBC \u201d ), LPL Financial, LLC ( \u201c LPL \u201d ), and Morgan\nStanley Wealth Management, LLC. These amounts, which may be significant, are paid by the Adviser and/or\nDistributor from their own resources and not from Fund assets. Pursuant to these arrangements, Pershing, RBC\nand LPL have agreed to offer certain SPDR funds to their customers and not to charge certain of their\ncustomers any commissions when those customers purchase or sell shares of certain SPDR funds. Payments to a\nbroker-dealer or intermediary may create potential conflicts of interest between the broker dealer or\nintermediary and its clients. In addition, the Adviser or Distributor, or an affiliate of the Adviser or\nDistributor, as well as an index provider that is not affiliated with the Adviser or Distributor, may\nreimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to other persons in consideration of services,\nprovision of data, or other activities that they believe may benefit the SPDR business or facilitate\ninvestment in SPDR funds. The Distribution Agreement provides that it may be terminated at any time, without\nthe payment of any penalty, as to the Fund: (i) by vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees or (ii) by\nvote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, on at\nleast 60 days' written notice to the Distributor. The Distribution Agreement is also terminable upon 60\ndays' notice by the Distributor and will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined\nin the 1940 Act). The continuation of the Distribution Agreement and any other related agreements is subject\nto annual approval of the Board, including by a majority of the Independent Trustees, as described above.\nThe allocation among the Trust's series of fees and expenses payable under the Distribution Agreement will\nbe made pro rata in accordance with the daily net assets of the respective series. The Distributor may also\nenter into agreements with securities dealers ( \u201c Soliciting Dealers \u201d ) who will solicit purchases of\nCreation Unit aggregations of Shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Participating Parties (as defined\nin the \u201c Book Entry Only System \u201d section below) and/or DTC Participants (as defined below). Pursuant to the\nDistribution Agreement, the Trust has agreed to indemnify the Distributor, and may indemnify Soliciting\nDealers and Authorized Participants (as described below) entering into agreements with the Distributor, for\ncertain liabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the federal securities laws, unless such\nloss or liability results from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its\nduties or the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Distribution Agreement or other\nagreement, as applicable. Brokerage Transactions All portfolio transactions are placed on behalf of the Fund\nby the Adviser. Purchases and sales of securities on a securities exchange are affected through brokers who\ncharge a commission for their services. Ordinarily commissions are not charged on over-the-counter orders\n(e.g., fixed income securities) because the Fund pays a spread which is included in the cost of the security\nand represents the difference between the dealer's quoted price at which it is willing to sell the security\nand the dealer's quoted price at which it is willing to buy the security. When the Fund executes an over-\nthe-counter order with an electronic communications network or an alternative trading system, a commission\nis charged by such electronic communications networks and alternative trading systems as they execute such\norders on an agency basis. Securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting\nfees. In placing a portfolio transaction, the Adviser seeks to achieve best execution. The Adviser's duty to\nseek best execution requires the Adviser to take reasonable steps to obtain for the client as favorable an\noverall result as possible for Fund portfolio transactions under the circumstances, taking into account\nvarious factors that are relevant to the particular transaction. The Adviser refers to and selects from the\nlist of approved trading counterparties maintained by the Adviser's Credit Risk Management team. In\nselecting a trading counterparty for a particular trade, the Adviser seeks to weigh relevant factors\nincluding, but not limited to the following: \u2022 Prompt and reliable execution; \u2022 The competitiveness of\ncommission rates and spreads, if applicable; \u2022 The financial strength, stability and/or reputation of the\ntrading counterparty;\n\n37\n\n\u2022 The willingness and ability of the executing trading counterparty to execute transactions (and commit\ncapital) of size in liquid and illiquid markets without disrupting the market for the security; \u2022 Local\nlaws, regulations or restrictions; \u2022 The ability of the trading counterparty to maintain confidentiality; \u2022\nThe availability and capability of execution venues, including electronic communications networks for\ntrading and execution management systems made available to Adviser; \u2022 Market share; \u2022 Liquidity; \u2022 Price; \u2022\nExecution related costs; \u2022 History of execution of orders; \u2022 Likelihood of execution and settlement; \u2022 Order\nsize and nature; \u2022 Clearance and settlement capabilities, especially in high volatility market environments;\n\u2022 Availability of lendable securities; \u2022 Sophistication of the trading counterparty's trading capabilities\nand infrastructure/facilities; \u2022 The operational efficiency with which transactions are processed and\ncleared, taking into account the order size and complexity; \u2022 Speed and responsiveness to the Adviser; \u2022\nAccess to secondary markets; \u2022 Counterparty exposure; and \u2022 Depending upon the circumstances, the Adviser\nmay take other relevant factors into account if the Adviser believes that these are important in taking all\nsufficient steps to obtain the best possible result for execution of the order. In selecting a trading\ncounterparty, the price of the transaction and costs related to the execution of the transaction typically\nmerit a high relative importance, depending on the circumstances. The Adviser does not necessarily select a\ntrading counterparty based upon price and costs but may take other relevant factors into account if it\nbelieves that these are important in taking reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for the Fund\nunder the circumstances. Consequently, the Adviser may cause a client to pay a trading counterparty more\nthan another trading counterparty might have charged for the same transaction in recognition of the value\nand quality of the brokerage services provided. The following matters may influence the relative importance\nthat the Adviser places upon the relevant factors: (i) The nature and characteristics of the order or\ntransaction. For example, size of order, market impact of order, limits, or other instructions relating to\nthe order; (ii) The characteristics of the financial instrument(s) or other assets which are the subject of\nthat order. For example, whether the order pertains to an equity, fixed income, derivative or convertible\ninstrument; (iii) The characteristics of the execution venues to which that order can be directed, if\nrelevant. For example, availability and capabilities of electronic trading systems; (iv) Whether the\ntransaction is a \u2018delivery versus payment' or \u2018over-the-counter' transaction. The creditworthiness of the\ntrading counterparty, the amount of existing exposure to a trading counterparty and trading counterparty\nsettlement capabilities may be given a higher relative importance in the case of \u2018over-the-counter'\ntransactions; and/or (v) Any other circumstances that the Adviser believes are relevant at the time. The\nprocess by which trading counterparties are selected to effect transactions is designed to exclude\nconsideration of the sales efforts conducted by broker-dealers in relation to the Fund. The Adviser does not\ncurrently use the Fund's assets in connection with third-party soft dollar arrangements. While the Adviser\ndoes not currently use \u201c soft \u201d or commission dollars paid by the Fund for the purchase of third-party\nresearch, the Adviser reserves the right to do so in the future.\n\n38\n\nThe Fund had not commenced operations as of the date of this SAI and therefore did not pay brokerage\ncommissions during the past three fiscal years. Securities of \u201c Regular Broker-Dealers \u201d : The Trust is\nrequired to identify any securities of its \u201c regular brokers and dealers \u201d (as such term is defined in the\n1940 Act) which it may hold at the close of its most recent fiscal year. \u201c Regular brokers or dealers \u201d of\nthe Trust are the ten brokers or dealers that, during the most recent fiscal year: (i) received the greatest\ndollar amounts of brokerage commissions from the Trust's portfolio transactions; (ii) engaged as principal\nin the largest dollar amounts of portfolio transactions of the Trust; or (iii) sold the largest dollar\namounts of the Trust's shares. The Fund had not commenced operations as of the date of this SAI and\ntherefore did not have any holdings in Securities of Regular Broker-Dealers as of June 30, 2023. Portfolio\nTurnover: Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as within a year. The Fund may experience\nhigher portfolio turnover when migrating to a different benchmark index. High turnover rates are likely to\nresult in comparatively greater brokerage expenses or transaction costs. The overall reasonableness of\nbrokerage commissions and transaction costs is evaluated by the Adviser based upon its knowledge of\navailable information as to the general level of commissions and transaction costs paid by other\ninstitutional investors for comparable services. Book Entry Only System The following information\nsupplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c ADDITIONAL\nPURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d The Depository Trust Company ( \u201c DTC \u201d ) acts as securities depositary for\nthe Shares. Shares of the Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee,\nCede & Co., and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. Except in the limited circumstance provided below,\ncertificates will not be issued for Shares. DTC, a limited-purpose trust company, was created to hold\nsecurities of its participants (the \u201c DTC Participants \u201d ) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of\nsecurities transactions among the DTC Participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes\nin accounts of the DTC Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities\ncertificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\ncorporations and certain other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC. More\nspecifically, DTC is owned by a number of its DTC Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d\n) and FINRA. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust\ncompanies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or\nindirectly (the \u201c Indirect Participants \u201d ). Beneficial ownership of Shares is limited to DTC Participants,\nIndirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in Shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as \u201c\nBeneficial Owners \u201d ) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records\nmaintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to\nIndirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive\nfrom or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of Shares. Conveyance\nof all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to\nthe Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon\nrequest and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the Shares of the Fund held by each DTC\nParticipant. The Trust, either directly or through a third party service, shall inquire of each such DTC\nParticipant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding Shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC\nParticipant. The Trust, either directly or through a third party service, shall provide each such DTC\nParticipant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such\nplace as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication\nmay be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition,\nthe Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant and/or third party service a fair and reasonable amount as\nreimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and\nregulatory requirements. Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the\nregistered holder of all Shares. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit\nimmediately DTC Participants' accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial\ninterests in Shares of the Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its\n\n39\n\nnominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of Shares held through\nsuch DTC Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case\nwith securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a \u201c street name, \u201d and\nwill be the responsibility of such DTC Participants. The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any\naspects of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of\nbeneficial ownership interests in such Shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records\nrelating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and\nthe DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and\nBeneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may determine to discontinue providing its\nservice with respect to Shares at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its\nresponsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take\naction either to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost or, if such a\nreplacement is unavailable, to issue and deliver printed certificates representing ownership of Shares,\nunless the Trust makes other arrangements with respect thereto satisfactory to the Exchange. Control Persons\nand Principal Holders of Securities The Fund had not commenced operations prior to the date of this SAI and\ntherefore did not have any beneficial owners that owned greater than 5% of the outstanding voting securities\nas of the date of this SAI. An Authorized Participant (as defined below) may hold of record more than 25% of\nthe outstanding Shares. From time to time, Authorized Participants may be a beneficial and/or legal owner of\nthe Fund, may be affiliated with an index provider, may be deemed to have control of the Fund and/or may be\nable to affect the outcome of matters presented for a vote of the shareholders of the Fund. Authorized\nParticipants may execute an irrevocable proxy granting the Distributor or another affiliate of State Street\n(the \u201c Agent \u201d ) power to vote or abstain from voting such Authorized Participant's beneficially or legally\nowned Shares. In such cases, the Agent shall mirror vote (or abstain from voting) such Shares in the same\nproportion as all other beneficial owners of the Fund. The Trustees and Officers of the Trust, as a group,\nown less than 1% of the Trust's voting securities as of the date of this SAI. Purchase and Redemption of\nCreation Units The Fund issues and redeems its Shares on a continuous basis, at net asset value, only in a\nlarge specified number of Shares called a \u201c Creation Unit. \u201d The value of the Fund is determined once each\nbusiness day as described under \u201c Determination of Net Asset Value. \u201d The Creation Unit size for the Fund\nmay change. Authorized Participants (as defined below) will be notified of such change. The principal\nconsideration for creations and redemptions for the Fund is in-kind, although this may be revised at any\ntime without notice. PURCHASE (CREATION) The Trust issues and sells Shares of the Fund only: in Creation\nUnits on a continuous basis through the Principal Underwriter, without a sales load (but subject to\ntransaction fees), at their NAV per share next determined after receipt of an order, on any Business Day (as\ndefined below), in proper form pursuant to the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement ( \u201c Participant\nAgreement \u201d ). A \u201c Business Day \u201d with respect to the Fund is, generally, any day on which the NYSE is open\nfor business, with the exception of Veterans Day and Columbus Day. FUND DEPOSIT The consideration for\npurchase of a Creation Unit of the Fund generally consists of either (i) the Deposit Securities and the Cash\nComponent (defined below), computed as described below or (ii) the cash value of the Deposit Securities and\nthe \u201c Cash Component, \u201d computed as described below. When accepting purchases of Creation Units for cash,\nthe Fund may incur additional costs associated with the acquisition of Deposit Securities that would\notherwise be provided by an in-kind purchaser.\n\n40\n\nTogether, the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the Cash Component constitute the \u201c\nFund Deposit, \u201d which represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of\nthe Fund. The \u201c Cash Component, \u201d which may include a Dividend Equivalent Payment, is an amount equal to the\ndifference between the net asset value of the Shares (per Creation Unit) and the market value of the Deposit\nSecurities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. The \u201c Dividend Equivalent Payment \u201d enables the Fund to make a\ncomplete distribution of dividends on the day preceding the next dividend payment date, and is an amount\nequal, on a per Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on all the portfolio securities of the Fund ( \u201c\nDividend Securities \u201d ) with ex-dividend dates within the accumulation period for such distribution (the \u201c\nAccumulation Period \u201d ), net of expenses and liabilities for such period, as if all of the Dividend\nSecurities had been held by the Fund for the entire Accumulation Period. The Accumulation Period begins on\nthe ex-dividend date for the Fund and ends on the day preceding the next ex-dividend date. If the Cash\nComponent is a positive number (i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the market value of the\nDeposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash Component shall be such positive amount. If the\nCash Component is a negative number (i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit is less than the market\nvalue of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable), the Cash Component shall be such negative\namount and the creator will be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the Cash Component. The Cash\nComponent serves the function of compensating for any differences between the net asset value per Creation\nUnit and the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of the Cash\nComponent excludes any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial\nownership of the Deposit Securities, if applicable, which shall be the sole responsibility of the Authorized\nParticipant (as defined below). The Custodian, through NSCC, makes available on each Business Day, prior to\nthe opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time), the list of the names and the\nrequired number of shares of each Deposit Security or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, to\nbe included in the current standard Fund Deposit (based on information at the end of the previous Business\nDay) for the Fund. Such standard Fund Deposit is subject to any applicable adjustments as described below,\nin order to effect purchases of Creation Units of the Fund until such time as the next-announced composition\nof the Deposit Securities or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, is made available. The\nidentity and number of shares of the Deposit Securities or the amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable,\nrequired for a Fund Deposit for the Fund may be changed from time to time with a view to the investment\nobjective of the Fund. Information regarding a Fund Deposit necessary for the purchase of a Creation Unit is\nmade available to Authorized Participants and other market participants seeking to transact in Creation Unit\naggregations. As noted above, the Trust reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit\nCash to replace any Deposit Security, which shall be added to the Cash Component, including, without\nlimitation, in situations where the Deposit Security: (i) may not be available in sufficient quantity for\ndelivery, (ii) may not be eligible for transfer through the systems of DTC for corporate securities and\nmunicipal securities or the Federal Reserve System for U.S. Treasury securities; (iii) may not be eligible\nfor trading by an Authorized Participant (as defined below) or the investor for which it is acting; (iv)\nwould be restricted under the securities laws or where the delivery of the Deposit Security to the\nAuthorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant\nbecoming restricted under the securities laws, or (v) in certain other situations (collectively, \u201c non-\nstandard orders \u201d ). The Trust also reserves the right to: (i) permit or require the substitution of Deposit\nSecurities in lieu of Deposit Cash; and (ii) include or remove Deposit Securities from the basket in\nanticipation of portfolio changes. The adjustments described above will reflect changes, known to the\nAdviser on the date of announcement to be in effect by the time of delivery of the Fund Deposit, in the\ncomposition of the subject Index being tracked by the Fund or resulting from certain corporate actions.\nPROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS To be eligible to place orders with the Principal Underwriter, as\nfacilitated via the Transfer Agent, to purchase a Creation Unit of the Fund, an entity must be (i) a \u201c\nParticipating Party \u201d , i.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the\nContinuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the \u201c Clearing Process \u201d ), a clearing agency that is\nregistered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see \u201c Book Entry Only System \u201d ), and must have the\nability to clear through the Federal Reserve System. In addition, each Participating Party or DTC\nParticipant (each, an \u201c Authorized Participant \u201d ) must execute a Participant Agreement that has been agreed\nto by the Principal Underwriter and the Transfer Agent, and that has been accepted by the Trust, with\nrespect to purchases and redemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to\nthe terms of a Participant Agreement, on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to\ncertain conditions, including that it will pay to the Trust, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash\nComponent together with the creation transaction fee (described below) and any other applicable fees, taxes\nand additional variable charge.\n\n41\n\nAll orders to purchase Shares directly from the Fund, including non-standard orders, must be placed for one\nor more Creation Units and in the manner and by the time set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or the\napplicable order form. The date on which an order to purchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem Creation\nUnits, as set forth below) is received and accepted is referred to as the \u201c Order Placement Date. \u201d An\nAuthorized Participant may require an investor to make certain representations or enter into agreements with\nrespect to the order (e.g., to provide for payments of cash, when required). Investors should be aware that\ntheir particular broker may not have executed a Participant Agreement and that, therefore, orders to\npurchase Shares directly from the Fund in Creation Units have to be placed by the investor's broker through\nan Authorized Participant that has executed a Participant Agreement. In such cases there may be additional\ncharges to such investor. At any given time, there may be only a limited number of broker-dealers that have\nexecuted a Participant Agreement and only a small number of such Authorized Participants may have\ninternational capabilities. On days when the Exchange or the bond markets close earlier than normal, the\nFund may require orders to create Creation Units to be placed earlier in the day. In addition, if a market\nor markets on which the Fund's investments are primarily traded is closed, the Fund will also generally not\naccept orders on such day(s). Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant by telephone or other\ntransmission method acceptable to the Distributor pursuant to procedures set forth in the Participant\nAgreement and in accordance with the applicable order form. Those placing orders through an Authorized\nParticipant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order by the cut-off\ntime. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure may impede the\nability to reach the Distributor or an Authorized Participant. Fund Deposits must be delivered by an\nAuthorized Participant through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. government securities), or\nthrough DTC (for corporate securities and municipal securities), through a subcustody agent (for foreign\nsecurities) and/or through such other arrangements allowed by the Trust or its agents. With respect to\nforeign Deposit Securities, the Custodian shall cause the subcustodian of the Fund to maintain an account\ninto which the Authorized Participant shall deliver, on behalf of itself or the party on whose behalf it is\nacting, such Deposit Securities. Foreign Deposit Securities must be delivered to an account maintained at\nthe applicable local subcustodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must be ordered by the Authorized Participant\nin a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, to the account of the Fund or its agents by no later than the Settlement Date. The \u201c\nSettlement Date \u201d for the Fund is generally the second Business Day ( \u201c T+2 \u201d ) after the Order Placement\nDate. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable,\nand the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered\nsecurities or cash, as applicable, will be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and\nbinding. The amount of cash represented by the Cash Component must be transferred directly to the Custodian\nthrough the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by the\nCustodian no later than the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities or Deposit\nCash, as applicable, are not received in a timely manner by the Settlement Date, the creation order may be\ncancelled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following\nBusiness Day using a Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Fund. The\ndelivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the second Business Day following\nthe day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor. The order shall be deemed to be\nreceived on the Business Day on which the order is placed provided that the order is placed in proper form\nprior to the applicable cut-off time and the federal funds in the appropriate amount are deposited by 2:00\np.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions), with the Custodian on the Settlement Date. If\nthe order is not placed in proper form as required, or federal funds in the appropriate amount are not\nreceived by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, then\nthe order may be deemed to be rejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable to the Fund for\nlosses, if any, resulting therefrom. A creation request is considered to be in \u201c proper form \u201d if all\nprocedures set forth in the Participant Agreement, order form and this SAI are properly followed.\n\n42\n\nISSUANCE OF A CREATION UNIT Except as provided herein, Creation Units will not be issued until the transfer\nof good title to the Trust of the Deposit Securities or payment of Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the\npayment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the subcustodian has confirmed to the Custodian that\nthe required Deposit Securities (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the\nrelevant subcustodian or subcustodians, the Principal Underwriter and the Adviser shall be notified of such\ndelivery, and the Trust will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Units. In instances where the\nTrust accepts Deposit Securities for the purchase of a Creation Unit, the Creation Unit may be purchased in\nadvance of receipt by the Trust of all or a portion of the applicable Deposit Securities as described below.\nIn these circumstances, the initial deposit will have a value greater than the net asset value of the Shares\non the date the order is placed in proper form since in addition to available Deposit Securities, cash must\nbe deposited in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii) an additional amount of cash\nequal to a percentage of the market value as set forth in the Participant Agreement, of the undelivered\nDeposit Securities (the \u201c Additional Cash Deposit \u201d ), which shall be maintained in a general non-interest\nbearing collateral account. An additional amount of cash shall be required to be deposited with the Trust,\npending delivery of the missing Deposit Securities to the extent necessary to maintain the Additional Cash\nDeposit with the Trust in an amount at least equal to the applicable percentage, as set forth in the\nParticipant Agreement, of the daily marked to market value of the missing Deposit Securities. The Trust may\nuse such Additional Cash Deposit to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time. Authorized Participants\nwill be liable to the Trust for all costs, expenses, dividends, income and taxes associated with missing\nDeposit Securities, including the costs incurred by the Trust in connection with any such purchases. These\ncosts will be deemed to include the amount by which the actual purchase price of the Deposit Securities\nexceeds the market value of such Deposit Securities on the day the purchase order was deemed received by the\nPrincipal Underwriter plus the brokerage and related transaction costs associated with such purchases. The\nTrust will return any unused portion of the Additional Cash Deposit once all of the missing Deposit\nSecurities have been properly received by the Custodian or purchased by the Trust and deposited into the\nTrust. In addition, a transaction fee as set forth below under \u201c Creation Transaction Fees \u201d will be charged\nin all cases and an additional variable charge may also be applied. The delivery of Creation Units so\ncreated generally will occur no later than the Settlement Date. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF CREATION UNITS The\nTrust reserves the right to reject an order for Creation Units transmitted in respect of the Fund at its\ndiscretion, including, without limitation, if (a) the order is not in proper form or the Deposit Securities\ndelivered do not consist of the securities that the Custodian specified; (b) the Deposit Securities or\nDeposit Cash, as applicable, delivered by the Authorized Participant are not as disseminated through the\nfacilities of the NSCC for that date by the Custodian; (c) the investor(s), upon obtaining the Shares\nordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding Shares of the Fund; (d) the acceptance of the\nFund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the acceptance or receipt of the order for a\nCreation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel to the Trust, be unlawful; or (f) in the event that\ncircumstances outside the control of the Trust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent, the Distributor and/or\nthe Adviser make it for all practical purposes not feasible to process orders for Creation Units. Examples\nof such circumstances include acts of God or public service or utility problems such as fires, floods,\nextreme weather conditions and power outages resulting in telephone, telecopy and computer failures; market\nconditions or activities causing trading halts; systems failures involving computer or other information\nsystems affecting the Trust, the Principal Underwriter, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent, DTC, NSCC,\nFederal Reserve System, or any other participant in the creation process, and other extraordinary events.\nThe Trust or its agents shall communicate to the Authorized Participant its rejection of an order. The\nTrust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and the Principal Underwriter are under no duty, however, to give\nnotification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall either of them\nincur any liability for the failure to give any such notification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent, the\nCustodian and the Principal Underwriter shall not be liable for the rejection of any purchase order for\nCreation Units. Given the importance of the ongoing issuance of Creation Units to maintaining a market price\nthat is at or close to the underlying net asset value of the Fund, the Trust does not intend to suspend\nacceptance of orders for Creation Units. All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the\nDeposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of any securities to be\ndelivered shall be determined by the Trust, and the Trust's determination shall be final and binding.\n\n43\n\nREDEMPTION Shares may be redeemed only in Creation Units at their net asset value next determined after\nreceipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Fund through the Transfer Agent and only on a Business\nDay. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE FUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN AMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION\nUNITS. Investors must accumulate enough Shares in the secondary market to constitute a Creation Unit in\norder to have such Shares redeemed by the Trust. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be\nsufficient liquidity in the public trading market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit.\nInvestors should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number\nof Shares to constitute a redeemable Creation Unit. With respect to the Fund, the Custodian, through the\nNSCC, makes available prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m. Eastern time) on\neach Business Day, the list of the names and share quantities of securities designated by the Fund that will\nbe applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form\n(as defined below) on that day ( \u201c Redemption Securities \u201d ). Redemption Securities received on redemption\nmay not be identical to Deposit Securities. The identity and number of shares of the Redemption Securities\nor the Cash Redemption Amount (defined below) may be changed from time to time with a view to the investment\nobjective of the Fund. Redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are paid either in-kind or in cash, or a\ncombination thereof, as determined by the Trust. With respect to in-kind redemptions of the Fund, redemption\nproceeds for a Creation Unit will consist of Redemption Securities plus cash in an amount equal to the\ndifference between the net asset value of the Fund Shares being redeemed, as next determined after a receipt\nof a request in proper form, and the value of the Redemption Securities (the \u201c Cash Redemption Amount \u201d ),\nless a fixed redemption transaction fee and any applicable additional variable charge as set forth below. In\nthe event that the Redemption Securities have a value greater than the net asset value of the Fund Shares, a\ncompensating cash payment equal to the differential is required to be made by or through an Authorized\nParticipant by the redeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Trust's discretion, an\nAuthorized Participant may receive the corresponding cash value of the securities in lieu of the in-kind\nsecurities value representing one or more Redemption Securities. PROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS\nAfter the Trust has deemed an order for redemption received, the Trust will initiate procedures to transfer\nthe requisite Redemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to the Authorized Participant by the\nSettlement Date. With respect to in-kind redemptions of the Fund, the calculation of the value of the\nRedemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be delivered upon redemption will be made by the\nCustodian according to the procedures set forth under \u201c Determination of Net Asset Value \u201d , computed on the\nBusiness Day on which a redemption order is deemed received by the Trust. Therefore, if a redemption order\nin proper form is submitted to the Principal Underwriter by a DTC Participant by the specified time on the\nOrder Placement Date, and the requisite number of Shares of the Fund are delivered to the Custodian prior to\n2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, then the value of\nthe Redemption Securities and the Cash Redemption Amount to be delivered will be determined by the Custodian\non such Order Placement Date. If the requisite number of Shares of the Fund are not delivered by 2:00 p.m.\nor 3:00 p.m. Eastern time (per applicable instructions) on the Settlement Date, the Fund will not release\nthe underlying securities for delivery unless collateral is posted in such percentage amount of missing\nShares as set forth in the Participant Agreement (marked to market daily). With respect to in-kind\nredemptions of the Fund, in connection with taking delivery of shares of Redemption Securities upon\nredemption of Creation Units, an Authorized Participant must maintain appropriate custody arrangements with\na qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the\nRedemption Securities are customarily traded (or such other arrangements as allowed by the Trust or its\nagents), to which account such Redemption Securities will be delivered. Deliveries of redemption proceeds\ngenerally will be made within two Business Days of the trade date. Due to the schedule of holidays in\ncertain countries, however, the delivery of in-kind redemption proceeds may take longer than two Business\nDays after the day on which the redemption request is received in proper form. If the Authorized Participant\nhas not made appropriate arrangements to take delivery of the Redemption Securities in the applicable\nforeign jurisdiction and it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to\neffect deliveries of the Redemption Securities in such jurisdiction, the Trust may, in its discretion,\nexercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash, and the Authorized Participant will be required to\nreceive its redemption proceeds in cash.\n\n44\n\nIf it is not possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of the\nRedemption Securities, the Trust may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such Shares in cash,\nand the redeeming investor will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In addition, an\ninvestor may request a redemption in cash that the Fund may, in its sole discretion, permit. In either case,\nthe investor will receive a cash payment equal to the NAV of its Shares based on the NAV of Shares of the\nFund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a redemption transaction\nfee and additional charge for requested cash redemptions specified above, to offset the Trust's brokerage\nand other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Redemption Securities). The Fund may also, in\nits sole discretion, upon request of a shareholder, provide such redeemer a portfolio of securities that\ndiffers from the exact composition of the Redemption Securities but does not differ in net asset value. An\nAuthorized Participant submitting a redemption request is deemed to represent to the Trust that, as of the\nclose of the Business Day on which the redemption request was submitted, it (or its client) will own (within\nthe meaning of Rule 200 of Regulation SHO) or has arranged to borrow for delivery to the Trust on or prior\nto the Settlement Date of the redemption request, the requisite number of Shares of the Fund to be redeemed\nas a Creation Unit. In either case, the Authorized Participant is deemed to acknowledge that: (i) it (or its\nclient) has full legal authority and legal right to tender for redemption the requisite number of Shares of\nthe Fund and to receive the entire proceeds of the redemption; and (ii) if such Shares submitted for\nredemption have been loaned or pledged to another party or are the subject of a repurchase agreement,\nsecurities lending agreement or any other arrangement affecting legal or beneficial ownership of such Shares\nbeing tendered, there are no restrictions precluding the tender and delivery of such Shares (including\nborrowed shares, if any) for redemption, free and clear of liens, on the redemption Settlement Date. The\nTrust reserves the right to verify these representations at its discretion, but will typically require\nverification with respect to a redemption request from the Fund in connection with higher levels of\nredemption activity and/or short interest in the Fund. If the Authorized Participant, upon receipt of a\nverification request, does not provide sufficient verification of its representations as determined by the\nTrust, the redemption request will not be considered to have been received in proper form and may be\nrejected by the Trust. Redemptions of Shares for Redemption Securities will be subject to compliance with\napplicable federal and state securities laws and the Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash\nredemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Trust could not\nlawfully deliver specific Redemption Securities upon redemptions or could not do so without first\nregistering the Redemption Securities under such laws. An Authorized Participant or an investor for which it\nis acting subject to a legal restriction with respect to a particular security included in the Redemption\nSecurities applicable to the redemption of Creation Units may be paid an equivalent amount of cash. The\nAuthorized Participant may request the redeeming investor of the Shares to complete an order form or to\nenter into agreements with respect to such matters as compensating cash payment. Further, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u201c qualified institutional buyer, \u201d ( \u201c QIB \u201d ) as such term is defined under Rule\n144A of the Securities Act, will not be able to receive Redemption Securities that are restricted securities\neligible for resale under Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may be required by the Trust to provide a\nwritten confirmation with respect to QIB status in order to receive Redemption Securities. The right of\nredemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to the Fund (1) for any period\nduring which the Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (2) for any period\nduring which trading on the Exchange is suspended or restricted; (3) for any period during which an\nemergency exists as a result of which disposal of the Shares of the Fund or determination of the NAV of the\nShares is not reasonably practicable; or (4) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC. CREATION\nAND REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEES A transaction fee, as set forth in the table below, is imposed for the\ntransfer and other transaction costs associated with the purchase or redemption of Creation Units, as\napplicable. Authorized Participants will be required to pay a fixed creation transaction fee and/or a fixed\nredemption transaction fee, as applicable, on a given day regardless of the number of Creation Units created\nor redeemed on that day. The Fund may adjust the transaction fee from time to time. An additional charge or\na variable charge (discussed below) will be applied to certain creation and redemption transactions,\nincluding non-standard orders and whole or partial cash purchases or redemptions. With respect to creation\norders, Authorized Participants are responsible for the costs of transferring the securities constituting\nthe Deposit Securities to the account of the Trust and with respect to redemption orders, Authorized\nParticipants are responsible for the costs of transferring the Redemption Securities from the Trust to their\naccount or on their order. Investors who use the services of a broker or other such intermediary may also be\ncharged a fee for such services.\n\n45\n\nCreation and Redemption Transaction Fees:\n                                                                              \n  Fund                         TransactionFee*,**  MaximumTransactionFee*,**  \n  SPDR Portfolio Treasury ETF                $750                     $3,000  \n                                                                              \n* From time to time, the Fund may waive all or a portion of its applicable transaction fee(s). An additional\ncharge of up to three (3) times the standard transaction fee may be charged to the extent a transaction is\noutside of the clearing process. ** In addition to the transaction fees listed above, the Fund may charge an\nadditional variable fee for creations and redemptions in cash to offset brokerage and impact expenses\nassociated with the cash transaction. The variable transaction fee will be calculated based on historical\ntransaction cost data and the Adviser's view of current market conditions; however, the actual variable fee\ncharged for a given transaction may be lower or higher than the trading expenses incurred by the Fund with\nrespect to that transaction. Determination of Net Asset Value The following information supplements and\nshould be read in conjunction with the sections in the Prospectus entitled \u201c PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION \u201d\nand \u201c ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND SALE INFORMATION. \u201d NAV per Share for the Fund is computed by dividing the\nvalue of the net assets of the Fund (i.e., the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the\ntotal number of Shares outstanding. Expenses and fees, including the management fees, are accrued daily and\ntaken into account for purposes of determining NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by State Street and\ndetermined once daily as of the close of the regular trading session on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m.\nEastern time) on each day that such exchange is open. Creation/redemption order cut-off times may be earlier\non any day that the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (or applicable exchange or market\non which the Fund's investments are traded) announces an early closing time. Any assets or liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at market rates on the\ndate of valuation (generally as of 4:00 p.m. London time) as quoted by one or more sources. In calculating\nthe Fund's net asset value per Share, the Fund's investments are generally valued using market valuations. A\nmarket valuation generally means a valuation (i) obtained from an exchange, a pricing service, or a major\nmarket maker (or dealer) or (ii) based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of value supplied\nby an exchange, a pricing service, or a major market maker (or dealer). The Fund relies on a third-party\nservice provider for assistance with the daily calculation of the Fund's NAV. The third-party service\nprovider, in turn, relies on other parties for certain pricing data and other inputs used in the calculation\nof the Fund's NAV. Therefore, the Fund is subject to certain operational risks associated with reliance on\nits service provider and that service provider's sources of pricing and other data. NAV calculation may be\nadversely affected by operational risks arising from factors such as errors or failures in systems and\ntechnology. Such errors or failures may result in inaccurately calculated NAVs, delays in the calculation of\nNAVs and/or the inability to calculate NAV over extended time periods. The Fund may be unable to recover any\nlosses associated with such failures. In the case of shares of other funds that are not traded on an\nexchange, a market valuation means such fund's published net asset value per share. The Fund may use various\npricing services, or discontinue the use of any pricing service. Fixed-income assets are generally valued as\nof the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange,\nand generally 4:00 p.m. EST for U.S. fixed-income assets. Fixed-income assets are generally valued at the\nmean of the bid and ask prices for bank loans and inflation protected securities, and at the bid price for\nall other fixed-income assets. Pursuant to Board approved valuation procedures, the Board has designated the\nAdviser as the valuation designee for the Fund. These procedures address, among other things, (i)\ndetermining (a) when market quotations are not readily available or reliable and (b) the methodologies to be\nused for determining the fair value of investments, and (ii) the use and oversight of third-party pricing\nservices for fair valuation. The Adviser is responsible for periodically reviewing the procedures, and the\nselected methodologies used, for their continuing appropriateness and accuracy, and making any changes or\nadjustments to the procedures and methodologies as appropriate. In the event that current market valuations\nare not readily available or are deemed unreliable, the Trust's procedures require the Adviser to determine\na security's fair value. In determining a fair value, the Adviser may consider, among other things, (i)\nprice comparisons among multiple sources, (ii) a review of corporate actions and news events, and (iii) a\nreview of relevant financial indicators (e.g., movement in interest rates, market indices, and prices from\nthe Fund's Index provider). In these cases, the Fund's net asset value may reflect certain portfolio\nsecurities' fair values rather than their market prices. The fair value of a portfolio instrument is\ngenerally the price which the Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon its current sale in an orderly\nmarket between market participants. Ascertaining fair value requires a\n\n46\n\ndetermination of the amount that an arm's-length buyer, under the circumstances, would currently pay for the\nportfolio instrument. Fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair\nvalue determination for a security is materially different than the value that could be realized upon the\nsale of the security. In addition, fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used\nto calculate the Fund's net asset value and the prices used by the Index. This may result in a difference\nbetween the Fund's performance and the performance of the Index. Dividends and Distributions The following\ninformation supplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled \u201c\nDISTRIBUTIONS. \u201d GENERAL POLICIES Dividends from net investment income, if any, are generally declared and\npaid monthly by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and\npaid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund to improve\nindex tracking or to comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, in all events\nin a manner consistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act. Dividends and other distributions on Shares are\ndistributed, as described below, on a pro rata basis to Beneficial Owners of such Shares. Dividend payments\nare made through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners then of record with\nproceeds received from the Trust. Management of the Trust reserves the right to declare special dividends\nif, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve the Fund's eligibility\nfor treatment as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes at\nthe Fund level. DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT Broker dealers, at their own discretion, may offer a dividend\nreinvestment service under which Shares are purchased in the secondary market at current market prices.\nInvestors should consult their broker dealer for further information regarding any dividend reinvestment\nservice offered by such broker dealer. Taxes The following is a summary of certain federal income tax\nconsiderations generally affecting the Fund and its shareholders that supplements the discussions in the\nProspectus. No attempt is made to present a comprehensive explanation of the federal, state, local or\nforeign tax treatment of the Fund or its shareholders, and the discussion here and in each Prospectus is not\nintended to be a substitute for careful tax planning. The following general discussion of certain federal\nincome tax consequences is based on the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations issued thereunder as in\neffect on the date of this SAI. New legislation, as well as administrative changes or court decisions, may\nsignificantly change the conclusions expressed herein, and may have a retroactive effect with respect to the\ntransactions contemplated herein. The following information should be read in conjunction with the section\nin the Prospectus entitled \u201c ADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION. \u201d TAXATION OF THE FUND The Fund is treated as a\nseparate corporation for federal income tax purposes. The Fund therefore is considered to be a separate\nentity in determining its treatment under the rules for RICs described herein and in the Prospectus. Losses\nin one series of the Trust do not offset gains in any other series of the Trust and the requirements (other\nthan certain organizational requirements) for qualifying for treatment as a RIC are determined at the Fund\nlevel rather than at the Trust level. The Fund has elected or will elect and intends to qualify each year to\nbe treated as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, the Fund should not\nbe subject to federal income tax on its net investment income and capital gains, if any, to the extent that\nit timely distributes such income and capital gains to its shareholders. In order to qualify for treatment\nas a RIC, the Fund must distribute annually to its shareholders at least the sum of 90% of its taxable net\ninvestment income (generally including the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital\nlosses) and 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income, if any (the \u201c Distribution Requirement \u201d ) and also\n\n47\n\nmust meet several additional requirements. Among these requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of\nthe Fund's gross income each taxable year must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to\ncertain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign\ncurrencies, or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or\ncurrencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships (the \u201c\nQualifying Income Requirement \u201d ); and (ii) at the end of each quarter of the Fund's taxable year, its\nassets must be diversified so that (a) at least 50% of the market value of its total assets must be\nrepresented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other\nsecurities, with such other securities limited, in respect to any one issuer, to an amount not greater in\nvalue than 5% of the value of the Fund's total assets and to not more than 10% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is invested in the\nsecurities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, the\nsecurities (other than securities of other RICs) of two or more issuers that it controls and that are\nengaged in the same, similar, or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified\npublicly traded partnerships (the \u201c Diversification Requirement \u201d ). If the Fund fails to satisfy the\nQualifying Income Requirement or the Diversification Requirement in any taxable year, the Fund may be\neligible for relief provisions if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a\npenalty tax is paid with respect to each failure to satisfy the applicable requirements. Additionally,\nrelief is provided for certain de minimis failures of the Diversification Requirement where the Fund\ncorrects the failure within a specified period of time. In order to be eligible for the relief provisions\nwith respect to a failure to meet the Diversification Requirement, the Fund may be required to dispose of\ncertain assets. If these relief provisions were not available to the Fund and it were to fail to qualify for\ntreatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of its taxable income would be subject to tax at the applicable\ncorporate rate without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and its distributions (including\ncapital gains distributions) generally would be taxable as ordinary income dividends to its shareholders,\nsubject to the dividends-received deduction for corporate shareholders and the lower tax rates on qualified\ndividend income received by noncorporate shareholders. To requalify for treatment as a RIC in a subsequent\ntaxable year, the Fund would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and to\ndistribute any earnings and profits from any year in which the Fund failed to qualify for tax treatment as a\nRIC. If the Fund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, it would generally\nbe required to pay a Fund-level tax on certain net built-in gains recognized with respect to certain of its\nassets upon a disposition of such assets within five years of qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year. The\nBoard reserves the right not to maintain the qualification of the Fund for treatment as a RIC if it\ndetermines such course of action to be beneficial to shareholders. As discussed more fully below, the Fund\nintends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable\nyear. If the Fund meets the Distribution Requirement but retains some or all of its income or gains, it will\nbe subject to federal income tax to the extent any such income or gains are not distributed. The Fund may\ndesignate certain amounts retained as undistributed net capital gain in a notice to its shareholders, who\n(i) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain,\ntheir proportionate shares of the undistributed amount so designated, (ii) will be entitled to credit their\nproportionate shares of the income tax paid by the Fund on that undistributed amount against their federal\nincome tax liabilities and to claim refunds to the extent such credits exceed their liabilities and (iii)\nwill be entitled to increase their tax basis, for federal income tax purposes, in their Shares by an amount\nequal to the excess of the amount of undistributed net capital gain included in their respective income over\ntheir respective income tax credits. If the Fund failed to satisfy the Distribution Requirement for any\ntaxable year, it would be taxed as a regular corporation, with consequences generally similar to those\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph. It may not be possible for the Fund to fully implement sampling\nmethodologies while satisfying the Diversification Requirement. The Fund's efforts to satisfy the\nDiversification Requirement may affect the Fund's execution of its investment strategy and may cause the\nFund's return to deviate from that of the Index, and the Fund's efforts to track the Index may cause it\ninadvertently to fail to satisfy the Diversification Requirement. The Fund will be subject to a 4% excise\ntax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year an\namount at least equal to 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus 98.2% of its capital gain net\nincome for the twelve months ended October 31 of such year, subject to an increase for any shortfall in the\nprior year's distribution. The Fund intends to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the\namounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of this 4% excise tax.\n\n48\n\nThe Fund may elect to treat part or all of any \u201c qualified late year loss \u201d as if it had been incurred in\nthe succeeding taxable year in determining the Fund's taxable income, net capital gain, net short-term\ncapital gain, and earnings and profits. The effect of this election is to treat any such \u201c qualified late\nyear loss \u201d as if it had been incurred in the succeeding taxable year in characterizing Fund distributions\nfor any calendar year. A \u201c qualified late year loss \u201d generally includes net capital loss, net long-term\ncapital loss, or net short-term capital loss incurred after October 31 of the current taxable year (commonly\nreferred to as \u201c post-October losses \u201d ) and certain other late-year losses. Capital losses in excess of\ncapital gains ( \u201c net capital losses \u201d ) are not permitted to be deducted against a RIC's net investment\nincome. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, potentially subject to certain limitations, the Fund\nmay carry a net capital loss from any taxable year forward indefinitely to offset its capital gains, if any,\nin years following the year of the loss. To the extent subsequent capital gains are offset by such losses,\nthey will not result in U.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund and may not be distributed as capital\ngains to its shareholders. Generally, the Fund may not carry forward any losses other than net capital\nlosses. TAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014DISTRIBUTIONS The Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders\nsubstantially all of its investment company taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for\ndividends paid), its net tax-exempt income, if any, and any net capital gain (net recognized long-term\ncapital gains in excess of net recognized short-term capital losses, taking into account any capital loss\ncarryforwards). The Fund will report to shareholders annually the amounts of dividends paid from ordinary\nincome and the amount of distributions of net capital gain. Since the Fund primarily holds investments that\ndo not pay dividends, it is not expected that a substantial portion (if any) of the dividends paid by the\nFund will qualify for either the dividends-received deduction for corporations or the favorable income tax\nrates available to individuals on qualified dividend income. Distributions from the Fund's net short-term\ncapital gains will generally be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. Distributions from the Fund's\nnet capital gain will be taxable to shareholders at long-term capital gains rates, regardless of how long\nshareholders have held their Shares. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed to noncorporate\nshareholders at reduced rates. Although dividends generally will be treated as distributed when paid, any\ndividend declared by the Fund in October, November or December and payable to shareholders of record in such\na month that is paid during the following January will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as\nreceived by shareholders on December 31 of the calendar year in which it was declared. If the Fund's\ndistributions exceed its earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable\nyear may be treated as a return of capital to shareholders. A return of capital distribution generally will\nnot be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower\ncapital loss when the Shares on which the distribution was received are sold. After a shareholder's basis in\nthe Shares has been reduced to zero, distributions in excess of earnings and profits will be treated as gain\nfrom the sale of the shareholder's Shares. Under Section 163(j) of the Code, a taxpayer's business interest\nexpense is generally deductible to the extent of its business interest income plus certain other amounts. If\nthe Fund earns business interest income, it may report a portion of its dividends as \u201c Section 163(j)\ninterest dividends, \u201d which its shareholders may be able to treat as business interest income for purposes\nof Section 163(j) of the Code. The Fund's \u201c Section 163(j) interest dividend \u201d for a tax year will be\nlimited to the excess of its business interest income over the sum of its business interest expense and\nother deductions properly allocable to its business interest income. In general, the Fund's shareholders may\ntreat a distribution reported as a Section 163(j) interest dividend as interest income only to the extent\nthe distribution exceeds the sum of the portions of the distribution reported as other types of tax-favored\nincome. To be eligible to treat a Section 163(j) interest dividend as interest income, a shareholder may\nneed to meet certain holding period requirements in respect of Fund Shares and must not have hedged its\nposition in Fund Shares in certain ways. Distributions that are reinvested in additional Shares of the Fund\nthrough the means of a dividend reinvestment service, if offered by your broker-dealer, will nevertheless be\ntaxable dividends to the same extent as if such dividends had been received in cash. A 3.8% Medicare\ncontribution tax generally applies to all or a portion of the net investment income of a shareholder who is\nan individual and not a nonresident alien for federal income tax purposes and who has adjusted gross income\n(subject to certain adjustments) that exceeds a threshold amount ($250,000 if married filing jointly or if\nconsidered a \u201c surviving spouse \u201d for federal income tax purposes, $125,000 if married filing separately,\nand $200,000 in other cases). This 3.8%\n\n49\n\ntax also applies to all or a portion of the undistributed net investment income of certain shareholders that\nare estates and trusts. For these purposes, interest, dividends and certain capital gains (generally\nincluding capital gain distributions and capital gains realized on the sale of Shares) are generally taken\ninto account in computing a shareholder's net investment income. Distributions of ordinary income and\ncapital gains may also be subject to foreign, state and local taxes depending on a shareholder's\ncircumstances. TAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2014SALE OF SHARES In general, a sale of Shares results in capital gain\nor loss, and for individual shareholders, is taxable at a federal rate dependent upon the length of time the\nShares were held. A sale of Shares held for a period of one year or less at the time of such sale will, for\ntax purposes, generally result in short-term capital gains or losses, and a sale of those held for more than\none year will generally result in long-term capital gains or losses. Long-term capital gains are generally\ntaxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced rates. Gain or loss on the sale of Shares is measured by the\ndifference between the amount received and the adjusted tax basis of the Shares. Shareholders should keep\nrecords of investments made (including Shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends and distributions)\nso they can compute the tax basis of their Shares. A loss realized on a sale of Shares may be disallowed if\nsubstantially identical Shares are acquired (whether through the reinvestment of dividends or otherwise)\nwithin a sixty-one (61) day period beginning thirty (30) days before and ending thirty (30) days after the\ndate that the Shares are disposed of. In such a case, the basis of the Shares acquired must be adjusted to\nreflect the disallowed loss. Any loss upon the sale of Shares held for six (6) months or less will be\ntreated as long-term capital loss to the extent of any amounts treated as distributions to the shareholder\nof long-term capital gain (including any amounts credited to the shareholder as undistributed capital\ngains). COST BASIS REPORTING The cost basis of Shares acquired by purchase will generally be based on the\namount paid for the Shares and then may be subsequently adjusted for other applicable transactions as\nrequired by the Internal Revenue Code. The difference between the selling price and the cost basis of Shares\ngenerally determines the amount of the capital gain or loss realized on the sale or exchange of Shares.\nContact the broker through whom you purchased your Shares to obtain information with respect to the\navailable cost basis reporting methods and elections for your account. TAXATION OF FUND INVESTMENTS\nDividends and interest received by the Fund on foreign securities may give rise to withholding and other\ntaxes imposed by foreign countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the United States may\nreduce or eliminate such taxes. The Fund does not expect to satisfy the requirements for passing through to\nits shareholders any share of any foreign taxes paid by the Fund, with the result that shareholders will not\ninclude such taxes in their gross incomes and will not be entitled to a tax deduction or credit for such\ntaxes on their own returns. Certain of the Fund's investments may be subject to complex provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to hedging transactions, straddles, integrated\ntransactions, foreign currency contracts, forward foreign currency contracts, and notional principal\ncontracts) that, among other things, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund\n(e.g., may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the\nFund and defer losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions\nto shareholders. These provisions also may require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of positions in\nits portfolio (i.e., treat them as if they were closed out) which may cause the Fund to recognize income\nwithout receiving cash with which to make distributions to its shareholders in amounts necessary to satisfy\nthe RIC distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. The Fund intends to monitor its\ntransactions, intends to make appropriate tax elections, and intends to make appropriate entries in its\nbooks and records in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and preserve the Fund's qualification for\ntreatment as a RIC. The Fund is required for federal income tax purposes to mark-to-market and recognize as\nincome for each taxable year its net unrealized gains and losses on certain futures contracts as of the end\nof the year as well as those actually realized during the year. Gain or loss from futures and options\ncontracts on broad-based indexes required to be marked to market will be 60% long-term and 40% short-term\ncapital gain or loss. Application of this rule may alter the timing and character of distributions to\nshareholders. The Fund may be required to defer the recognition of losses on futures contracts, options\n\n50\n\ncontracts and swaps to the extent of any unrecognized gains on offsetting positions held by the Fund. It is\nanticipated that certain net gain realized from the closing out of futures or options contracts will be\nconsidered gain from the sale of securities and therefore will be qualifying income for purposes of the\nQualifying Income Requirement. Investments by the Fund in zero coupon or other discount securities will\nresult in income to the Fund equal to a portion of the excess face value of the securities over their issue\nprice (the \u201c original issue discount \u201d or \u201c OID \u201d ) each year that the securities are held, even though the\nFund may receive no cash interest payments or may receive cash interest payments that are less than the\nincome recognized for tax purposes. In other circumstances, whether pursuant to the terms of a security or\nas a result of other factors outside the control of the Fund, the Fund may recognize income without\nreceiving a commensurate amount of cash. Such income is included in determining the amount of income that\nthe Fund must distribute to maintain its eligibility for treatment as a RIC and to avoid the payment of\nfederal income tax, including the nondeductible 4% excise tax described above. Any market discount\nrecognized on a market discount bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond\nacquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value, or below adjusted issue price if issued\nwith original issue discount. Absent an election by the Fund to include the market discount in income as it\naccrues, gain on the Fund's disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than\ncapital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount. Where the income required to be recognized as a\nresult of the OID and/or market discount rules is not matched by a corresponding cash receipt by the Fund,\nthe Fund may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to enable the Fund to make distributions\nto its shareholders in order to qualify for treatment as a RIC and eliminate taxes at the Fund level.\nSpecial rules apply if the Fund holds inflation-indexed bonds, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected\nSecurities (TIPS). Generally, all stated interest on inflation-indexed bonds is taken into income by the\nFund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of any positive inflation\nadjustment for a taxable year, which results from an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of\nthe bond, is treated as OID. The amount of the Fund's OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will\nincrease the Fund's taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond\nmatures. As a result, the Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distribution\nrequirements for the applicable year. The amount of any negative inflation adjustments, which result from a\ndecrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, first reduces the amount of interest\n(including stated interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includable in the Fund's taxable\nincome with respect to the bond for the taxable year; any remaining negative adjustments will be either\ntreated as ordinary loss or, in certain circumstances, carried forward to reduce the amount of interest\nincome taken into account with respect to the bond in future taxable years. TAX-EXEMPT SHAREHOLDERS Certain\ntax-exempt shareholders, including qualified pension plans, individual retirement accounts, salary deferral\narrangements, 401(k) plans, and other tax-exempt entities, generally are exempt from federal income taxation\nexcept with respect to their unrelated business taxable income ( \u201c UBTI \u201d ). Under current law, the Fund\ngenerally serves to block UBTI from being realized by its tax-exempt shareholders. However, notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, tax-exempt shareholders could realize UBTI by virtue of their investment in the Fund where,\nfor example, (i) the Fund invests in REITs that hold residual interests in real estate mortgage investment\nconduits ( \u201c REMICs \u201d ) or (ii) Shares constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt\nshareholders within the meaning of section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Charitable remainder trusts\nare subject to special rules and should consult their tax advisors. The IRS has issued guidance with respect\nto these issues and prospective shareholders, especially charitable remainder trusts, are strongly\nencouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding these issues. Certain tax-exempt educational\ninstitutions will be subject to a 1.4% tax on net investment income. For these purposes, certain dividends\nand capital gain distributions, and certain gains from the disposition of Shares (among other categories of\nincome), are generally taken into account in computing a shareholder's net investment income. FOREIGN\nSHAREHOLDERS Dividends, other than capital gains dividends, \u201c short-term capital gain dividends \u201d and \u201c\ninterest-related dividends \u201d (described below), paid by the Fund to shareholders who are nonresident aliens\nor foreign entities will be subject to a 30% United States withholding tax unless a reduced rate of\nwithholding or a withholding exemption is provided under applicable treaty law to the extent derived from\ninvestment income and short-term capital gain or unless such income is effectively connected with a U.S.\ntrade or business carried on through a permanent establishment in the United States.\n\n51\n\nNonresident shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of the\nUnited States withholding tax and the proper withholding form(s) to be submitted to the Fund. A non-U.S.\nshareholder who fails to provide an appropriate IRS Form W-8 may be subject to backup withholding at the\nappropriate rate. Dividends reported by the Fund as (i) interest-related dividends, to the extent such\ndividends are derived from the Fund's \u201c qualified net interest income, \u201d or (ii) short-term capital gain\ndividends, to the extent such dividends are derived from the Fund's \u201c qualified short-term gain, \u201d are\ngenerally exempt from this 30% withholding tax. \u201c Qualified net interest income \u201d is the Fund's net income\nderived from U.S.-source interest and original issue discount, subject to certain exceptions and\nlimitations. \u201c Qualified short-term gain \u201d generally means the excess of the Fund's net short-term capital\ngain for the taxable year over its net long-term capital loss, if any. In the case of Shares held through an\nintermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if the Fund reports the payment as an interest-related\ndividend or as a short-term capital gain dividend. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries\nwith respect to the application of these rules to their accounts. Unless certain non-U.S. entities that hold\nShares comply with IRS requirements that will generally require them to report information regarding U.S.\npersons investing in, or holding accounts with, such entities, a 30% withholding tax may apply to Fund\ndistributions payable to such entities. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the withholding described\nin this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and a foreign government,\nprovided that the shareholder and the applicable foreign government comply with the terms of such agreement.\nBACKUP WITHHOLDING The Fund will be required in certain cases to withhold (as \u201c backup withholding \u201d ) on\namounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided the Fund either an incorrect tax identification\nnumber or no number at all, (2) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report\npayments of interest or dividends, (3) has failed to certify to the Fund that such shareholder is not\nsubject to backup withholding, or (4) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a\nU.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. Backup withholding will not be applied\nto payments that have been subject to the 30% withholding tax on shareholders who are neither citizens nor\npermanent residents of the U.S. CREATION UNITS An Authorized Participant who exchanges securities for\nCreation Units generally will recognize a gain or a loss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference\nbetween the market value of the Creation Units at the time and the sum of the exchanger's aggregate basis in\nthe securities surrendered plus the amount of cash paid for such Creation Units. A person who redeems\nCreation Units will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the exchanger's basis\nin the Creation Units and the sum of the aggregate market value of any securities received plus the amount\nof any cash received for such Creation Units. The IRS, however, may assert that a loss realized upon an\nexchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing \u201c wash\nsales, \u201d or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position. Any gain or loss\nrealized upon a creation of Creation Units will be treated as capital gain or loss if the Authorized\nParticipant holds the securities exchanged therefor as capital assets, and otherwise will be ordinary income\nor loss. Similarly, any gain or loss realized upon a redemption of Creation Units will be treated as capital\ngain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Shares comprising the Creation Units as capital assets,\nand otherwise will be ordinary income or loss. Any capital gain or loss realized upon the creation of\nCreation Units will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the securities exchanged for\nsuch Creation Units have been held for more than one year, and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or\nloss. Any capital gain or loss realized upon the redemption of Creation Units will generally be treated as\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the Shares comprising the Creation Units have been held for more than one\nyear, and otherwise, will generally be short-term capital gain or loss. Any capital loss realized upon a\nredemption of Creation Units held for six (6) months or less will be treated as a long-term capital loss to\nthe extent of any amounts treated as distributions to the applicable Authorized Participant of long-term\ncapital gains with respect to the Creation Units (including any amounts credited to the Authorized\nParticipant as undistributed capital gains). The Fund has the right to reject an order for Creation Units if\nthe purchaser (or a group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the\noutstanding shares of the Fund and if, pursuant to section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund would\nhave a basis in any deposit securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of\ndeposit. The Fund also has the right to require information necessary to determine\n\n52\n\nbeneficial Share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination. If the Fund does issue Creation Units to a\npurchaser (or a group of purchasers) that would, upon obtaining the Shares so ordered, own 80% or more of\nthe outstanding shares of the Fund, the purchaser (or a group of purchasers) may not recognize gain or loss\nupon the exchange of securities for Creation Units. If the Fund redeems Creation Units in cash, it may bear\nadditional costs and recognize more capital gains than it would if it redeems Creation Units in kind.\nPersons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax\ntreatment of any creation or redemption transaction. CERTAIN POTENTIAL TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Under\npromulgated Treasury regulations, if a shareholder recognizes a loss on disposition of the Fund's shares of\n$2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder (or\ncertain greater amounts over a combination of years), the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure\nstatement on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this\nreporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not excepted. A shareholder who\nfails to make the required disclosure to the IRS may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including\nsignificant penalties. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal\ndetermination of whether the taxpayer's treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their\ntax advisers to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.\nThe foregoing discussion is a summary only and is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning.\nPurchasers of Shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of investing in such\nShares, including under state, local and other tax laws. Finally, the foregoing discussion is based on\napplicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, judicial authority and administrative\ninterpretations in effect on the date hereof. Changes in applicable authority could materially affect the\nconclusions discussed above, and such changes often occur. STATE TAX MATTERS The discussion of state and\nlocal tax treatment is based on the assumptions that the Fund will qualify for treatment under Subchapter M\nof the Internal Revenue Code as RICs and that the Fund will distribute all interest and dividends it\nreceives to its shareholders. The tax discussion summarizes general state and local tax laws which are\ncurrently in effect and which are subject to change by legislative, judicial or administrative action; any\nsuch changes may be retroactive with respect to the Fund's applicable transactions. Investors should consult\na tax advisor for more detailed information about state and local taxes to which they may be subject. Many\nstates grant tax-free status to dividends paid to you from interest earned on direct obligations of the U.S.\ngovernment, subject in some states to minimum investment requirements that must be met by the Fund.\nInvestment in Government National Mortgage Association ( \u201c Ginnie Mae \u201d ) or Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation ( \u201c Fannie Mae \u201d ) securities, banker's acceptances, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements\ncollateralized by U.S. government securities do not generally qualify for such tax-free treatment. The rules\non exclusion of this income are different for corporate shareholders. Capital Stock and Other Securities The\nFund issues Shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per Share. The Board may designate additional\nfunds. Each Share issued by the Trust has a pro rata interest in the assets of the corresponding series of\nthe Trust. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely\ntransferable. Each Share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and distributions declared by the\nBoard with respect to the Fund, and in the net distributable assets of the Fund on liquidation. Each Share\nhas one vote with respect to matters upon which a shareholder vote is required consistent with the\nrequirements of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Shares of all series of the Trust ( \u201c\nFunds \u201d ) vote together as a single class except that if the matter being voted on affects only a particular\nfund it will be voted on only by that fund and if a matter affects a particular fund differently from other\nFunds, that fund will vote separately on such matter. Under Massachusetts law, the Trust is not required to\nhold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to\n\n53\n\ndo so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless\nrequired to do so under the 1940 Act. All Shares of the Trust (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative\nvoting rights for the election of Trustees. Under Massachusetts law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by\nvote of the shareholders. Under Massachusetts law, shareholders of a business trust may, under certain\ncircumstances, be held personally liable as partners for obligations of the Trust. However, the Declaration\nof Trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the Trust,\nrequires that Trust obligations include such disclaimer, and provides for indemnification and reimbursement\nof expenses out of the Trust's property for any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of\nthe Trust. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is\nlimited to circumstances in which the Trust itself would be unable to meet its obligations. Given the above\nlimitations on shareholder personal liability, and the nature of the Fund's assets and operations, the risk\nto shareholders of personal liability is believed to be remote. Shareholder inquiries may be made by writing\nto the Trust, c/o the Distributor, State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC at One Iron Street,\nBoston, Massachusetts 02210. Counsel and Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Morgan, Lewis &\nBockius LLP, located at 1111 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004, serves as counsel to the Trust.\nErnst & Young LLP, located at 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, serves as the independent\nregistered public accounting firm of the Trust. Ernst & Young LLP performs annual audits of the Fund's\nfinancial statements and provides other audit, tax and related services. Local Market Holiday Schedules The\nTrust generally intends to effect deliveries of portfolio securities on a basis of \u201c T \u201d plus two Business\nDays (i.e., days on which the NYSE is open) in the relevant foreign market of the Fund. The ability of the\nTrust to effect in-kind redemptions within two Business Days of receipt of a redemption request is subject,\namong other things, to the condition that, within the time period from the date of the request to the date\nof delivery of the securities, there are no days that are local market holidays on the relevant Business\nDays. For every occurrence of one or more intervening holidays in the local market that are not holidays\nobserved in the United States, the redemption settlement cycle may be extended by the number of such\nintervening local holidays. In addition to holidays, other unforeseeable closings in a foreign market due to\nemergencies may also prevent the Trust from delivering securities within two Business Days. The securities\ndelivery cycles currently practicable for transferring portfolio securities to redeeming investors, coupled\nwith local market holiday schedules, may require a delivery process longer than the standard settlement\nperiod. In certain circumstances during the calendar year, the settlement period may be greater than seven\ncalendar days. Financial Statements The Fund had not commenced operations as of the date of this SAI and\ntherefore does not have financial information to report for the Trust's June 30, 2023 fiscal year end.\n\n54\n\nAPPENDIX A Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global ( \u201c S&P \u201d ), Long-Term Issue Ratings:\n                                                                                                            \n                         An obligation rated \u2018AAA' has the highest rating assigned by S&P Global Ratings.   \n  AAA                    The obligor'scapacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation is       \n                         extremely strong.                                                                  \n                         An obligation rated \u2018AA' differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a      \n  AA                     small degree. Theobligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on the       \n                         obligation is very strong.                                                         \n                         An obligation rated \u2018A' is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of     \n  A                      changes incircumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated   \n                         categories. However,the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on    \n                         the obligation is still strong.                                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However,        \n  BBB                    adverse economicconditions or changing circumstances are more likely to weaken     \n                         the obligor's capacity to meetits financial commitments on the obligation.         \n                         Obligations rated \u2018BB', \u2018B', \u2018CCC', \u2018CC', and \u2018C' are regarded as having           \n                         significant speculativecharacteristics. \u2018BB' indicates the least degree of         \n  BB, B, CCC, CC, and C  speculation and \u2018C' the highest. While suchobligations will likely have some       \n                         quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighedby large            \n                         uncertainties or major exposure to adverse conditions.                             \n                         An obligation rated \u2018BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative   \n  BB                     issues.However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse        \n                         business, financial, oreconomic conditions that could lead to the obligor's        \n                         inadequate capacity to meet its financialcommitments on the obligation.            \n                         An obligation rated \u2018B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated    \n                         \u2018BB', but theobligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments  \n  B                      on the obligation. Adversebusiness, financial, or economic conditions will likely  \n                         impair the obligor's capacity or willingnessto meet its financial commitments on   \n                         the obligation.                                                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent   \n                         uponfavorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to      \n  CCC                    meet its financialcommitments on the obligation. In the event of adverse           \n                         business, financial, or economicconditions, the obligor is not likely to have the  \n                         capacity to meet its financial commitments on theobligation.                       \n                         An obligation rated \u2018CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The \u2018CC'    \n  CC                     rating is usedwhen a default has not yet occurred but S&P Global Ratings expects   \n                         default to be a virtualcertainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.   \n                         An obligation rated \u2018C' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the      \n  C                      obligation isexpected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery  \n                         compared with obligationsthat are rated higher.                                    \n                         An obligation rated \u2018D' is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For      \n                         non-hybrid capitalinstruments, the \u2018D' rating category is used when payments on    \n                         an obligation are not made onthe date due, unless S&P Global Ratings believes      \n                         that such payments will be made within fivebusiness days in the absence of a       \n  D                      stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated graceperiod or 30          \n                         calendar days.

The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category;\nthe modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of\nthat generic rating category. Additionally, a \u201c (hyb) \u201d indicator is appended to all ratings of hybrid\nsecurities issued by banks, insurers, finance companies, and securities firms.* Note: For more information\non long-term ratings assigned to obligations in default, please see the definition \u201c Long-Term Credit\nRatings for Defaulted or Impaired Securities \u201d in the Other Definitions section of Moody's Rating Symbols\nand Definitions publication. * By their terms, hybrid securities allow for the omission of scheduled\ndividends, interest, or principal payments, which can potentially result in impairment if such an omission\noccurs. Hybrid securities may also be subject to contractually allowable write-downs of principal that could\nresult in impairment. Together with the hybrid indicator, the long-term obligation rating assigned to a\nhybrid security is an expression of the relative credit risk associated with that security. Fitch Ratings\nLtd.'s ( \u201c Fitch \u201d ) Corporate Finance Obligations \u2013 Long-Term Ratings: AAA: Highest Credit Quality. \u2018AAA'\nratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally\nstrong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely\naffected by foreseeable events. AA: Very High Credit Quality. \u2018AA' ratings denote expectations of very low\ncredit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not\nsignificantly vulnerable to foreseeable events. A: High Credit Quality. \u2018A' ratings denote expectations of\nlow credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may,\nnevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher\nratings. BBB: Good Credit Quality. \u2018BBB' ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently\nlow. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate, but adverse business or\neconomic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. BB: Speculative. \u2018BB' ratings indicate an\nelevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic\nconditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial\ncommitments to be met. B: Highly Speculative. \u2018B' ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.\nCCC: Substantial Credit Risk. \u2018CCC' ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present. CC: Very High\nLevels of Credit Risk. \u2018CC' ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk. C: Exceptionally High Levels\nof Credit Risk. \u2018C' indicates exceptionally high levels of credit risk.\n\nA-2\n\nAppendix B SPDR \u00ae Series Trust\nSPDR \u00ae Index Shares Funds\nSSGA Active Trust\n(each, a \u201c Trust \u201d or \u201c Fund, \u201d and, collectively, the \u201c Trusts \u201d or \u201c Funds \u201d ) PROXY VOTING POLICY AND\nPROCEDURES The Board of Trustees of the Trusts has adopted the following policy and procedures with respect\nto voting proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Trusts' investment portfolios. 1. Proxy\nVoting Policy The policy of each Trust is to delegate the responsibility for voting proxies relating to\nportfolio securities held by the Trusts to SSGA Funds Management, Inc., the Trusts' investment adviser (the\n\u201c Adviser \u201d ), subject to the Trustees' continuing oversight. 2. Fiduciary Duty The right to vote proxies\nwith respect to portfolio securities held by each Trust is an asset of the Trusts. The Adviser acts as a\nfiduciary of the Trusts and must vote proxies in a manner consistent with the best interest of the Trusts\nand its shareholders. 3. Proxy Voting Procedures A. At least annually, the Adviser shall present to the\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d ) its policies, procedures and other guidelines for voting proxies ( \u201c\nPolicy \u201d ) and the Policy of any Sub-adviser (defined below) to which proxy voting authority has been\ndelegated (see Section 9 below). In addition, the Adviser shall notify the Board of material changes to its\nPolicy or the Policy of any Sub-adviser promptly and no later than the next regular meeting of the Board\nafter such amendment is implemented. B. At least annually, the Adviser shall present to the Board its policy\nfor managing the conflicts of interests that may arise through the Adviser's proxy voting activities. In\naddition, the Adviser shall report any Policy overrides involving portfolio securities held by the Trusts to\nthe Trustees at the next regular meeting of the Board after such override(s) occur. C. At least annually,\nthe Adviser shall inform the Trustees that a record is available for each proxy voted with respect to\nportfolio securities of each Trust during the year. Also see Section 5 below. 4. Revocation of Authority to\nVote The delegation by the Trustees of the authority to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities of the\nTrusts may be revoked by the Trustees, in whole or in part, at any time. 5.

Form N-PX is required to be filed not later than August 31 of each year. 6. Retention and\nOversight of Proxy Advisory Firms A. In considering whether to retain or continue retaining a particular\nproxy advisory firm, the Adviser will ascertain whether the proxy advisory firm has the capacity and\ncompetency to adequately analyze proxy issues, act as proxy voting agent as requested, and implement the\nPolicy. In this regard, the Adviser will consider, at least annually, among other things, the adequacy and\nquality of the proxy advisory firm's staffing and personnel and the robustness of its policies and\nprocedures regarding its ability to identify and address any conflicts of interest. The Adviser shall, at\nleast annually, report to the Board regarding the results of this review.\n\nB-1\n\nB. The Adviser will request quarterly and annual reporting from any proxy advisory firm retained by the\nAdviser, and hold ad hoc meetings with such proxy advisory firm, in order to determine whether there has\nbeen any business changes that might impact the proxy advisory firm's capacity or competency to provide\nproxy voting advice or services or changes to the proxy advisory firm's conflicts policies or procedures.\nThe Adviser will also take reasonable steps to investigate any material factual error, notified to the\nAdviser by the proxy advisory firm or identified by the Adviser, made by the proxy advisory firm in\nproviding proxy voting services. 7. Periodic Sampling The Adviser will periodically sample proxy votes to\nreview whether they complied with the Policy. 8. Disclosures A. A Trust shall include in its registration\nstatement: 1. A description of this policy and of the policies and procedures used by the Adviser to\ndetermine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities; and 2. A statement disclosing that\ninformation regarding how the Trust voted proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent\ntwelve-month period ended June 30 is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Trust's toll-\nfree telephone number; or through a specified Internet address; or both; and on the Securities and Exchange\nCommission's (the \u201c SEC \u201d ) website.

Sub-\nAdvisers For certain Funds, the Adviser retains investment management firms ( \u201c Sub-advisers \u201d ) to provide\nday-to-day investment management services to the Trusts pursuant to sub-advisory agreements. It is the\npolicy of the Trusts that the Adviser may delegate proxy voting authority with respect to a Fund to a Sub-\nadviser. Pursuant to such delegation, a Sub-adviser is authorized to vote proxies on behalf of the\napplicable Fund or Funds for which it serves as sub-adviser, in accordance with the Sub-adviser's proxy\nvoting policies and procedures. 10.

We       \n                                     expect companies to observe the relevant laws and regulations of       \n  Regional Nuances                   their respective markets, as well as country specific best practice    \n                                     guidelines and corporate governance codes and to publicly disclose     \n                                     their level of compliance with the applicable provisions and           \n                                     requirements. Except where specified, this Policy applies globally.    \n  Our Proxy Voting and Engagement    We have organized our proxy voting and engagement program around       \n  Principles                         three broad principles:                                                \n                                     We believe that well-governed companies can protect and pursue         \n                                     shareholder interests better and withstand the challenges of an        \n                                     uncertain economic environment. As such, we seek to vote director      \n                                     elections in a way that we believe will maximize long-term value.      \n                                     Principally, a board acts on behalf of shareholders by protecting      \n                                     their interests and preserving their rights. In order to carry out     \n                                     their primary responsibilities, directors undertake activities that    \n                                     include setting strategy and providing guidance on strategic matters,  \n                                     selecting the CEO and other senior executives, overseeing executive    \n                                     management, creating a succession plan for the board and management,   \n                                     and providing effective oversight of material risks and opportunities  \n                                     relevant to their business. Further, good corporate governance         \n                                     necessitates the existence of effective internal controls and risk     \n  Effective Board Oversight          management systems, which should be governed by the board. \u00a0 We view   \n                                     board quality as a measure of director independence, director          \n                                     succession planning, board diversity, evaluations and refreshment,     \n                                     and company governance practices. We believe independent directors     \n                                     are crucial to good corporate governance; they help management         \n                                     establish sound corporate governance policies and practices. We        \n                                     believe a sufficiently independent board is key to effectively         \n                                     monitoring management, maintaining appropriate governance practices,   \n                                     and performing oversight functions necessary to protect shareholder    \n                                     interests. We also believe the right mix of skills, independence,      \n                                     diversity, and qualifications among directors provides boards with     \n                                     the knowledge and direct experience to manage risks and operating      \n                                     structures that are often complex and industry-specific. We vote for   \n                                     the (re-)election of directors on a case-by-case basis after           \n                                     considering various                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nC-6                                                                                                         \n     \n  7  \n     \n                                                                                                            \n                            factors set forth in this Policy, including, but not limited to, board          \n                            quality, general market practice, and availability of information on director   \n                            skills and expertise. When voting in director elections, we do so on behalf of  \n                            and in the best interest of the funds and client accounts we manage and do not  \n                            seek to change or influence control of the company.                             \n                            It is important for shareholders to receive timely and accurate reporting of a  \n                            company\u2019s financial performance and strategy so that they are able to assess    \n                            both the value and risk of their investment. In addition to information         \n                            related to strategy and performance, companies should also provide disclosure   \n  Disclosure                relating to their approach to corporate governance and shareholder rights.      \n                            Such information allows investors to determine whether their economic           \n                            interests have been protected by the board and provides insights into the       \n                            quality of the board\u2019s oversight of management. Ultimately, the board of        \n                            directors is accountable for the oversight and disclosure of the material       \n                            risks and opportunities faced by the company.                                   \n                            State Street Global Advisors believes it is in the best interest of             \n                            shareholders for companies to have appropriate shareholder rights and           \n                            accountability mechanisms in place. As a starting place for voting rights, it   \n                            is necessary for ownership rights to reflect one vote for one share to ensure   \n                            that economic interests and proxy voting power are aligned. This share          \n                            structure best supports the shareholders\u2019 right to exercise their proxy vote    \n                            on matters that are important to the protection of their investment such as     \n  Shareholder Protection    share issuances and other dilutive events, authorization of strategic           \n                            transactions, approval of a shareholder rights plan, and changes to the         \n                            corporate bylaws or charter, among others. In terms of accountability           \n                            mechanisms, we believe there should be annual elections of the full board of    \n                            directors. The ability to elect, remove and nominate directors on at least an   \n                            annual basis provides the appropriate checks and balances to ensure that the    \n                            board of directors are undertaking their responsibilities in the best           \n                            interests of their shareholders.                                                \n                            When voting our clients\u2019 proxies, we may be presented with shareholder          \n                            proposals at portfolio companies that must be evaluated on a case-by-case       \n  Shareholder Proposals     basis and in accordance with the principles set forth above. For proposals      \n                            related to commonly requested disclosure topics, we have also developed the     \n                            criteria found in Appendix A to assess the effectiveness of disclosure on such  \n                            topics in connection with these types of proposals.                             \n                            State Street Global Advisors\u2019 engagement activities provides a meaningful       \n                            shareholder tool that we believe protects and enhances the long-term economic   \n                            value of the holdings in our clients\u2019 accounts.

We believe a sufficiently      \n                                          independent board is key to effectively monitoring management,    \n                                          maintaining appropriate governance practices, and performing      \n  Board Independence                      oversight functions necessary to protect shareholder interests.   \n                                          We have developed a set of criteria for determining board         \n                                          independence, which varies by region and/or local jurisdiction.   \n                                          These criteria generally follow relevant listing standards,       \n                                          local regulatory requirements and/or local market practice        \n                                          standards.

Although we recognize that board structures may vary by jurisdiction,  \n                       where a board has established an audit committee and/or compensation/remuneration    \n                       committee, we generally expect the committee to be primarily, and in some cases,     \n                       fully independent.                                                                   \n                       State Street Global Advisors believes that a well-constituted board of directors,    \n  Board Composition    with a balance of skills, expertise, and independence, provides the foundation for   \n                       a well-governed company.                                                             \n                       Refreshment and Tenure We may withhold votes from directors if overall average       \n                       board tenure is excessive. In assessing excessive tenure, we consider factors such   \n                       as the preponderance of long tenured directors, board refreshment practices, and     \n                       classified board structures.                                                         \n                       Generally, we may vote against age and term limits unless the company is found to    \n                       have poor board refreshment and director succession practices, and has a             \n                       preponderance of non-executive directors with excessively long tenures serving on    \n                       the board.                                                                           \n                       Director Time Commitments We consider if a company publicly discloses its director   \n                       time commitment policy (e.g., within corporate governance guidelines, proxy          \n                       statement, company website).

Boards should also have a regular        \n                          evaluation process in place to assess the effectiveness of the board and the      \n                          skills of board members to address issues, such as emerging risks, changes to     \n                          corporate strategy, and diversification of operations and geographic footprint.   \n                          We believe nominating committees are best positioned to evaluate the skillset     \n                          and expertise of both existing and prospective board members. However, we may     \n                          take such considerations into account in certain circumstances, such as           \n                          contested elections.                                                              \n                          Oversight of Strategy and Risk We believe that risk management is a key function  \n                          of the board, which is responsible for setting the overall risk appetite of a     \n                          company and for providing oversight on the risk management process established    \n                          by senior executives at a company. We allow boards to have discretion regarding   \n  Board Accountability    the ways in which they provide oversight in this area. However, we expect         \n                          companies to disclose how the board provides oversight on its risk management     \n                          system and risk identification. Boards should also review existing and emerging   \n                          risks that evolve in tandem with the changing political and economic landscape    \n                          or as companies diversify or expand their operations into new areas.              \n                          As responsible stewards, we believe in the importance of effective risk           \n                          management and oversight of issues that are material to a company. To             \n                          effectively manage and assess the risk of our clients\u2019 portfolios, we expect our  \n                          portfolio companies to manage risks and opportunities that are material and       \n                          industry-specific and that have a demonstrated link to long-term value creation,  \n                          and to provide high-quality disclosure of this process to shareholders.           \n                          Consistent with this perspective, we may seek to engage with our portfolio        \n                                                                                                            \nC-11                                                                                                        \n      \n  12  \n      \n                                                      \n  companies to better understand how their boards     \n  are overseeing risks and opportunities the company  \n  has deemed to be material to its business or        \n  operations. If we believe that a company has        \n  failed to implement and communicate effective       \n  oversight of these risks, we may consider voting    \n  against the responsible directors.

Despite the        \n  differences among the possible types of plans and   \n  the awards, there is a simple underlying            \n  philosophy that guides our analysis of executive    \n  compensation:                                       \n  we believe that there should be a direct            \n  relationship between executive compensation and     \n  company performance over the long term.             \n  Shareholders should have the opportunity to assess  \n  whether pay structures and levels are aligned with  \n  business performance. When assessing remuneration   \n  reports, we consider factors such as adequate       \n  disclosure of various remuneration elements,        \n  absolute and relative pay levels, peer selection    \n  and benchmarking, the mix of long-term and          \n  short-term incentives, alignment of pay structures  \n  with shareholder interests, as well as with         \n  corporate strategy and performance. We may oppose   \n  remuneration reports where pay seems misaligned     \n  with shareholders\u2019 interests. We may also consider  \n  executive compensation practices when re-electing   \n  members of the compensation committee.              \n  For example, criteria we may consider include the   \n  following:                                          \n                                                      \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aOverall quantum relative to company performance  \n  \u2022 Vesting periods and length of performance         \n  targets                                             \n  \u2022 Mix of performance, time and options-based stock  \n  units                                               \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aUse of special grants and one-time awards        \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aRetesting and repricing features                 \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aDisclosure and transparency                      \n  Board Responsiveness to Advisory Votes              \n  a.

In addition, if    \n  the level of dissent against a management proposal  \n  on executive pay is consistently high, and we have  \n  determined that a vote against a pay-related        \n  proposal is warranted in the third consecutive      \n  year, we may vote against the Chair of the          \n  compensation committee.                             \n                                                      \nC-14                                                                                                        \n      \n  15  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n                                   b.

As a         \n  result, we have a longstanding commitment to        \n  enhancing investor-useful disclosure around this    \n  topic.                                              \n  We find that the recommendations of the Taskforce   \n  on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)     \n  provide an effective framework for disclosure of    \n  climate-related risks and opportunities. We         \n  believe all companies should provide public         \n  disclosures in accordance with the following four   \n  pillars of the Taskforce for Climate-related        \n  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework:             \n  \u2022 Governance The TCFD recommends companies          \n  describe the board\u2019s oversight of, and              \n  management\u2019s role in, assessing and managing        \n  climate-related risks and opportunities.            \n  \u2022 Strategy The TCFD recommends companies describe   \n  identified climate-related risks and opportunities  \n  and the impact of these risks and opportunities on  \n  their businesses, strategy, and financial           \n  planning.                                           \n  \u2022 Risk Management The TCFD recommends companies     \n  describe processes for identifying, assessing, and  \n  managing climate-related risks and describe how     \n  these processes are integrated into overall risk    \n  management.                                         \n  \u2022 Metrics and Targets The TCFD recommends           \n  companies disclose metrics and targets used to      \n  assess and manage climate-related risks and         \n  opportunities.                                      \n  \u2014 State Street Global Advisors is not prescriptive  \n  on target setting. We expect companies that have    \n  adopted net zero ambitions to disclose interim      \n  climate targets.6 If a company chooses not to       \n  disclose any climate targets, we expect the         \n  company to provide an explanation on how the        \n  company measures and monitors progress on managing  \n  climate-related risks and opportunities in line     \n  with the recommendations of TCFD.                   \n  \u2014 TCFD recommends the disclosure of Scope 1, Scope  \n  2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 emissions. We       \n  expect companies to identify and disclose the most  \n  relevant categories of Scope 3 emissions as         \n  defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate    \n  Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting      \n  Standard. However, we recognize that Scope 3        \n  emissions estimates have a high degree of           \n  uncertainty; therefore, if the company determines   \n  that categories of Scope 3 are impracticable to     \n  estimate, we instead encourage companies to         \n  explain these limitations. We do not expect         \n  companies to set Scope 3 targets. We do encourage   \n  companies to explain any efforts to address Scope   \n  3 emissions in line with TCFD, such as engagement   \n  with suppliers, customers, or other stakeholders    \n  across the value chain, where relevant.             \n  6. \u201cNet zero ambitions\u201d are defined by State        \n  Street Global Advisors as a public                  \n  statement/commitment to align the company\u2019s         \n  emissions to third party frameworks or pathways     \n  for net zero.                                       \n                                                      \nC-16                                                                                                        \n      \n  17  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n                                         We may take voting action against directors serving at companies   \n                                         in the following indexes that fail to provide sufficient           \n                                         disclosure regarding: (i)\u00a0board oversight of climate-related       \n                                         risks and opportunities; (ii)\u00a0total direct and indirect GHG        \n                                         emissions (\u201cScope 1\u201d and \u201cScope 2\u201d emissions); (iii)               \n                                         climate-related targets, in accordance with the TCFD framework:    \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aS&P 500                                                         \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aS&P/TSX Composite                                               \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aFTSE 350                                                        \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aSTOXX 600                                                       \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aASX 200                                                         \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aTOPIX 100                                                       \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aHang Seng                                                       \n                                         \u2022\u2002\u200aStraits Times Index                                             \n                                         We may waive the guideline if a company engages with State Street  \n                                         Global Advisors and provides a specific, timebound plan for        \n                                         providing the expected disclosures.                                \n                                         Say-on-Climate Proposals While we are generally supportive of      \n                                         effective climate- related disclosure, we currently do not         \n                                         endorse an annual advisory climate vote. We have reservations      \n                                         with the potential unintended consequences of such a vote,         \n                                         including insulating directors from accountability, distracting    \n                                         from existing disclosure frameworks, and straining investors\u2019      \n                                         limited proxy voting resources.

The approval of capital       \n                                         raising activities is fundamental to a shareholder\u2019s               \n                                                                                                            \nC-17                                                                                                        \n      \n  18  \n      \n                                                      \n  ability to monitor the amounts of proceeds and to   \n  ensure capital is deployed efficiently. Altering    \n  the capital structure of a company is a critical    \n  decision for boards. When making such a decision,   \n  we believe the company should disclose a            \n  comprehensive business rationale that is            \n  consistent with corporate strategy and not overly   \n  dilutive to its shareholders.                       \n  Our approach to share capital structure matters     \n  may vary by local market and jurisdiction, due to   \n  regional nuances. Such proposals may include:       \n                                                      \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aIncrease in Authorized Common Shares             \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aIncrease in Authorized Preferred Shares          \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aUnequal Voting Rights                            \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aShare Repurchase Programs                        \n  Dividend Payouts We generally support dividend      \n  payouts that constitute 30 percent or more of net   \n  income. We may vote against a dividend payout if    \n  the dividend payout ratio has been consistently     \n  below 30 percent without adequate explanation. We   \n  may also vote against if the payout is excessive    \n  given the company\u2019s financial position. Particular  \n  attention will be warranted when the payment may    \n  damage the company\u2019s long-term financial health.    \n  Reorganization, Mergers and Acquisitions The        \n  reorganization of the structure of a company or     \n  mergers often involve proposals relating to         \n  reincorporation, restructurings, liquidations, and  \n  other major changes to the corporation.             \n  Proposals that are in the best interests of the     \n  shareholders, demonstrated by enhancing share       \n  value or improving the effectiveness of the         \n  company\u2019s operations, will generally be supported.  \n  We evaluate mergers and structural reorganizations  \n  on a case-by-case basis. We will generally support  \n  transactions that maximize shareholder value. Some  \n  of the considerations include the following:        \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aOffer premium                                    \n  \u2022\u2002\u200aStrategic rationale                              \n  \u2022 Board oversight of the process for the            \n  recommended transaction, including, director and/   \n  or management conflicts of interest                 \n  \u2022 Offers made at a premium and where there are no   \n  other higher bidders                                \n  \u2022 Offers in which the secondary market price is     \n  substantially lower than the net asset value        \n                                                      \nC-18                                                                                                        \n      \n  19  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n                        We may vote against a transaction considering the following:                        \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aOffers with potentially damaging consequences for minority shareholders because  \n                        of illiquid stock                                                                   \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aOffers where we believe there is a reasonable prospect for an enhanced bid or    \n                        other bidders                                                                       \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aThe current market price of the security exceeds the bid price at the time of    \n                        voting                                                                              \n                        Related-Party Transactions Some companies have a controlled ownership structure     \n                        and complex cross-shareholdings between subsidiaries and parent companies           \n                        (\u201crelated companies\u201d). Such structures may result in the prevalence of              \n                        related-party transactions between the company and its various stakeholders, such   \n                        as directors and management, subsidiaries and shareholders. In markets where        \n                        shareholders are required to approve such transactions, we expect companies to      \n                        disclose details of the transaction, such as the nature, the value and the purpose  \n                        of such a transaction. We also encourage independent directors to ratify such       \n                        transactions. Further, we encourage companies to describe the level of independent  \n                        board oversight and the approval process, including details of any independent      \n                        valuations provided by financial advisors on related-party transactions.            \n                        Cross-Shareholdings (Japan Only) \u201cCross-shareholdings\u201d are a long-standing feature  \n                        of the balance sheets of many Japanese companies, but, in our view, can be          \n                        detrimental for corporate governance practices and ultimately shareholder returns.  \n                        Therefore, State Street Global Advisors may vote against the board leader at the    \n                        TOPIX 500 companies where the \u201ccross-shareholdings\u201d (strategic listed shares) held  \n                        by a company exceed 30\u00a0percent of the company\u2019s net assets (as in the securities    \n                        report disclosed for the previous fiscal year).                                     \n                        We may waive the guideline if a company engages with State Street Global Advisors   \n                        and provides a specific, timebound, and publicly available plan for reducing its    \n                        exposure to \u201ccross-shareholdings\u201d:                                                  \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aTo less than 30% by 2025; or                                                     \n                        \u2022\u2002\u200aBy 50% of current level by 2025                                                  \n                        Proxy Access (North America Only) In general, we believe that proxy access is a     \n                        fundamental right and an accountability mechanism for all long-term shareholders.   \n  Shareholder Rights    We consider proposals relating to proxy access on a case-by-case basis. We          \n                        generally support shareholder proposals that set parameters to empower long-term    \n                        shareholders while providing management the flexibility to design a process that    \n                        is appropriate for the company\u2019s circumstances.                                     \n                                                                                                            \nC-19                                                                                                        \n      \n  20  \n      \n                                                      \n  Vote Standards                                      \n  a. Annual Elections We generally support the        \n  establishment of annual elections of the board of   \n  directors. Consideration is given to the overall    \n  level of board independence and the independence    \n  of the key committees, as well as the existence of  \n  a shareholder rights plan.                          \n  b. Majority Voting We generally support a majority  \n  vote standard based on votes cast for the election  \n  of directors. We generally vote to support          \n  amendments to bylaws that would require simple      \n  majority of voting shares (i.e. shares cast) to     \n  pass or to repeal certain provisions.               \n  Shareholder Meetings                                \n  a. Special Meetings and Written Consent In          \n  general, we support the ability for shareholders    \n  to call special meetings, as well as act by         \n  written consent. We believe an appropriate          \n  threshold for both calling a special meeting and    \n  acting by written consent can be 25% of             \n  outstanding shares or less.                         \n  b. Notice Period to Convene a General Meeting We    \n  expect companies to give as much notice as is       \n  practicable when calling a general meeting.         \n  Generally, we are not supportive of authorizations  \n  seeking to reduce the notice period to less than    \n  14 days.                                            \n  c. Virtual/Hybrid Shareholder Meetings We           \n  generally support proposals that grant boards the   \n  right to hold shareholder meetings in a virtual or  \n  hybrid format as long as companies uphold the       \n  following best practices:                           \n  \u2022 Afford virtual attendee shareholders the same     \n  rights as would normally be granted to in-person    \n  attendee shareholders                               \n  \u2022 Commit to time-bound renewal (five years or       \n  less) of meeting format authorization by            \n  shareholders                                        \n  \u2022 Provide a written record of all questions posed   \n  during the meeting, and                             \n  \u2022 Comply with local market laws and regulations     \n  relating to virtual and hybrid shareholder meeting  \n  practices                                           \n  \u2022 If a company breaches any of the criteria above,  \n  we may vote against the chair of the nominating     \n  committee.                                          \n  \u2022 In evaluating these proposals we also consider    \n  the operating environment of the company,           \n  including local regulatory developments and         \n  specific market circumstances impacting virtual     \n  meeting practices.                                  \n                                                      \nC-20                                                                                                        \n      \n  21  \n      \n                                                                                                            \n  Governance Documents & Miscellaneous    Article Amendments                                                \n  Items                                                                                                     \n                                          a. Unilateral Amendments We may withhold votes from directors of  \n                                          companies that have unilaterally adopted/amended company bylaws   \n                                          that negatively impact shareholder rights (such as fee-shifting,  \n                                          forum selection, and exclusion service bylaws) without putting    \n                                          such amendments to a shareholder vote.                            \n                                          b. Super-Majority We generally vote against amendments to bylaws  \n                                          requiring super-majority shareholder votes to pass or repeal      \n                                          certain provisions. \u00a0 We generally vote for the reduction or      \n                                          elimination of super-majority vote requirements, unless           \n                                          management of the issuer was concurrently seeking to or had       \n                                          previously made such a reduction or elimination.                  \n                                          c. Board Size We generally support proposals seeking to fix the   \n                                          board size or designate a range for the board size and vote       \n                                          against proposals that give management the ability to alter the   \n                                          size of the board outside of a specified range without            \n                                          shareholder approval.                                             \n                                          Anti-Takeover Issues Occasionally, companies add anti-takeover    \n                                          provisions that reduce the chances of a potential acquirer to     \n                                          make an offer, or to reduce the likelihood of a successful        \n                                          offer. We generally do not support proposals that reduce          \n                                          shareholders\u2019 rights, entrench management, or reduce the          \n                                          likelihood of shareholders\u2019 right to vote on reasonable offers.   \n                                          Our approach to anti-takeover issues may vary by local market     \n                                          and jurisdiction, due to regional nuances. However, we will       \n                                          generally support mandates requiring shareholder approval of a    \n                                          shareholder rights plans (\u201cpoison pill\u201d) and repeals of various   \n                                          anti-takeover related provisions.                                 \n                                          When appropriate, we may vote for an amendment to a shareholder   \n                                          rights plan where the terms of the new plans are more favorable   \n                                          to shareholders\u2019 ability to accept unsolicited offers (i.e., if   \n                                          one of the following conditions are met: (i)\u00a0minimum trigger,     \n                                          flip-in or flip-over of 20\u00a0percent, (ii)\u00a0maximum term of three    \n                                          years, (iii)\u00a0no \u201cdead hand,\u201d \u201cslow hand,\u201d \u201cno hand\u201d nor similar   \n                                          feature that limits the ability of a future board to redeem the   \n                                          pill, and (iv)\u00a0inclusion of a shareholder redemption feature      \n                                          (qualifying offer clause), permitting ten percent of the shares   \n                                          to call a special meeting or seek a written consent to vote on    \n                                          rescinding the pill if the board refuses to redeem the pill 90    \n                                          days after a qualifying offer is announced).                      \n                                          Accounting and Audit-Related Issues Companies should have robust  \n                                          internal audit and internal control systems designed for          \n                                          effective management of any potential and emerging risks to       \n                                          company operations and strategy. The responsibility of setting    \n                                          out an internal audit function lies with the audit committee,     \n                                          which should have independent non-executive directors designated  \n                                          as members.                                                       \n                                          We believe the disclosure and availability of reliable financial  \n                                          statements in a timely manner is imperative for investment        \n                                          analysis. As a result, board oversight of the internal controls   \n                                          and the independence of the audit process are essential if        \n                                          investors are to rely upon financial statements.

When appointing external auditors and         \n                                       approving audit fees, we will take into consideration the level of   \n                                       detail in company disclosures.

Board of Directors\n\nVoting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections\n\nFour fundamental principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:\n\nIndependence:Boards should be sufficiently independent from management (and significant shareholders) to\nensure that they are able and motivated to effectively supervise management\u2019s performance for the benefit of\nall shareholders, including in setting and monitoring the execution of corporate strategy, with appropriate\nuse of shareholder capital, and in setting and monitoring executive compensation programs that support that\nstrategy. The chair of the board should ideally be an independent director, and all boards should have an\nindependent leadership position or a similar role in order to help provide appropriate counterbalance to\nexecutive management, as well as having sufficiently independent committees that focus on key governance\nconcerns such as audit, compensation, and nomination of directors.\n\nComposition:Companies should ensure that directors add value to the board through their specific skills and\nexpertise and by having sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size\nappropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and collaborative\nparticipation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range\nof perspectives.\n\nResponsiveness:Directors should respond to investor input, such as that expressed through significant\nopposition to management proposals, significant support for shareholder proposals (whether binding or non-\nbinding),and tender offers where a majority of shares are tendered.\n\nAccountability:Boards should be sufficiently accountable to shareholders, including through transparency of\nthe company\u2019s governance practices and regular board elections, by the provision of sufficient information\nfor shareholders to be able to assess directors and board composition, and through the ability of\nshareholders to remove directors.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following circumstances (with\nnew nominees 1 considered on case-by-casebasis):\n\nIndependence\n\nVote againstor withhold from non-independentdirectors (Executive Directors and Non-Independent Non-\nExecutiveDirectors perISS\u2019 Classification of Directors) when:\n                                                                         \n  \u25fe    Independent directors comprise 50\u00a0percent or less of the board;  \n                                                                         \n                                                                                                  \n  \u25fe    The non-independent director serves on the audit, compensation, or nominating committee;  \n                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so that the full board functions  \n        as that committee; or                                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if the board attests that the independent     \n        directors fulfill the functions of such a committee.                                                \n                                                                                                            \n1 A \u201cnew nominee\u201d is a director who is being presented for election by shareholders for the first time.\nRecommendations on new nominees who have served for less than one year are made on a case-by-case basis\ndepending on the timing of their appointment and the problematic governance issue in question.\n\n2 In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use \u201cWithhold\u201d as the contrary vote option in\ndirector elections; companies with a majority vote standard use \u201cAgainst\u201d. However, it will vary by company\nand the proxy must be checked to determine the valid contrary vote option for the particular company.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Current interim officers are included in this category. For private companies, the equivalent\npositions are applicable. A non-employee director serving as an officer due to statutory requirements (e.g.\ncorporate secretary) will generally be classified as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director under \u201cAny\nmaterial relationship with the company.\u201d However, if the company provides explicit disclosure that the\ndirector is not receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000 per year for serving in that capacity,\nthen the director will be classified as an Independent Director.\n\n2. \u201cAffiliate\u201d includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS uses 50 percent control\nownership by the parent company as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor\nof an externally managed issuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate.\n\n3. Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO).\n\n4. When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) serving on the board of an\nacquired company, ISS will generally classify such directors as independent unless determined otherwise\ntaking into account the following factors: the applicable listing standards determination of such director\u2019s\nindependence; any operating ties to the firm; and the existence of any other conflicting relationships or\nrelated party transactions.\n\n5.ISS will look at the terms of the interim officer\u2019s employment contract to determine if it contains\nseverance pay, long-term health and pension benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained\nin contracts of permanent, non-temporary CEOs. ISS will also consider if a formal search process was under\nway for a full-time officer at the time.\n\n6.\u201cImmediate family member\u201d follows the SEC\u2019s definition of such and covers spouses, parents, children,\nstep-parents, step-children, siblings, in-laws, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the\nhousehold of any director, nominee for director, executive officer, or significant shareholder of the\ncompany.\n\n7. Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature, generally involve access to sensitive\ncompany information or to strategic decision-making, and typically have a commission- or fee-based payment\nstructure. Professional services generally include but are not limited to the following: investment\nbanking/financial advisory services, commercial banking (beyond deposit services), investment services,\ninsurance services, accounting/audit services, consulting services, marketing services, legal services,\nproperty management services, realtor services, lobbying services, executive search services, and IT\nconsulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional relationships and not\nprofessional services: deposit services, IT tech support services, educational services, and construction\nservices. The case of participation in a banking syndicate by a non-lead bank should be considered a\ntransactional (and hence subject to the associated materiality test) rather than a professional\nrelationship. \u201cOf Counsel\u201d relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive\nany form of compensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a retired partner of, the firm\nproviding the professional service. The case of a company providing a professional service to one of its\ndirectors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional\nrather than a professional relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be\nprofessional services unless the company explains why such services are not advisory.\n\n8. A material transactional relationship, including grants to non-profit organizations, exists if the\ncompany makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity, exceeding the greater\nof: $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient\u2019s gross revenues, for a company that follows NASDAQ listing\nstandards; or the greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient\u2019s gross revenues, for a company that\nfollows NYSE listing standards. For a company that follows neither of the preceding standards, ISS will\napply the NASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient is the party receiving the financial proceeds from\nthe transaction).\n\n9. Dissident directors who are parties to a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement\nmay be classified as Independent Directors if an analysis of the following factors indicates that the voting\nagreement does not compromise their alignment with all shareholders\u2019 interests: the terms of the agreement;\nthe duration of the standstill provision in the agreement; the limitations and requirements of actions that\nare agreed upon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and if there any\nconflicting relationships or related party transactions.\n\n10.Interlocks include: executive officers serving as directors on each other\u2019s compensation or similar\ncommittees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board); or executive officers sitting on each\nother\u2019s boards and at least one serves on the other\u2019s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence\nof such a committee, on the board).\n\n11.

An exception\nwill be made if there was at least one woman on the board at the preceding annual meeting and the board\nmakes a firm commitment to return to a gender-diverse status within a year.\n\nRacial and/or Ethnic Diversity:For companies in the Russell 3000 or S&P 1500 indices, generally vote against\nor withhold from the chair of the nominating committee (or other directors on a case-by-casebasis) where the\nboard has no apparent racially or ethnically diverse members 5. An exception will be made if there was\nracial and/or ethnic diversity on the board at the preceding annual meeting and the board makes a firm\ncommitment to appoint at least one racial and/or ethnic diverse member within a year.\n\n3 Nominees who served for only part of the fiscal year are generally exempted from the attendance policy.\n\n4 Although all of a CEO\u2019s subsidiary boards with publicly-traded common stock will be counted as separate\nboards, ISS will not recommend a withhold vote for the CEO of a parent company board or any of the\ncontrolled (>50 percent ownership) subsidiaries of that parent but may do so at subsidiaries that are less\nthan 50 percent controlled and boards outside the parent/subsidiary relationships.\n\n5 Aggregate diversity statistics provided by the board will only be considered if specific to racial and/or\nethnic diversity.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Shareholder Rights & Defenses\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon advance notice proposals, giving support to those proposals which\nallow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as reasonably possible and\nwithin the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice for company,\nregulatory, and shareholder review.\n\nTo be reasonable, the company\u2019s deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/nominations must be no earlier\nthan 120 days prior to the anniversary of the previous year\u2019s meeting and have a submittal window of no\nshorter than 30 days from the beginning of the notice period (also known as a 90-120-day window). The\nsubmittal window is the period under which shareholders must file their proposals/nominations prior to the\ndeadline.\n\nIn general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent\u2019s\neconomic and voting position in the company so long as the informational requirements are reasonable and\naimed at providing shareholders with the necessary information to review such proposals.\n\nAmend Bylaws without Shareholder Consent\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote against proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.\n\nVote case-by-case on proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition to shareholders,\ntaking into account the following:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Any impediments to shareholders\u2019 ability to amend the bylaws (i.e. supermajority voting             \n        requirements);                                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                          \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s ownership structure and historical voting turnout;  \n                                                                          \n                                                                           \n  \u25fe    Whether the board could amend bylaws adopted by shareholders; and  \n                                                                           \n                                                                                                 \n  \u25fe    Whether shareholders would retain the ability to ratify any board-initiated amendments.  \n                                                                                                 \nControl Share Acquisition Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing so\nwould enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to shareholders.\n\nVote against proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.\n\nVote for proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.\n\nControl share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting rights when they contribute to\nownership in excess of certain thresholds. Voting rights for those shares exceeding ownership limits may\nonly be restored by approval of either a majority or supermajority of disinterested shares. Thus, control\nshare acquisition statutes effectively require a hostile bidder to put its offer to a shareholder vote or\nrisk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder continues buying up a large block of shares.\n\nControl Share Cash-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of control share cash-outstatutes.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

In other words, when an investor\ncrosses a preset threshold level, remaining shareholders are given the right to sell their shares to the\nacquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.\n\nDisgorgement Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.\n\nDisgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a certain percentage of a\ncompany\u2019s stock to disgorge, or pay back, to the company any profits realized from the sale of that\ncompany\u2019s stock purchased 24 months before achieving control status. All sales of company stock by the\nacquirer occurring within a certain period of time (between 18 months and 24 months) prior to the investor\u2019s\ngaining control status are subject to these recapture-of-profits provisions.\n\nFair Price Provisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon proposals to adopt fair price provisions (provisions that\nstipulate that an acquirer must pay the same price to acquire all shares as it paid to acquire the control\nshares), evaluating factors such as the vote required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required\nto repeal the fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.\n\nGenerally vote against fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements greater than a majority of\ndisinterested shares.\n\nFreeze-OutProvisions\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to opt out of state freeze-outprovisions. Freeze-outprovisions\nforce an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a company to wait a specified period of\ntime before gaining control of the company.\n\nGreenmail\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote for proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise\nrestrict a company\u2019s ability to make greenmail payments.\n\nVote case-by-case on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or bylaw amendments.\n\nGreenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock from individuals or groups\nseeking control of the company. Since only the hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial\npremium over the market value of its shares, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.\n\nShareholder Litigation Rights\n\nFederal Forum Selection Provisions\n\nFederal forum selection provisions require that U.S. federal courts be the sole forum for shareholders to\nlitigate claims arising under federal securities law.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

The comprehensiveness  \n        of the sales process (e.g., full auction, partial auction, no auction) can also affect shareholder  \n        value.                                                                                              \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Conflicts of interest - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction disproportionately and         \n        inappropriately as compared to non-insider shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the  \n        directors and officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger than if they   \n  \u25fe    did not hold these interests. Consider whether these interests may have influenced these directors  \n        and officers to support or recommend the merger. The CIC figure presented in the \u201cISS Transaction   \n        Summary\u201d section of this report is an aggregate figure that can in certain cases be a misleading    \n        indicator of the true value transfer from shareholders to insiders. Where such figure appears to    \n        be excessive, analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether a potential conflict exists.  \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

Additionally, a private company discount may be applied to the        \n        target if it is a private entity.                                                                   \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Market reaction - How has the market responded to the proposed deal? A negative market reaction     \n  \u25fe    may be a cause for concern. Market reaction may be addressed by analyzing the one-day impact on     \n        the unaffected stock price.                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Deal timing - A main driver for most transactions is that the SPAC charter typically requires the   \n  \u25fe    deal to be complete within 18 to 24 months, or the SPAC is to be liquidated. Evaluate the           \n        valuation, market reaction, and potential conflicts of interest for deals that are announced close  \n        to the liquidation date.                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Negotiations and process - What was the process undertaken to identify potential target companies   \n  \u25fe    within specified industry or location specified in charter? Consider the background of the          \n        sponsors.                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Conflicts of interest - How are sponsors benefiting from the transaction compared to IPO            \n        shareholders? Potential conflicts could arise if a fairness opinion is issued by the insiders to    \n        qualify the deal rather than a third party or if management is encouraged to pay a higher price     \n  \u25fe    for the target because of an 80\u00a0percent rule (the charter requires that the fair market value of    \n        the target is at least equal to 80\u00a0percent of net assets of the SPAC). Also, there may be sense of  \n        urgency by the management team of the SPAC to close the deal since its charter typically requires   \n        a transaction to be completed within the 18-24-month timeframe.                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Voting agreements - Are the sponsors entering into enter into any voting agreements/tender offers   \n  \u25fe    with shareholders who are likely to vote against the proposed merger or exercise conversion         \n        rights?                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Governance - What is the impact of having the SPAC CEO or founder on key committees following the   \n        proposed merger?                                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

Other times,    \n        the SPAC has entered into a definitive transaction agreement, but needs additional time to          \n        consummate or hold the shareholder meeting.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Added incentive for non-redeeming shareholders: Sometimes the SPAC sponsor (or other insiders)      \n        will contribute, typically as a loan to the company, additional funds that will be added to the     \n  \u25fe    redemption value of each public share as long as such shares are not redeemed in connection with    \n        the extension request.

SVT is expressed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and\nincludes the new shares proposed, shares available under existing plans, and shares granted but unexercised\n(using two measures, in the case of plans subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, as noted above).\nAll award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on the most expensive types of\nawards (for example, full-value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the\nmost expensive types.\n\nFor proposals that are not subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is\nreasonable if it falls below a company-specific benchmark. The benchmark is determined as follows: The top\nquartile performers in each industry group (using the Global Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are\nidentified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are established based on these top performers\u2019 historic\nSVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly correlated\nto SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the specific company by\nplugging the company-specific performance measures, size, and cash compensation into the industry cap\nequations to arrive at the company\u2019s benchmark.22\n\nThree-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate\n\nA \u201cValue-Adjusted Burn Rate\u201d is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks are\ncalculated as the greater of: (1) an industry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the\ncompany\u2019s GICS group segmented by S&P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&P 500) and non-Russell 3000 index;\nand (2) a de minimisthreshold established separately for each of the S&P 500, the Russell 3000 index less\nthe S&P 500, and the non-Russell 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be limited to a\npredetermined range above or below the prior year\u2019s burn-rate benchmark.\n\nThe Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is calculated as follows:\n\nValue-Adjusted Burn Rate = ((# of options * option\u2019s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-\nvalue awards * stock price)) / (Weighted average common shares * stock price).\n\nEgregious Factors\n\nLiberal Change in Control Definition\n\nGenerally vote against equity plans if the plan has a liberal definition of change in control and the equity\nawards could vest upon such liberal definition of change in control, even though an actual change in control\nmay not occur. Examples of such a definition include, but are not limited to, announcement or commencement\nof a tender offer, provisions for acceleration upon a \u201cpotential\u201d takeover, shareholder approval of a merger\nor other transactions, or similar language.\n\n22 For plans evaluated under the Equity Plan Scorecard policy, the company\u2019s SVT benchmark is considered\nalong with other factors.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

The proposal should clearly articulate why the board is choosing to conduct an exchange program at\nthis point in time. Repricing underwater options after a recent precipitous drop in the company\u2019s stock\nprice demonstrates poor timing and warrants additional scrutiny. Also, consider the terms of the surrendered\noptions, such as the grant date, exercise price and vesting schedule. Grant dates of surrendered options\nshould be far enough back (two to three years) so as not to suggest that repricings are being done to take\nadvantage of short-term downward price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of surrendered options\nshould be above the 52-week high for the stock price.\n\nVote for shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.\n\nStock Plans in Lieu of Cash\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Vote case-by-caseon plans that provide participants with the option of taking all or\na portion of their cash compensation in the form of stock.\n\nVote for non-employee director-only equity plans that provide a dollar-for-dollar cash-for-stock exchange.\n\nVote case-by-case on plans which do not provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for stock exchange.

In an effort to capture the total cost of total\ncompensation, ISS will not make any adjustments to carve out the in-lieu-of cash compensation.\n\nTransfer Stock Option (TSO) Programs\n\nGeneral Recommendation:One-timeTransfers: Vote against or withhold from compensation committee members if\nthey fail to submit one-timetransfers to shareholders for approval.\n\nVote case-by-case on one-time transfers.

Standard stock options    \n        and performance-accelerated awards do not meet the criteria to be considered as performance-based   \n        awards. Further, premium-priced options should have a meaningful premium to be considered           \n        performance-based awards.                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        Second, assess the rigor of the company\u2019s performance-based equity program. If the bar set for the  \n        performance-based program is too low based on the company\u2019s historical or peer group comparison,    \n  \u25fe    generally vote for the proposal. Furthermore, if target performance results in an above target      \n        payout, vote for the shareholder proposal due to program\u2019s poor design. If the company does not     \n        disclose the performance metric of the performance-based equity program, vote for the shareholder   \n        proposal regardless of the outcome of the first step to the test.                                   \n                                                                                                            \nIn general, vote for the shareholder proposal if the company does not meet both of the above two steps.\n                                                               \n  W W W .

Many companies have adopted policies that permit recoupment in cases where\nan executive\u2019s fraud, misconduct, or negligence significantly contributed to a restatement of financial\nresults that led to the awarding of unearned incentive compensation. However, such policies may be narrow\ngiven that not all misconduct or negligence may result in significant financial restatements.

Social and Environmental Issues\n\nGlobal Approach \u2013 E&S Shareholder Proposals\n\nISS applies a common approach globally to evaluating social and environmental proposals which cover a wide\nrange of topics, including consumer and product safety, environment and energy, labor standards and human\nrights, workplace and board diversity, and corporate political issues. While a variety of factors goes into\neach analysis, the overall principle guiding all vote recommendations focuses on how the proposal may\nenhance or protect shareholder value in either the short or long term.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote case-by-case,examining primarily whether implementation of the\nproposal is likely to enhance or protect shareholder value. The following factors will be considered:\n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    If the issues presented in the proposal are being appropriately or effectively dealt with through   \n        legislation or government regulation;                                                               \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    If the company has already responded in an appropriate and sufficient manner to the issue(s)        \n        raised in the proposal;                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                          \n  \u25fe    Whether the proposal\u2019s request is unduly burdensome (scope or timeframe) or overly prescriptive;  \n                                                                                                          \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s approach compared with any industry standard practices for addressing the issue(s)    \n        raised by the proposal;                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    Whether there are significant controversies, fines, penalties, or litigation associated with the    \n        company\u2019s practices related to the issue(s) raised in the proposal;                                 \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether reasonable and       \n  \u25fe    sufficient information is currently available to shareholders from the company or from other        \n        publicly available sources; and                                                                     \n                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                            \n        If the proposal requests increased disclosure or greater transparency, whether implementation       \n  \u25fe    would reveal proprietary or confidential information that could place the company at a competitive  \n        disadvantage.                                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \nEndorsement of Principles\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote against proposals seeking a company\u2019s endorsement of principles that\nsupport a particular public policy position. Endorsing a set of principles may require a company to take a\nstand on an issue that is beyond its own control and may limit its flexibility with respect to future\ndevelopments.\n\nManagement and the board should be afforded the flexibility to make decisions on specific public policy\npositions based on their own assessment of the most beneficial strategies for the company.\n\nAnimal Welfare\n\nAnimal Welfare Policies\n\nGeneral Recommendation:Generally vote for proposals seeking a report on a company\u2019s animal welfare\nstandards, or animal welfare-related risks, unless:\n                                                                                                      \n  \u25fe    The company has already published a set of animal welfare standards and monitors compliance;  \n                                                                                                      \n                                                                       \n  \u25fe    The company\u2019s standards are comparable to industry peers; and  \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                            \n  \u25fe    There are no recent significant fines, litigation, or controversies related to the company\u2019s        \n        and/or its suppliers\u2019 treatment of animals.                                                         \n                                                                                                            \n                                                               \n  W W W .

Persons Controlled By or Under Common Control With Registrant The Board of Trustees of the Trust is\nthe same as the Boards of Trustees of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA Active Trust. In addition, the\nofficers of the Trust are substantially identical to the officers of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA Active\nTrust. Additionally, the Trust\u2019s investment adviser, SSGA FM, also serves as investment adviser to each\nseries of SPDR Index Shares Funds and SSGA Active Trust. Nonetheless, the Trust takes the position that it\nis not under common control with other trusts because the power residing in the respective boards and\nofficers arises as the result of an official position with the respective trusts. Additionally, see the\n\u201cControl Persons and Principal Holders of Securities\u201d section of the Statement of Additional Information for\na list of shareholders who own more than 5% of a specific fund\u2019s outstanding shares and such information is\nincorporated by reference to this Item. Item 30. Indemnification Pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Registrant\u2019s\nAmended and Restated Declaration of Trust and under Section 4.9 of the Registrant\u2019s By-Laws, the Trust will\nindemnify any person who is, or has been, a Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust against all\nexpenses reasonably incurred or paid by him/her in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding in\nwhich he/she becomes involved as a party or otherwise by virtue of his/her being or having been a Trustee,\nofficer, employee or agent and against amounts paid or incurred\n\nby him/her in the settlement thereof, if he/she acted in good faith and in a manner he/she reasonably\nbelieved to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal\naction or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his/her conduct was unlawful. In addition,\nindemnification is permitted only if it is determined that the actions in question did not render him/her\nliable by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of his/her duties\nor by reason of reckless disregard of his/her obligations and duties to the Registrant. The Registrant may\nalso advance money for litigation expenses provided that Trustees, officers, employees and/or agents give\ntheir undertakings to repay the Registrant unless their conduct is later determined to permit\nindemnification. Pursuant to Section 5.2 of the Registrant\u2019s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, no\nTrustee, officer, employee or agent of the Registrant shall be liable for any action or failure to act,\nexcept in the case of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or reckless disregard of duties to\nthe Registrant. Pursuant to paragraph 9 of the Registrant\u2019s Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser shall\nnot be liable for any action or failure to act, except in the case of willful misfeasance, bad faith or\ngross negligence or reckless disregard of duties to the Registrant. Insofar as indemnification for liability\narising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cAct\u201d) may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling\npersons of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions of Rule 484 under the Act, or otherwise, the Registrant\nhas been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed\nin the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such\nliabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or\ncontrolling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is\nasserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered,\nthe Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling\nprecedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is\nagainst public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\nThe Registrant hereby undertakes that it will apply the indemnification provision of its By-Laws in a manner\nconsistent with Release 11330 of the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940\nAct\u201d), so long as the interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i) thereunder remains in effect. The\nRegistrant maintains insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Trustee, officer, employee or agent\nof the Registrant, or who is or was serving at the request of the Registrant as a trustee, director,\nofficer, employee or agent of another trust or corporation, against any liability asserted against him/her\nand incurred by him/her or arising out of his/her position. However, in no event will the Registrant\nmaintain insurance to indemnify any such person for any act for which the Registrant itself is not permitted\nto indemnify him/her. Item 31.
