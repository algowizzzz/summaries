(based on a hypothetical $10,000 Investment)                    \nHow did the Fund perform last year and what affected its performance? Global concerns around heightened     \ninflation, changes in central bank policies, geopolitical risks in the Middle East and a stronger US Dollar \nwere primary drivers of Fund performance during the reporting period. The year 2024 saw a number of global  \ncentral banks begin easing after keeping rates high to combat sticky inflation in 2023. However, the path to\neasing was anything but smooth, as growth and other economic data generally remained strong, and as such the\nspeed and magnitude of policy easing was pared back for many central banks, particularly in the US. This led\nto substantial volatility within international bond markets as investors contended with uncertainty of the  \nfuture path of interest rates. Risk appetite was further impacted by uncertainty surrounding the incoming US\nPresident\u2019s policies regarding taxes, energy, trade, and regulatory policies and how they would impact      \nbroader global markets. In addition, a surge in the US dollar in the fourth quarter caused a negative drag  \non local currency returns. The Fund uses forwards to manage currency exposure, particularly when there are  \nflows around month end, and for currency exposure purposes during market holidays and in the event of       \nchallenging liquidity in bond markets.                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

(based on a hypothetical $10,000 Investment)                    \nHow did the Fund perform last year and what affected its performance? Global concerns around heightened     \ninflation and changes in central bank policies were primary drivers of Fund performance during the reporting\nperiod. The Fund performed in line with expectations. The year 2024 saw a number of global central banks    \nbegin easing after keeping rates high to combat sticky inflation in 2023. The European Central Bank and the \nU.S. Federal Reserve both cut rates by 100 basis points in 2024, while the Bank of England kept cuts to 50  \nbasis points. However the path to easing was anything but smooth, as growth and other economic data         \ngenerally remained strong, and as such the speed and magnitude of policy easing was pared back for many     \ncentral banks, particularly in the U.S.. This led to substantial volatility within the international        \ngovernment bond sector as investors contended with uncertainty of the future path of interest rates. All    \nmajor government bond yields ended the year higher than where they started, resulting in negative           \nperformance for global Treasuries. Uncertainty around the incoming U.S. President\u2019s policies regarding      \ntariffs and their potential impacts on the international backdrop have forced investors to exercise caution \nin this sector.                                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \nFund Performance The Fund's benchmarks are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market            \nperformance.

Organization SPDR Series Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d), a Massachusetts business trust, registered under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d), is an open-end management investment company. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, the Trust consists of eighty-five (85) series, each of which represents a separate series\nof beneficial interest in the Trust. The Declaration of Trust permits the Board of Trustees of the Trust\n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) to authorize the issuance of an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest at $0.01 par\nvalue. The financial statements herein relate to the following series (each a \u201cFund\u201d, and collectively, the\n\u201cFunds\u201d):\n                                                    \n  SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF    \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF   \n  SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF    \n  SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury  \n  Bond ETF                                          \n  SPDR FTSE International Government                \n  Inflation-Protected Bond ETF                      \n                                                    \nEach Fund, except for SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF, is classified as a non-diversified\ninvestment company under the 1940 Act. SPDR Bloomberg International Corporate Bond ETF is classified as a\ndiversified investment company under the 1940 Act. 2. Segment Reporting Each Fund has one reportable\nsegment. Business activities are managed on a consolidated basis and revenues are derived primarily through\neach Fund\u2019s investments in accordance with its investment objective. Each Fund\u2019s chief operating decision\nmaker (\u201cCODM\u201d) is the President of the Trust. The CODM assesses performance based on a Fund\u2019s Total Return\nas reported in the Financial Highlights, and the same accounting policies are applied as described in the\nsummary of significant accounting policies. Each Fund\u2019s Total Return is utilized by the CODM to compare\nresults, including the impact of a Fund\u2019s costs, to a Fund\u2019s competitors and to a Fund\u2019s benchmark index. 3.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies The following is a summary of significant accounting policies\nfollowed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements: The preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Each Fund is an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting guidance applicable to investment companies.\nSecurity Valuation Each Fund's investments are valued at fair value each day that the New York Stock\nExchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) is open and, for financial reporting purposes, as of the report date should the reporting\nperiod end on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair value is generally defined as the price a fund would\nreceive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. By its nature, a fair value price is a good faith estimate of the\nvaluation in a current sale and may not reflect an actual market price. The investments of each Fund are\nvalued pursuant to the policy and procedures developed by the Oversight Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) and\napproved by the Board. The Committee provides oversight of the valuation of investments for the Funds. The\nBoard has responsibility for overseeing the determination of the fair value of investments. Valuation\ntechniques used to value each Fund\u2019s investments by major category are as follows: \u2022 Investments in\nregistered investment companies (including money market funds) or other unitized pooled investment vehicles\nthat are not traded on an exchange are valued at that day\u2019s published net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share or\nunit. \u2022 Government and municipal fixed income securities are generally valued using quotations from\nindependent pricing services or brokers. Certain government inflation-indexed securities may require a\ncalculated fair valuation as the cumulative inflation is contained within the price provided by the pricing\nservice or broker.

Foreign\ncurrencies as well as investment securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign\ncurrency are translated to U.S. dollars using exchange rates at period end. Purchases and sales of\nsecurities, income receipts and expense payments denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S.\ndollars at the prevailing exchange rate on the respective dates of the transactions. The effects of exchange\nrate fluctuations on investments are included with the net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment\nsecurities. Other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain (loss) are\ndisclosed separately. Foreign Taxes The Funds may be subject to foreign taxes (a portion of which may be\nreclaimable) on income, stock dividends, realized and unrealized capital gains on investments or certain\nforeign currency transactions. Foreign taxes are recorded in accordance with SSGA FM understanding of the\napplicable foreign tax regulations and rates that exist in the foreign jurisdictions in which the Funds\ninvest. These foreign taxes, if any, are paid by the Funds and are reflected in the Statements of\nOperations, if applicable. Foreign taxes payable or deferred as of December 31, 2024, if any, are disclosed\nin the Funds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Distributions Distributions from net investment income,\nif any, are declared and paid monthly. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed annually.\nDividends may be declared and paid more frequently or at any other times to improve Index tracking or to\ncomply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, (the \u201cInternal Revenue\nCode\u201d) as amended. The amount and character of income and capital gains to be distributed are determined in\naccordance with applicable tax regulations which may differ from net investment income and realized gains\nrecognized for U.S. GAAP purposes. 4. Derivative Financial Instruments Forward Foreign Currency Exchange\nContracts Certain Funds may engage in forward foreign currency contracts to acquire exposure to foreign\ncurrencies or to hedge the Fund\u2019s investments against currency fluctuations. A forward foreign currency\nexchange contract is a commitment to purchase or sell a foreign currency at the settlement date at a\nnegotiated rate. Non-deliverable forward foreign currency exchange contracts are settled with the\ncounterparty in cash without the delivery of foreign currency. The contract is marked-to-market daily and\nthe change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or loss. When the contract is\nclosed, a Fund recognizes a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract\nat the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Certain risks may arise upon entering\ninto forward foreign currency exchange contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the\nterms of their contracts and are generally limited to the amount of unrealized gains on appreciated\ncontracts, if any. Additionally, when utilizing forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge, the\nFunds give up the opportunity to profit from favorable exchange rate movements during the term of the\ncontract. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF entered\ninto forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage currency exposure.

Income Tax Information The Funds have qualified and intend to continue to qualify as regulated investment\ncompanies under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. Each Fund will not be subject to federal income\ntaxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net realized capital gains, for each\nfiscal year. Therefore, no provision for federal income tax is required. The Funds file federal and various\nstate and local tax returns as required. No income tax returns are currently under examination. Generally,\nthe federal returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years\nfrom date of filing, while the state returns may remain open for an additional year depending upon\njurisdiction. SSGA FM has analyzed each Fund's tax positions taken on tax returns for all open years and\ndoes not believe there are any uncertain tax positions that would require recognition of a tax liability.\nDistributions to shareholders are recorded on ex-dividend date. Income dividends and gain distributions are\ndetermined in accordance with income tax rules and regulations, which may differ from generally accepted\naccounting principles. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements have been adjusted for permanent\nbook-tax differences. These adjustments have no impact on NAV or results of operations. Temporary book-tax\ndifferences will reverse in the future. These book-tax differences are primarily due to differing treatments\nfor character of distributions, in-kind transactions, foreign currencies, premium amortization, net\noperating losses, wash sale loss deferrals, TIPS adjustments, forward contracts and distributions in excess\nof current earnings. The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2024, was as\nfollows:\n

Securities Lending Each Fund may lend securities to qualified broker-dealers or institutional investors.\nThe loans are secured at all times by cash, cash equivalents or U.S. government securities in an amount at\nleast equal to the market value of the securities loaned, plus accrued interest and dividends, determined on\na daily basis and adjusted accordingly. The value of the collateral with respect to a loaned security may be\ntemporarily more or less than the value of a security due to market fluctuations of securities values. With\nrespect to each loan, if on any U.S. business day the aggregate market value of securities collateral plus\ncash collateral is less than the aggregate market value of the securities which are subject to the loan, the\nborrower will be notified to provide additional collateral on the next business day. The Funds will regain\nrecord ownership of loaned securities to exercise certain beneficial rights; however, the Funds may bear the\nrisk of delay in recovery of, or even loss of rights in the securities loaned should the borrower fail\nfinancially. In addition, a Fund will bear the risk of loss of any cash collateral that it may invest. Each\nFund receives compensation for lending its securities from interest or dividends earned on the cash, cash\nequivalents or U.S. government securities held as collateral, net of fee rebates paid to the borrower and\nnet of fees paid to State Street as the lending agent. Additionally, a Fund will receive a fee from the\nborrower for non-cash collateral equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. The\nmarket value of securities on loan as of December 31, 2024, and the value of the invested cash collateral\nare disclosed in the Funds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Non-cash collateral is not disclosed in\nthe Funds' Statements of Assets and Liabilities as it is held by the lending agent on behalf of the Funds\nand the Funds do not have the ability to re-hypothecate those securities. Securities lending income, as\ndisclosed in the Funds' Statements of Operations, represents the income earned from the non-cash collateral\nand the investment of cash collateral, net of fee rebates paid to the borrower and net of fees paid to State\nStreet as lending agent. The following is a summary of each Fund's securities lending agreements and related\ncash and non-cash collateral received as of December 31, 2024:\n

Line of Credit The Funds and other affiliated funds (each, a \u201cParticipant\u201d and collectively, the\n\u201cParticipants\u201d) have access to $194.29 million of a $1.36 billion ($180 million of $1.26 billion prior to\nNovember 1, 2024 and $180 million of $960 million prior to October 3, 2024) revolving credit facility,\nprovided by a syndication of banks under which the Participants may borrow to fund shareholder redemptions.\nThis agreement expires in October 2025 unless extended or renewed. The Participants are charged an annual\ncommitment fee which is calculated based on the unused portion of the shared credit line. Commitment fees\nare allocated among each of the Participants based on relative net assets. Commitment fees are ordinary fund\noperating expenses paid by the Adviser. A Participant incurs and pays the interest expense related to its\nborrowing. Interest is calculated at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1.00% plus the greater of the New\nYork Fed Bank Rate. The Funds had no outstanding loans as of December 31, 2024. 12. Risks Concentration Risk\nAs a result of the Funds\u2019 ability to invest a large percentage of their assets in obligations of issuers\nwithin the same country, state, region, currency or economic sector, an adverse economic, business or\npolitical development may affect the value of the Funds\u2019 investments more than if the Funds were more\nbroadly diversified. Foreign and Emerging Markets Risk Investing in foreign markets involves risks and\nconsiderations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. Foreign securities may be subject to risk\nof loss because of government regulation, economic, political and social instability in the countries in\nwhich the Funds' invest. Foreign markets may be less liquid than investments in the U.S. and may be subject\nto the risks of currency fluctuations. To the extent that a Fund invests in securities of issuers located in\nemerging markets, these risks may be even more pronounced. Credit Risk A Fund may be exposed to credit risk\nin the event that an issuer or guarantor fails to perform or that an institution or entity with which the\nFund has unsettled or open transactions defaults. Market Risk Each Fund's investments are subject to changes\nin general economic conditions, general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in\nsecurities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially\ndue to various factors including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest\nrates, changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers, and general market liquidity. The\nFunds are subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect\nglobal economies and markets.

The scope and scale of sanctions in place at a particular time may be        \nexpanded or otherwise modified in a way that have negative effects on a Fund. Sanctions, or the threat of   \nnew or modified sanctions, could impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive, deliver or       \notherwise transact in certain affected securities or other investment instruments. Sanctions could also     \nresult in Russia taking counter measures or other actions in response, which may further impair the value   \nand liquidity of Russian securities. These sanctions, and the resulting disruption of the Russian economy,  \nmay cause volatility in other regional and global markets and may negatively impact the performance of      \nvarious sectors and industries, as well as companies in other countries, which could have a negative effect \non the performance of a Fund, even if a Fund does not have direct exposure to securities of Russian issuers.\nAs a collective result of the imposition of sanctions, Russian government countermeasures and the impact    \nthat they have had on the trading markets for Russian securities, certain Funds have used, and may in the   \nfuture use, fair valuation procedures approved by the Fund\u2019s Board to value certain Russian securities,     \nwhich could result in such securities being deemed to have a zero value.                                    \n                                                                                                            \n  13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsequent Events                                                                                  \n                                                                                                            \nManagement has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Funds through the date the financial    \nstatements were issued and has determined that there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment or      \ndisclosure in the financial statements.                                                                     \n                                                     72                                                     \nTable of Contents                                                                                           \n                                                                                                            \n  SPDR SERIES TRUST                                                                                         \n                                                                                                            \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                                                     \n                                                                                                            \nTo the Shareholders of SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg International         \nCorporate Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International \nTreasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International Government Inflation-Protected Bond ETF and the Board of      \nTrustees of SPDR \u00ae Series Trust                                                                             \n                                                                                                            \n   Opinion on the Financial Statements                                                                      \n                                                                                                            \nWe have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of\u00a0SPDR Bloomberg Emerging Markets    \nLocal Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg\u00a0 International Corporate Bond ETF, SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond\nETF, SPDR Bloomberg Short Term International Treasury Bond ETF and SPDR FTSE International Government       \nInflation-Protected Bond (collectively referred to as the \u201cFunds\u201d) (five of the series constituting SPDR \u00ae  \nSeries Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d)), including the schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2024, and the       \nrelated statements of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each  \nof the two years in the period then ended, the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period\nthen ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d).

The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged\nto perform, an audit of the Trust\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are \nrequired to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.        \nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.                                                                    \n                                                                                                            \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial     \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such      \nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the       \nfinancial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2024, by  \ncorrespondence with the custodian, brokers and others; when replies were not received from brokers and      \nothers, we performed other auditing procedures.
