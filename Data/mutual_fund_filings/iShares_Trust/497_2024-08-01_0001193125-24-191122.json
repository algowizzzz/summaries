This Example is intended\nto help you compare the cost of\nowning shares of the Fund with\nthe cost of investing in other\nfunds. The Example assumes that\nyou invest $10,000 in the Fund\nfor the time periods indicated\nand then sell all of your shares\nat the end of those periods. The\nExample also assumes that your\ninvestment has a 5% return each\nyear and that the Fund\u2019s\noperating expenses remain the\nsame. Although your actual costs\nmay be higher or lower, based on\nthese assumptions, your costs\nwould be:\n                                      \n  1 Year  3 Years  5 Years  10 Years  \n  $42        $132     $230      $518  \n                                      \nS-2\n\nPortfolio Turnover. The Fund may\npay transaction costs, such as\ncommissions, when it buys and\nsells securities (or \u201c turns over\n\u201d its portfolio). A higher\nportfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs\nand may result in higher taxes\nwhen Fund shares are held in a\ntaxable account. These costs,\nwhich are not reflected in the\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses or\nin the Example, affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance. During the most\nrecent fiscal year, the Fund's\nportfolio turnover rate was 6% of\nthe average value of its\nportfolio. Principal Investment\nStrategies The Fund seeks to\ntrack the investment results of\nthe S&P Global 1200 Utilities\n(Sector) Capped Index TM (the \u201c\nUnderlying Index \u201d ), which\nmeasures the performance of\ncompanies that S&P Dow Jones\nIndices LLC (the \u201c Index Provider\n\u201d or \u201c SPDJI \u201d ), a subsidiary of\nS&P Global, Inc., deems to be\npart of the utilities sector of\nthe economy. The Underlying Index\nis a subset of the S&P Global\n1200, which is designed to\nmeasure the performance of large-\ncapitalization stocks from major\nglobal markets, as determined by\nSPDJI. The Underlying Index uses\na capping methodology to limit\nthe weight of the securities of\nany single issuer (as determined\nby SPDJI) to a maximum of 10% of\nthe Underlying Index.\nAdditionally, the capping\nmethodology limits the sum of the\nweights of the securities of all\nissuers that individually\nconstitute more than 5% of the\nweight of the Underlying Index to\na maximum of 25% of the weight of\nthe Underlying Index in the\naggregate. In order to implement\nthis capping methodology, the\nUnderlying Index constrains at\nquarterly rebalance: (i) the\nweight of any single issuer to a\nmaximum of 10%, and (ii) the\naggregate weight of all issuers\nthat individually exceed 4.5% of\nthe index weight to a maximum of\n22.5%. Between scheduled\nquarterly index reviews, the\nUnderlying Index is rebalanced at\nthe end of any day on which all\nissuers that individually\nconstitute more than 5% of the\nweight of the Underlying Index\nconstitute more than 25% of the\nweight of the Underlying Index in\nthe aggregate. In implementing\nthis capping methodology, SPDJI\nconsiders two or more companies\nas belonging to the same issuer\nwhere more than 20% of all voting\nshares in a subsidiary are\ncontrolled by the same issuer\ncontrol group. As of March 31,\n2024, a significant portion of\nthe Underlying Index is\nrepresented by securities of\ncompanies in the utilities\nindustry or sector. The\ncomponents of the Underlying\nIndex are likely to change over\ntime. As of March 31, 2024, the\nUnderlying Index was composed of\nsecurities of companies in the\nfollowing countries or regions:\nAustralia, Austria, Brazil,\nCanada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark,\nFinland, France, Germany, Italy,\nJapan, Portugal, Spain, the\nUnited Kingdom (the \u201c U.K. \u201d )\nand the U.S. BFA uses an indexing\napproach to try to achieve the\nFund\u2019s investment objective.\nUnlike many investment companies,\nthe Fund does not try to \u201c beat \u201d\nthe index it tracks and does not\nseek temporary defensive\npositions when markets decline or\nappear overvalued. Indexing may\neliminate the chance that the\nFund will substantially\noutperform the Underlying Index\nbut also may S-3 reduce some of\nthe risks of active management,\nsuch as poor security selection.\nIndexing seeks to achieve lower\ncosts and better after-tax\nperformance by aiming to keep\nportfolio turnover low in\ncomparison to actively managed\ninvestment companies. BFA uses a\nrepresentative sampling indexing\nstrategy to manage the Fund. \u201c\nRepresentative sampling \u201d is an\nindexing strategy that involves\ninvesting in a representative\nsample of securities that\ncollectively has an investment\nprofile similar to that of an\napplicable underlying index. The\nsecurities selected are expected\nto have, in the aggregate,\ninvestment characteristics (based\non factors such as market\ncapitalization and industry\nweightings), fundamental\ncharacteristics (such as return\nvariability and yield) and\nliquidity measures similar to\nthose of an applicable underlying\nindex. The Fund may or may not\nhold all of the securities in the\nUnderlying Index. The Fund\ngenerally will invest at least\n80% of its assets in the\ncomponent securities of its\nUnderlying Index and in\ninvestments that have economic\ncharacteristics that are\nsubstantially identical to the\ncomponent securities of its\nUnderlying Index ( i.e .,\ndepositary receipts representing\nsecurities of the Underlying\nIndex) and may invest up to 20%\nof its assets in certain futures,\noptions and swap contracts, cash\nand cash equivalents, including\nshares of money market funds\nadvised by BFA or its affiliates,\nas well as in securities not\nincluded in the Underlying Index,\nbut which BFA believes will help\nthe Fund track the Underlying\nIndex. Cash and cash equivalent\ninvestments associated with a\nderivative position will be\ntreated as part of that position\nfor the purposes of calculating\nthe percentage of investments\nincluded in the Underlying Index.\nThe Fund seeks to track the\ninvestment results of the\nUnderlying Index before fees and\nexpenses of the Fund. The Fund\nmay lend securities representing\nup to one-third of the value of\nthe Fund's total assets\n(including the value of any\ncollateral received). The\nUnderlying Index is a product of\nSPDJI, which is independent of\nthe Fund and BFA. The Index\nProvider determines the\ncomposition and relative\nweightings of the securities in\nthe Underlying Index and\npublishes information regarding\nthe market value of the\nUnderlying Index. Industry\nConcentration Policy. The Fund\nwill concentrate its investments\n( i.e. , hold 25% or more of its\ntotal assets) in a particular\nindustry or group of industries\nto approximately the same extent\nthat the Underlying Index is\nconcentrated. For purposes of\nthis limitation, securities of\nthe U.S. government (including\nits agencies and\ninstrumentalities) and repurchase\nagreements collateralized by U.S.\ngovernment securities are not\nconsidered to be issued by\nmembers of any industry. Summary\nof Principal Risks As with any\ninvestment, you could lose all or\npart of your investment in the\nFund, and the Fund's performance\ncould trail that of other\ninvestments.The Fund is subject\nto certain risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund's net asset value per share\n( \u201c NAV \u201d ), trading price,\nyield, total return and ability\nto meet its investment objective.\nCertain key risks are prioritized\nbelow (with others following in\nalphabetical order), but the\nrelative significance of S-4 any\nrisk is difficult to predict and\nmay change over time. You should\nreview each risk factor\ncarefully. Utilities Sector Risk.\nThe utilities sector is subject\nto significant government\nregulation and oversight.\nDeregulation, however, may\nsubject utility companies to\ngreater competition and may\nreduce their profitability.\nCompanies in the utilities sector\nmay be adversely affected due to\nincreases in fuel and operating\ncosts, rising costs of financing\ncapital construction and the cost\nof complying with regulations,\namong other factors. Equity\nSecurities Risk . Equity\nsecurities are subject to changes\nin value, and their values may be\nmore volatile than those of other\nasset classes. The value of a\nsecurity may decline for a number\nof reasons that may directly\nrelate to the issuer as well as\ndue to general industry or market\nconditions. Common stock is\nsubordinated to preferred\nsecurities and debt in a\ncompany\u2019s capital structure.\nCommon stock has the lowest\npriority, and the greatest risk,\nwith respect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments in the event\nof an issuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Market\nRisk . The Fund could lose money\nover short periods due to short-\nterm market movements and over\nlonger periods during more\nprolonged market downturns.\nLocal, regional or global events\nsuch as war, acts of terrorism,\npandemics or other public health\nissues, recessions, the prospect\nor occurrence of a sovereign\ndefault or other financial\ncrisis, or other events could\nhave a significant impact on the\nFund and its investments and\ncould result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Index-Related Risk.\nThe Index Provider may rely on\nvarious sources of information to\nassess the criteria of components\nof the Underlying Index,\nincluding information that may be\nbased on assumptions and\nestimates. Neither the Fund nor\nBFA can offer assurances that the\nIndex Provider\u2019s methodology or\nsources of information will\nprovide an accurate assessment of\nincluded components. Errors in\nindex data, index computations or\nthe construction of the\nUnderlying Index in accordance\nwith its methodology may occur,\nand the Index Provider may not\nidentify or correct them promptly\nor at all, which may have an\nadverse impact on the Fund and\nits shareholders. Unusual market\nconditions or other unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as natural\ndisasters, political unrest or\nwar) may impact the Index\nProvider or a third-party data\nprovider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. Asset Class Risk.\nThe securities and other assets\nin the Underlying Index or in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may underperform\nin comparison to financial\nmarkets generally, a particular\nfinancial market, another index,\nor other asset classes.\nAuthorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. An \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d is a\nmember or participant of a\nclearing agency registered with\nthe SEC, which has a written\nagreement with the Fund or one of\nits service providers that allows\nthe Authorized Participant to\nplace orders for the purchase and\nredemption of creation units ( \u201c\nCreation Units \u201d ). Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. S-5 There are a limited\nnumber of institutions that may\nact as Authorized Participants\nfor the Fund, including on an\nagency basis on behalf of other\nmarket participants. No\nAuthorized Participant is\nobligated to engage in creation\nor redemption transactions. To\nthe extent that Authorized\nParticipants exit the business or\ndo not place creation or\nredemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Concentration Risk.\nThe Fund may be susceptible to an\nincreased risk of loss, including\nlosses due to adverse events that\naffect the Fund\u2019s investments\nmore than the market as a whole,\nto the extent that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities or other assets of\none or more issuers, countries or\nother geographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. Currency Risk .\nBecause the Fund\u2019s NAV is\ndetermined in U.S. dollars, the\nNAV could decline if the currency\nof the non-U.S. market in which\nthe Fund invests depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar or if\nthere are delays or limits on the\nrepatriation of foreign currency.\nCurrency exchange rates can be\nvery volatile and can change\nquickly and unpredictably. As a\nresult, the Fund\u2019s NAV may change\nquickly and without warning. In\naddition, the Fund may incur\ncosts in connection with\nconversions between U.S. dollars\nand foreign currencies.\nCybersecurity Risk . Failures or\nbreaches of the electronic\nsystems of the Fund, its adviser,\ndistributor, Index Provider,\nother service providers,\ncounterparties, or issuers of\nassets in which the Fund invests\nmay cause disruptions that\nnegatively impact the Fund and\nits shareholders. While the Fund\nhas established business\ncontinuity plans and risk\nmanagement systems seeking to\naddress system breaches or\nfailures, there are inherent\nlimitations in such plans and\nsystems. The Fund cannot control\nthe cybersecurity plans and\nsystems of its service providers,\ncounterparties, and other third\nparties whose activities affect\nthe Fund. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk . Investing in dividend-\npaying stocks involves the risk\nthat such stocks may fall out of\nfavor with investors and\nunderperform other types of\nstocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to\npay or continue paying dividends\non such stocks. It is possible\nthat issuers of the stocks held\nby the Fund will not declare\ndividends in the future or will\nreduce or eliminate the payment\nof dividends (including reducing\nor eliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the\npayment of dividends), which may\nadversely affect the Fund.\nGeographic Risk . A natural\ndisaster could occur in a\ngeographic region in which the\nFund invests, which could\nadversely affect the economy or\nthe business operations of\ncompanies in the specific\ngeographic region, causing an\nadverse impact on the Fund's\ninvestments in, or which are\nexposed to, the affected region.\nIssuer Risk . The performance of\nthe Fund depends on the\nperformance of individual\nsecurities or other assets to\nwhich the Fund has exposure. The\nvalue of securities or other\nassets may decline, or perform\ndifferently from the S-6 market\nas a whole, due to changes in the\nfinancial condition or credit\nrating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk.\nLarge-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-\ncapitalization companies to adapt\nto changing market conditions and\ncompetitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be\nmore mature and subject to more\nlimited growth potential compared\nwith smaller-capitalization\ncompanies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies\ncould trail the overall\nperformance of the broader\nsecurities markets. Large\nShareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of the Fund,\nincluding an Authorized\nParticipant, a third-party\ninvestor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser,\na market maker, or another\nentity, may from time to time own\nor manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares, or may hold their\ninvestment in the Fund for a\nlimited period of time. There can\nbe no assurance that any large\nshareholder or large group of\nshareholders would not redeem\ntheir investment. Redemptions of\na large number of Fund shares\ncould require the Fund to dispose\nof assets to meet the redemption\nrequests, which can accelerate\nthe realization of taxable income\nand/or capital gains and cause\nthe Fund to make taxable\ndistributions to its shareholders\nearlier than the Fund otherwise\nwould have. In addition, under\ncertain circumstances, non-\nredeeming shareholders may be\ntreated as receiving a\ndisproportionately large taxable\ndistribution during or with\nrespect to such year. In some\ncircumstances, the Fund may hold\na relatively large proportion of\nits assets in cash in\nanticipation of large\nredemptions, diluting its\ninvestment returns. These large\nredemptions may also force the\nFund to sell portfolio securities\nor other assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV,\nincrease the Fund\u2019s brokerage\ncosts and/or have a material\neffect on the market price of\nFund shares. Management Risk .\nThe Fund is not actively managed,\nand BFA generally does not\nattempt to take defensive\npositions under any market\nconditions, including declining\nmarkets. As the Fund will not\nfully replicate the Underlying\nIndex and may hold securities or\nother assets not included in the\nUnderlying Index, it is subject\nto the risk that the investment\nstrategy of BFA may not produce\nthe intended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of the Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nTrading Risk . The Fund faces\nnumerous market trading risks,\nincluding the potential lack of\nan active market for Fund shares\n(including through a trading\nhalt), losses from trading in\nsecondary markets, periods of\nhigh volatility, and disruptions\nin the process of creating and\nredeeming Fund shares. Any of\nthese factors, among others, may\nlead to the Fund\u2019s shares trading\nin the secondary market at a\npremium or discount to NAV or to\nthe intraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy\nFund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a premium to\nNAV or sell Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\ndiscount to NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the\nunderlying value of the Fund\nshares. S-7 National Closed\nMarket Trading Risk. To the\nextent that securities or other\nassets held by the Fund trade on\nforeign exchanges or in foreign\nmarkets that may be closed when\nthe securities exchange on which\nthe Fund\u2019s shares trade is open,\nthere are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current\nprice and its last quoted price (\ni.e ., the quote from the closed\nforeign market to the Fund). The\nimpact of a closed foreign market\non the Fund is likely to be\ngreater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a\nforeign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV that may be greater\nthan those experienced by other\nfunds. Non-U.S. Securities Risk .\nInvestments in the securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers are subject to\nthe risks associated with\ninvesting in those non-U.S.\nmarkets, such as heightened risks\nof inflation or nationalization.\nThe Fund may lose money due to\npolitical, economic and\ngeographic events affecting\nissuers of non-U.S. securities or\nnon-U.S. markets. In addition,\nnon-U.S. securities markets may\ntrade a small number of\nsecurities and may be unable to\nrespond effectively to changes in\ntrading volume, potentially\nmaking prompt liquidation of\nholdings difficult or impossible\nat times. The Fund is\nspecifically exposed to European\nEconomic Risk. Operational Risk .\nThe Fund is exposed to\noperational risks arising from a\nnumber of factors, including, but\nnot limited to, human error,\nprocessing and communication\nerrors, errors of the Fund\u2019s\nservice providers, counterparties\nor other third parties, failed or\ninadequate processes and\ntechnology or systems failures.\nThe Fund and BFA seek to reduce\nthese operational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries\n. The Fund\u2019s investment in\ndeveloped country issuers will\nsubject the Fund to legal,\nregulatory, political, currency,\nsecurity, economic and other\nrisks associated with developed\ncountries. Developed countries\ntend to represent a significant\nportion of the global economy and\nhave generally experienced slower\neconomic growth than some less\ndeveloped countries. Certain\ndeveloped countries have\nexperienced security concerns,\nsuch as war, terrorism and\nstrained international relations.\nIncidents involving a country\u2019s\nor region\u2019s security may cause\nuncertainty in its markets and\nmay adversely affect its economy\nand the Fund\u2019s investments. In\naddition, developed countries may\nbe adversely impacted by changes\nto the economic conditions of\ncertain key trading partners,\nregulatory burdens, debt burdens\nand the price or availability of\ncertain commodities. Risk of\nInvesting in the U.S . Investing\nin U.S. issuers subjects the Fund\nto legal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, and economic\nrisks that are specific to the\nU.S. Certain changes in the U.S.,\nsuch as a weakening of the U.S.\neconomy or a decline in its\nfinancial markets, may have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nS-8 the securities in a timely\nmanner or at all. The Fund could\nalso lose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse\ntax consequences for the Fund.\nSecurity Risk . Some countries\nand regions in which the Fund\ninvests have experienced security\nconcerns, such as war, terrorism\nand strained international\nrelations. Incidents involving a\ncountry's or region's security\nmay cause uncertainty in its\nmarkets and may adversely affect\nits economy and the Fund's\ninvestments. Tracking Error Risk\n. The Fund may be subject to \u201c\ntracking error, \u201d which is the\ndivergence of the Fund\u2019s\nperformance from that of the\nUnderlying Index. Tracking error\nmay occur because of differences\nbetween the securities and other\ninstruments held in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and those included in\nthe Underlying Index, pricing\ndifferences (including, as\napplicable, differences between a\nsecurity\u2019s price at the local\nmarket close and the Fund's\nvaluation of a security at the\ntime of calculation of the Fund's\nNAV), transaction costs incurred\nby the Fund, the Fund\u2019s holding\nof uninvested cash, differences\nin timing of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to the Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to\nmaintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders, acceptance of\ncustom baskets, changes to the\nUnderlying Index or the costs to\nthe Fund of complying with\nvarious new or existing\nregulatory requirements, among\nother reasons. This risk may be\nheightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while the Underlying\nIndex does not. Tracking error\nmay occur due to differences\nbetween the methodologies used in\ncalculating the value of the\nUnderlying Index and determining\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV. Valuation Risk .\nThe price that the Fund could\nreceive upon the sale (or other\ndisposition) of a security or\nother asset may differ from the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the security\nor other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that\ntrade in low volume or volatile\nmarkets or that are valued using\na fair value methodology. The\nprice received by the Fund also\nmay differ from the value used by\nthe Underlying Index. In\naddition, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when\ninvestors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares.\nAuthorized Participants that\ncreate or redeem Fund shares on\ndays when the Fund is holding\nfair-valued securities or other\nassets may receive fewer or more\nshares, or lower or higher\nredemption proceeds, than they\nwould have received had the\nsecurities or other assets not\nbeen fair valued or been valued\nusing a different methodology.\nThe ability to value investments\nmay be impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party\nservice providers. S-9\nPerformance Information The bar\nchart and table that follow show\nhow the Fund has performed on a\ncalendar year basis and provide\nsome indication of the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund by showing\nhow the Fund\u2019s average annual\nreturns for 1, 5, and 10 years\ncompare with the Underlying\nIndex.Both assume that all\ndividends and distributions have\nbeen reinvested in the Fund.

Fund returns\nafter taxes on distributions and\nsales of Fund shares are\ncalculated assuming that an\ninvestor has sufficient capital\ngains of the same character from\nother investments to offset any\ncapital losses from the sale of\nFund shares. As a result, Fund\nreturns after taxes on\ndistributions and sales of Fund\nshares may exceed Fund returns\nbefore taxes and/or returns after\ntaxes on distributions. 2 Index\nreturns through May 2, 2021\nreflect the performance of the\nS&P Global 1200 Utilities Index.\nIndex returns beginning on May 3,\n2021 reflect the performance of\nthe S&P Global 1200 Utilities\n(Sector) Capped Index, which,\neffective as of May 3, 2021,\nreplaced the S&P Global 1200\nUtilities Index as the Underlying\nIndex of the Fund.\n\nS-11\n\nManagement Investment Adviser.\nBlackRock Fund Advisors.\nPortfolio Managers. Jennifer\nHsui, Greg Savage and Paul\nWhitehead (the \u201c Portfolio\nManagers \u201d ) are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. Each\nPortfolio Manager supervises a\nportfolio management team. Ms.\nHsui, Mr. Savage and Mr.\nWhitehead have been Portfolio\nManagers of the Fund since 2012,\n2008 and 2022, respectively.\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares\nThe Fund is an ETF. Individual\nshares of the Fund may only be\nbought and sold in the secondary\nmarket through a broker-dealer.\nBecause ETF shares trade at\nmarket prices rather than at NAV,\nshares may trade at a price\ngreater than NAV (a premium) or\nless than NAV (a discount). An\ninvestor may incur costs\nattributable to the difference\nbetween the highest price a buyer\nis willing to pay to purchase\nshares of the Fund (bid) and the\nlowest price a seller is willing\nto accept for shares of the Fund\n(ask) when buying or selling\nshares in the secondary market\n(the \u201c bid-ask spread \u201d ). Tax\nInformation The Fund intends to\nmake distributions that may be\ntaxable to you as ordinary income\nor capital gains, unless you are\ninvesting through a tax-deferred\narrangement such as a 401(k) plan\nor an IRA, in which case, your\ndistributions generally will be\ntaxed when withdrawn. Payments to\nBroker-Dealers and Other\nFinancial Intermediaries If you\npurchase shares of the Fund\nthrough a broker-dealer or other\nfinancial intermediary (such as a\nbank), BFA or other related\ncompanies may pay the\nintermediary for marketing\nactivities and presentations,\neducational training programs,\nconferences, the development of\ntechnology platforms and\nreporting systems or other\nservices related to the sale or\npromotion of the Fund. These\npayments may create a conflict of\ninterest by influencing the\nbroker-dealer or other\nintermediary and your salesperson\nto recommend the Fund over\nanother investment. Ask your\nsalesperson or visit your\nfinancial intermediary\u2019s website\nfor more information. S-12 [THIS\nPAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\nMore Information About the Fund\nThis Prospectus contains\nimportant information about\ninvesting in the Fund. Please\nread this Prospectus carefully\nbefore you make any investment\ndecisions. Additional information\nregarding the Fund is available\nat www.iShares.com. BFA is the\ninvestment adviser to the Fund.\nShares of the Fund are listed for\ntrading on NYSE Arca, Inc. ( \u201c\nNYSE Arca \u201d ). The market price\nfor a share of the Fund may be\ndifferent from the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. ETFs are funds that\ntrade like other publicly traded\nsecurities. The Fund is designed\nto track an index. Similar to\nshares of an index mutual fund,\neach share of the Fund represents\nan ownership interest in an\nunderlying portfolio of\nsecurities and other instruments\nintended to track a market index.\nUnlike shares of a mutual fund,\nwhich can be bought and redeemed\nfrom the issuing fund by all\nshareholders at a price based on\nNAV, shares of the Fund may be\npurchased or redeemed directly\nfrom the Fund at NAV solely by\nAuthorized Participants and only\nin aggregations of a specified\nnumber of shares ( \u201c Creation\nUnits \u201d ). Also unlike shares of\na mutual fund, shares of the Fund\nare listed on a national\nsecurities exchange and trade in\nthe secondary market at market\nprices that change throughout the\nday. The Fund invests in a\nparticular segment of the\nsecurities markets and seeks to\ntrack the performance of a\nsecurities index that is not\nrepresentative of the market as a\nwhole. The Fund is designed to be\nused as part of broader asset\nallocation strategies.\nAccordingly, an investment in the\nFund should not constitute a\ncomplete investment program. An\nindex is a financial calculation,\nbased on a grouping of financial\ninstruments, and is not an\ninvestment product, while the\nFund is an actual investment\nportfolio. The performance of the\nFund and the Underlying Index may\nvary for a number of reasons,\nincluding transaction costs,\nnon-U.S. currency valuations,\nasset valuations, corporate\nactions (such as mergers and\nspin-offs), timing variances and\ndifferences between the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio and the Underlying\nIndex resulting from the Fund's\nuse of representative sampling or\nfrom legal restrictions (such as\ndiversification requirements)\nthat apply to the Fund but not to\nthe Underlying Index. From time\nto time, the Index Provider may\nmake changes to the methodology\nor other adjustments to the\nUnderlying Index. Unless\notherwise determined by BFA, any\nsuch change or adjustment will be\nreflected in the calculation of\nthe Underlying Index performance\non a going-forward basis after\nthe effective date of such change\nor adjustment. Therefore, the\nUnderlying Index performance\nshown for periods prior to the\neffective date of any such change\nor adjustment will generally not\nbe recalculated or restated to\nreflect such change or\nadjustment. Because the Fund uses\na representative sampling\nindexing strategy, it can be\nexpected to have a larger\ntracking error than if it used a\nreplication indexing strategy. \u201c\nReplication \u201d is an indexing\nstrategy in which a fund invests\nin substantially all of the\nsecurities in its underlying\nindex in approximately the same\nproportions as in the underlying\nindex. 1 The Fund may borrow as a\ntemporary measure for\nextraordinary or emergency\npurposes, including to meet\nredemptions or to facilitate the\nsettlement of securities or other\ntransactions. The Fund does not\nintend to borrow money in order\nto leverage its portfolio. An\ninvestment in the Fund is not a\nbank deposit and it is not\ninsured or guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or any other\ngovernment agency, BFA or any of\nits affiliates. The Fund's\ninvestment objective and the\nUnderlying Index may be changed\nwithout shareholder approval. A\nFurther Discussion of Principal\nRisks The Fund is subject to\nvarious risks, including the\nprincipal risks noted below, any\nof which may adversely affect the\nFund\u2019s NAV, trading price, yield,\ntotal return and ability to meet\nits investment objective. You\ncould lose all or part of your\ninvestment in the Fund, and the\nFund could underperform other\ninvestments. The order of the\nbelow risk factors does not\nindicate the significance of any\nparticular risk factor. The Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Asset\nClass Risk. The securities and\nother assets in the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio or its Underlying Index\nmay underperform in comparison to\nother indexes that track, or\nassets that represent, other\ncountries or geographic units,\nindustries, markets, market\nsegments, or asset classes.\nVarious types of securities,\nother assets and indexes may\nexperience cycles of\noutperformance and\nunderperformance in comparison to\nfinancial markets generally. This\ndivergence may be due to a number\nof factors including, among other\nthings, inflation, interest\nrates, productivity, global\ndemand for local products or\nresources, and regulation and\ngovernmental controls. This may\ncause the Fund to underperform\nother investment vehicles that\ninvest in different asset\nclasses. Authorized Participant\nConcentration Risk. Only an\nAuthorized Participant may engage\nin creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. There are a limited number\nof institutions that may act as\nAuthorized Participants for the\nFund, including on an agency\nbasis on behalf of other market\nparticipants. No Authorized\nParticipant is obligated to\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions. To the extent that\nAuthorized Participants exit the\nbusiness or do not place creation\nor redemption orders for the Fund\nand no other Authorized\nParticipant places orders, Fund\nshares are more likely to trade\nat a premium or discount to NAV\nand possibly face trading halts\nor delisting. Authorized\nParticipant concentration risk\nmay be heightened for a Fund that\ninvests in securities issued by\nnon-U.S. issuers or instruments\nwith lower trading volume. Such\nassets often entail greater\nsettlement and operational\ncomplexity and higher capital\ncosts for Authorized\nParticipants, which may limit the\nnumber of Authorized Participants\nthat engage with the Fund.\nConcentration Risk. The Fund may\nbe susceptible to an increased\nrisk of loss, including losses\ndue to adverse events that affect\nthe Fund\u2019s investments more than\nthe market as a whole, to the\nextent that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments are concentrated in\nthe securities or other assets of\none or more issuers, countries or\nother geographic units, markets,\nindustries, project types, or\nasset classes. A Fund with\ninvestment 2 concentration may be\nmore adversely affected by the\nunderperformance of those assets,\nmay experience greater price\nvolatility and may be more\nsusceptible to adverse economic,\nmarket, political or regulatory\nimpacts on those assets compared\nto a fund that does not\nconcentrate its investments.\nCurrency Risk. Because the Fund\u2019s\nNAV is determined on the basis of\nthe U.S. dollar, investors may\nlose money if the currency of a\nnon-U.S. market in which the Fund\ninvests depreciates against the\nU.S. dollar or if there are\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof foreign currency, even if the\nforeign currency value of the\nFund\u2019s holdings in that market\nincreases. Currency exchange\nrates can be very volatile and\ncan change quickly and\nunpredictably. As a result, the\nFund\u2019s NAV may change quickly and\nwithout warning. In addition, the\nFund may incur costs in\nconnection with conversions\nbetween U.S. dollars and foreign\ncurrencies. Cybersecurity Risk.\nThe Fund and entities that\ninteract with the Fund are\nsusceptible to operational,\ninformation security and related\ncybersecurity risks, both\ndirectly and through their\nservice providers. These entities\ninclude, but are not limited to,\nthe Fund\u2019s adviser, distributor,\nother service providers ( e.g .,\nindex and benchmark providers,\naccountants, custodians, transfer\nagents and administrators),\ncounterparties, market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, listing\nexchanges, other financial market\noperators, and governmental\nauthorities. Cybersecurity risks\nare also present for issuers of\nsecurities or other assets in\nwhich the Fund invests, which\ncould result in material adverse\nconsequences for such issuers and\nmay cause the Fund\u2019s investment\nin such issuers to lose value.\nCyber incidents can result from\ndeliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. They\ninclude, but are not limited to,\ngaining unauthorized access to\nsystems, misappropriating assets\nor sensitive information,\ncorrupting or destroying data,\nand causing operational\ndisruption. Geopolitical tensions\nmay increase the scale and\nsophistication of deliberate\nattacks, particularly those from\nnation-states or from entities\nwith nation-state backing.\nCybersecurity incidents may cause\ndisruptions and impact business\noperations and may result in any\nof the following: financial\nlosses, interference with the\nFund\u2019s ability to calculate its\nNAV, disclosure of confidential\ninformation, impediments to\ntrading, submission of erroneous\ntrades or erroneous creation or\nredemption orders, the inability\nof the Fund or its service\nproviders to transact business,\nviolations of applicable privacy\nand other laws, regulatory fines,\npenalties, reputational damage,\nreimbursement or other\ncompensation costs, and other\nlegal and compliance expenses. In\naddition, cyber incidents may\nrender records of Fund assets and\ntransactions, shareholder\nownership of Fund shares, and\nother data integral to the Fund\u2019s\nfunctioning inaccessible,\ninaccurate or incomplete. The\nFund may incur substantial costs\nin order to resolve or prevent\ncyber incidents. The Fund has\nestablished business continuity\nplans in the event of, and risk\nmanagement systems to prevent,\ncyber incidents. However, there\nare inherent limitations in such\nplans and systems, including the\npossibility that certain risks\nhave not been identified, that\nprevention and remediation\nefforts will not be successful or\nthat cyber incidents will go\nundetected. Furthermore, the Fund\ncannot control the cybersecurity\nplans and systems of its service\nproviders, counterparties, and\nother 3 third parties whose\nactivities affect the Fund. The\nFund and its shareholders could\nbe negatively impacted as a\nresult. Dividend-Paying Stock\nRisk. Investing in dividend-\npaying stocks involves the risk\nthat such stocks may fall out of\nfavor with investors and\nunderperform other types of\nstocks or the broader market.\nCompanies that issue dividend-\npaying stocks are not required to\npay or continue paying dividends\non such stocks. It is possible\nthat issuers of dividend-paying\nstocks will not declare dividends\nin the future or will reduce or\neliminate the payment of\ndividends (including reducing or\neliminating anticipated\naccelerations or increases in the\npayment of dividends), which may\nadversely affect a Fund with such\nholdings. In addition, the value\nof dividend-paying stocks can\ndecline when interest rates rise,\nas fixed-income investments\nbecome more attractive to\ninvestors. Equity Securities\nRisk. Equity securities are\nsubject to changes in value due\nto general market or economic\nconditions, perceptions about the\nmarkets in which issuers\nparticipate or a number of\nfactors relating to a specific\nissuer. Investments in equity\nsecurities may be more volatile\nthan investments in other asset\nclasses. Equity securities (both\ncommon and preferred stock) are\nsubordinated to debt securities\nin a company\u2019s capital structure,\nand so equity holders are\ngenerally subject to more risks,\nparticularly in the event of an\nissuer\u2019s bankruptcy. Common stock\nhas the lowest priority and the\ngreatest risks, including with\nrespect to dividends and any\nliquidation payments. European\nEconomic Risk. The Economic and\nMonetary Union (the \u201c eurozone \u201d\n) of the European Union (the \u201c EU\n\u201d ) requires compliance by member\nstates that are members of the\neurozone with restrictions on\ninflation rates, deficits,\ninterest rates and debt levels,\nas well as fiscal and monetary\ncontrols, each of which may\nsignificantly affect every\ncountry in Europe, including\nthose countries that are not\nmembers of the eurozone.\nAdditionally, European countries\noutside of the eurozone may\npresent economic risks that are\nindependent of the indirect\neffects that eurozone policies\nhave on them. In particular, the\nU.K.'s economy may be affected by\nglobal economic, industrial and\nfinancial shifts. Changes in\nimports or exports, changes in\ngovernmental or EU regulations on\ntrade, changes in the exchange\nrate of the euro (the common\ncurrency of eurozone countries),\nthe default or threat of default\nby an EU member state on its\nsovereign debt and/or an economic\nrecession in an EU member state\nmay have a significant adverse\neffect on the economies of other\nEU member states and their\ntrading partners. The European\nfinancial markets have\nhistorically experienced\nvolatility and adverse trends due\nto concerns about economic\ndownturns or government debt\nlevels in several European\ncountries, including, but not\nlimited to, Austria, Belgium,\nCyprus, France, Greece, Ireland,\nItaly, Portugal, Spain and\nUkraine. These events have\naffected and may in the future\nadversely affect the exchange\nrate of the euro and may\nsignificantly affect European\ncountries. Responses to financial\nproblems by European governments,\ncentral banks and others,\nincluding austerity measures and\nreforms, may not produce the\ndesired results, may result in\nsocial unrest, may limit future\ngrowth and economic recovery or\nmay have other unintended\nconsequences. Further defaults or\nrestructurings by governments and\nother entities of their debt\ncould have additional adverse\neffects on economies, 4 financial\nmarkets and asset valuations\naround the world. In addition,\none or more countries may abandon\nthe euro and/or withdraw from the\nEU. The U.K. left the EU ( \u201c\nBrexit \u201d ) on January 31, 2020.\nBrexit could adversely affect\nEuropean or worldwide political,\nregulatory, economic or market\nconditions and could contribute\nto instability in global\npolitical institutions,\nregulatory agencies and financial\nmarkets. The national politics of\ncountries in Europe have been\nunpredictable and subject to\ninfluence by disruptive political\ngroups and ideologies, including,\nfor example, secessionist\nmovements. The governments of\nEuropean countries may be subject\nto change and such countries may\nexperience social and political\nunrest. Unanticipated or sudden\npolitical or social developments\nmay result in sudden and\nsignificant investment losses.\nThe occurrence of terrorist\nincidents throughout Europe or\nwar in the region could also\nimpact financial markets. The\nimpact of these events is not\nclear but could be significant\nand far-reaching and could\nadversely affect the value and\nliquidity of the Fund's\ninvestments. Russian Invasion of\nUkraine . Russia launched a\nlarge-scale invasion of Ukraine\non February 24, 2022. The extent\nand duration of the military\naction, resulting sanctions and\nresulting future market\ndisruptions, including declines\nin its stock markets and the\nvalue of the ruble against the\nU.S. dollar, are impossible to\npredict, but could be\nsignificant. Disruptions caused\nby Russian military action or\nother actions (including\ncyberattacks and espionage) or\nresulting actual and threatened\nresponses to such activity,\nincluding purchasing and\nfinancing restrictions, boycotts\nor changes in consumer or\npurchaser preferences, sanctions,\nimport and export restrictions,\ntariffs or cyberattacks on the\nRussian government, Russian\ncompanies or Russian individuals,\nincluding politicians, may impact\nRussia's economy, Russian issuers\nof securities in which the Fund\ninvests, or the economies of\nEurope as a whole. Actual and\nthreatened responses to Russian\nmilitary action may also impact\nthe markets for certain Russian\ncommodities, such as oil and\nnatural gas, as well as other\nsectors of the Russian economy,\nand are likely to have collateral\nimpacts on such sectors across\nEurope and globally. Geographic\nRisk. Some of the companies in\nwhich the Fund invests are\nlocated in parts of the world\nthat have historically been prone\nto natural disasters, such as\nearthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic\neruptions, droughts, floods,\nhurricanes or tsunamis, and are\neconomically sensitive to\nenvironmental events. Any such\nevent may adversely impact the\neconomies of these geographic\nareas or business operations of\ncompanies in these geographic\nareas, causing an adverse impact\non the value of the Fund. Index-\nRelated Risk. The Fund seeks to\nachieve a return that corresponds\ngenerally to the price and yield\nperformance, before fees and\nexpenses, of its Underlying Index\nas published by the Index\nProvider. There is no assurance\nthat the Index Provider or its\nagents will construct or\ncalculate the Underlying Index\naccurately. While the Index\nProvider describes what the\nUnderlying Index is designed to\nachieve, neither the Index\nProvider nor its agents provide\nany warranty or accept any\nliability regarding the quality,\naccuracy or completeness of the\nUnderlying Index or its related\ndata, and they do not guarantee\nthat the Underlying Index will be\nin line with the Index Provider\u2019s\nmethodology. BFA also does not\nprovide any warranty or guarantee\nagainst the Index Provider\u2019s or\nany agent\u2019s errors. 5 The Index\nProvider may rely on various\nsources of information to assess\nthe criteria of components of the\nUnderlying Index, including\ninformation that may be based on\nassumptions and estimates.\nNeither the Fund nor BFA can\noffer assurances that the Index\nProvider\u2019s methodology or sources\nof information will provide an\naccurate assessment of included\ncomponents. Errors in index data,\nindex computations or the\nconstruction of the Underlying\nIndex in accordance with its\nmethodology may occur, and the\nIndex Provider may not identify\nor correct them promptly or at\nall, particularly for indexes\nthat are less commonly used as\nbenchmarks. In addition, there\nmay be heightened risks\nassociated with the adequacy and\nreliability of information about\nemerging markets constituents, as\nsuch markets may have less\ninformation available or less\nregulatory oversight. Errors\nrelated to the Underlying Index\nmay negatively or positively\nimpact the Fund and its\nshareholders. For example, if the\nUnderlying Index contains\nincorrect constituents, the Fund\nwill have exposure to such\nconstituents and will be\nunderexposed to the Underlying\nIndex\u2019s other constituents.\nShareholders should understand\nthat any gains from the Index\nProvider\u2019s errors will be kept by\nthe Fund and its shareholders and\nany losses or costs from such\nerrors will be borne by the Fund\nand its shareholders. Unusual\nmarket conditions or other\nunforeseen circumstances (such as\nnatural disasters, political\nunrest or war) may impact the\nIndex Provider or a third-party\ndata provider and could cause the\nIndex Provider to postpone a\nscheduled rebalance to the\nUnderlying Index. This could\ncause the Underlying Index to\nvary from its normal or expected\ncomposition. If a scheduled\nrebalance is postponed, index\nconstituents that would otherwise\nbe removed at the rebalance (due\nto, for example, changes in\nmarket capitalization or issuer\ncredit ratings) may remain,\ncausing the performance and\nconstituents of the Underlying\nIndex to vary from those expected\nunder normal conditions. In\naddition, to the extent\ncircumstances evolve between\nperiodic index reviews and\nreconstitutions, the Underlying\nIndex may include constituents\nthat do not align with its\nobjective or selection criteria,\nand the Fund tracking the\nUnderlying Index may be similarly\naffected. In addition to\nscheduled rebalances, the Index\nProvider or its agents may carry\nout ad hoc index rebalances due\nto reaching certain weighting\nconstraints, unusual market\nconditions, corporate events, or\ncorrections of errors. The Fund\nwill in turn rebalance its\nportfolio to attempt to increase\nthe correlation between the\nportfolio and the Underlying\nIndex. The Fund and its\nshareholders will directly bear\nany transaction costs and market\nexposure from such portfolio\nrebalancing. Therefore, index-\nrelated errors and ad hoc\nrebalances may increase the\nFund\u2019s costs and tracking error.\nIssuer Risk. The performance of a\nFund depends on the performance\nof individual securities or other\nassets to which the Fund has\nexposure. The value of securities\nor other assets may decline, or\nperform differently from the\nmarket as a whole, due to changes\nin the financial condition or\ncredit rating of the issuer or\ncounterparty. Large-\nCapitalization Companies Risk.\nLarge-capitalization companies\nmay be less able than smaller-\ncapitalization companies to adapt\nto changing market conditions and\ncompetitive challenges. Large-\ncapitalization companies may be\nmore mature and subject to more\nlimited growth potential compared\nwith smaller-capitalization 6\ncompanies. The performance of\nlarge-capitalization companies\ncould trail the overall\nperformance of the broader\nsecurities markets. Large\nShareholder and Large-Scale\nRedemption Risk. Certain\nshareholders of the Fund,\nincluding an Authorized\nParticipant, a third-party\ninvestor, the Fund\u2019s adviser, an\naffiliate of the Fund\u2019s adviser,\na market maker, or another\nentity, may from time to time own\nor manage a substantial amount of\nFund shares or may hold their\ninvestment in the Fund for a\nlimited period of time. These\nshareholders may also pledge or\nloan Fund shares (to secure\nfinancing or otherwise), which\nmay result in the shares becoming\nconcentrated in another party.\nThere can be no assurance that\nany large shareholder or large\ngroup of shareholders would not\nredeem their investment or that\nthe size of the Fund would be\nmaintained. Redemptions of a\nlarge number of Fund shares may\nadversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nliquidity and net assets. To the\nextent the Fund permits\nredemptions in cash, these\nredemptions may force the Fund to\nsell portfolio securities or\nother assets when it might not\notherwise do so, which may\nnegatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV,\nhave a material effect on the\nmarket price of Fund shares,\nincrease the Fund\u2019s brokerage\ncosts, accelerate the realization\nof taxable income and/or capital\ngains, and cause the Fund to make\ntaxable distributions to its\nshareholders earlier than the\nFund otherwise would have. In\naddition, under certain\ncircumstances, non-redeeming\nshareholders may be treated as\nreceiving a disproportionately\nlarge taxable distribution during\nor with respect to such tax year.\nThe Fund also may be required to\nsell its more liquid investments\nto meet a large redemption, in\nwhich case the Fund\u2019s remaining\nassets may be less liquid, more\nvolatile, and more difficult to\nprice. To the extent these large\nshareholders transact in Fund\nshares on the secondary market,\nsuch transactions may account for\na large percentage of the trading\nvolume for Fund shares and may,\ntherefore, have a material upward\nor downward effect on the market\nprice of the shares. In addition,\nlarge purchases of Fund shares\nmay adversely affect the Fund\u2019s\nperformance to the extent that\nthe Fund is delayed in investing\nnew cash and is required to\nmaintain a larger cash position\nthan it ordinarily would,\ndiluting its investment returns.\nManagement Risk. The Fund is not\nactively managed and invests in\nsecurities or other assets\nincluded in, or representative\nof, its Underlying Index,\nregardless of their investment\nmerits. The Fund may be affected\nby a general decline in market\nsegments related to its\nUnderlying Index, and BFA\ngenerally does not attempt to\ninvest the Fund\u2019s assets in\ndefensive positions under any\nmarket conditions, including\ndeclining markets. Market\ndisruptions and regulatory\nrestrictions could have an\nadverse effect on the Fund\u2019s\nability to adjust its exposure to\nthe required levels in order to\ntrack its Underlying Index.\nBecause BFA uses a representative\nsampling indexing strategy, the\nFund will not fully replicate its\nUnderlying Index and may hold\nsecurities or other assets not\nincluded in the Underlying Index.\nAs a result, the Fund is subject\nto the risk that BFA\u2019s investment\nstrategy, whose implementation is\nsubject to a number of\nconstraints, may not produce the\nintended results. There is no\nguarantee that the Fund\u2019s\ninvestment results will have a\nhigh degree of correlation to\nthose of its Underlying Index or\nthat the Fund will achieve its\ninvestment objective. Market\nRisk. The Fund could lose money\nover short periods due to short-\nterm market movements and over\nlonger periods during more\nprolonged market downturns. The 7\nvalue of a financial instrument\nor other asset may decline due to\nchanges in general market\nconditions, economic trends or\nevents that are not specifically\nrelated to the particular\ninstrument or asset, or factors\nthat affect one or more issuers,\ncounterparties, exchanges,\ncountries or other geographic\nunits, markets, industries, or\nasset classes. Local, regional or\nglobal events such as war, acts\nof terrorism, pandemics or other\npublic health issues, recessions,\nthe prospect or occurrence of a\nsovereign default or other\nfinancial crisis, or other events\ncould have a significant impact\non the Fund and its investments\nand could result in increased\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV. Changes in market and\neconomic conditions generally do\nnot have the same impact on all\ntypes of instruments and assets.\nMarket Trading Risk. The Fund\nfaces numerous market trading\nrisks, any of which may lead to\nits shares trading in the\nsecondary market at a premium or\ndiscount to NAV or to the\nintraday value of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. If you buy\nFund shares at a time when the\nmarket price is at a premium to\nNAV or sell Fund shares at a time\nwhen the market price is at a\ndiscount to the NAV, you may pay\nsignificantly more or receive\nsignificantly less than the\nunderlying value of the Fund\nshares. Absence of an Active\nPrimary Market. Although Fund\nshares are listed for trading on\none or more stock exchanges,\nthere can be no assurance that an\nactive primary trading market for\nFund shares will develop or be\nmaintained by market makers or\nAuthorized Participants.\nSecondary Listing Risks. The\nFund\u2019s shares may be listed or\ntraded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock\nexchanges other than the U.S.\nstock exchange where the Fund\u2019s\nprimary listing is maintained.\nFund shares also may be available\nto non-U.S. investors through\nfunds or structured investment\nvehicles similar to depositary\nreceipts. There can be no\nassurance that the Fund\u2019s shares\nwill continue to trade on any\nsuch stock exchange or in any\nmarket or that the Fund\u2019s shares\nwill continue to meet the\nrequirements for exchange listing\nor market trading. The Fund\u2019s\nshares may be less actively\ntraded in certain markets than in\nothers, and investors are subject\nto the execution and settlement\nrisks and market standards of the\nmarket where they or their broker\ndirect their trades for\nexecution. Certain information\nthat is available to investors\nwho trade Fund shares on a U.S.\nstock exchange during regular\nU.S. market hours may not be\navailable to investors who trade\nin other markets, which may\nresult in secondary market prices\nin such markets being less\nefficient. Secondary Market\nTrading Risk. Shares of the Fund\nmay trade in the secondary market\nat times when the Fund does not\naccept orders to create or redeem\nshares. At such times, shares may\ntrade in the secondary market\nwith more significant premiums or\ndiscounts to NAV than might be\nexperienced at times when the\nFund accepts creation and\nredemption orders. Securities\nheld by the Fund may be traded in\nmarkets that close at a different\ntime than an exchange on which\nFund shares are traded. Liquidity\nin those securities may be\nreduced after the applicable\nclosing time. As a result, during\nthe time when the exchange is\nopen but after the applicable\nmarket closing, fixing or\nsettlement time, there may be\nwider bid/ask spreads on the\nexchange and a greater premium or\ndiscount to NAV. 8 In stressed\nmarket conditions, the market for\nthe Fund\u2019s shares may become less\nliquid in response to\ndeteriorating liquidity in the\nmarkets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings, and an investor may be\nunable to sell their Fund shares.\nSecondary market trading in Fund\nshares may be halted by a stock\nexchange because of market\nconditions or for other reasons.\nIn times of extraordinary market\nvolatility, Fund shares may be\nsubject to trading halts pursuant\nto \u201c circuit breaker \u201d rules of a\nstock exchange or market. If\nthere is a trading halt or\nunanticipated closure of an\nexchange or market, an investor\nmay be unable to purchase or sell\nFund shares. In addition, if\ntrading in certain securities or\nfinancial instruments is\nrestricted, this may disrupt the\nFund\u2019s creation/redemption\nprocess, affect the price at\nwhich Fund shares trade in the\nsecondary market, and result in\nthe Fund being unable to trade\ncertain securities or financial\ninstruments. In such\ncircumstances, the Fund may be\nunable to rebalance its portfolio\nor accurately price its portfolio\nholdings and may incur\nsubstantial trading losses.\nShares of the Fund, similar to\nshares of other issuers listed on\na stock exchange, may be sold\nshort and are therefore subject\nto the risk of increased\nvolatility and price decreases\nassociated with being sold short.\nIn addition, trading activity in\nderivative products based on the\nFund may lead to increased\ntrading volume and volatility in\nthe secondary market for the\nshares of the Fund. Fund Shares\nMay Trade at Prices Other Than\nNAV . Shares of the Fund trade on\nstock exchanges at prices at,\nabove or below the Fund\u2019s most\nrecent NAV. The Fund\u2019s NAV is\ncalculated at the end of each\nbusiness day and fluctuates with\nchanges in the market value of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio holdings.\nThe trading price of the Fund\u2019s\nshares fluctuates throughout\ntrading hours based on both\nmarket supply of and demand for\nFund shares and the underlying\nvalue of the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nholdings or NAV. As a result, the\ntrading prices of the Fund\u2019s\nshares may deviate significantly\nfrom NAV during times of market\nvolatility, significant\nredemption requests, or other\nunusual market conditions\nHowever, because Fund shares can\nbe created and redeemed in\nCreation Units at NAV, BFA\nbelieves that large discounts or\npremiums to the Fund\u2019s NAV are\nnot likely to be sustained over\nthe long term (unlike shares of\nmany closed-end funds, which\nfrequently trade at appreciable\ndiscounts from, and sometimes at\npremiums to, their NAVs). While\nthe creation/redemption feature\nis designed to make it more\nlikely that the Fund\u2019s shares\nnormally will trade on stock\nexchanges at prices close to the\nFund\u2019s next calculated NAV,\nexchange prices are not expected\nto correlate exactly with the\nFund\u2019s NAV due to timing reasons,\nsupply and demand imbalances and\nother factors. In addition,\ndisruptions to creations and\nredemptions, including\ndisruptions at market makers,\nAuthorized Participants, or other\nmarket participants, and during\nperiods of significant market\nvolatility, may result in trading\nprices for shares of the Fund\nthat differ significantly from\nits NAV. Authorized Participants\nmay be less willing to create or\nredeem the Fund\u2019s shares if there\nis a lack of an active market for\nsuch shares or the Fund\u2019s\nunderlying investments, which may\ncontribute to the Fund\u2019s shares\ntrading at a premium or discount\nto NAV. Costs of Buying or\nSelling Fund Shares. Buying or\nselling Fund shares on an\nexchange involves two types of\ncosts that apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling Fund shares\nthrough a broker, you will likely\nincur a brokerage commission and\n9 other charges. In addition, you\nmay incur the cost of the \u201c\nspread, \u201d which is the difference\nbetween what investors are\nwilling to pay for Fund shares\n(the \u201c bid \u201d price) and the price\nat which they are willing to sell\nFund shares (the \u201c ask \u201d price).\nThe spread varies over time for\nFund shares based on trading\nvolume and market liquidity. It\nis generally narrower if the Fund\nhas more trading volume and\nmarket liquidity and wider if the\nFund has less trading volume and\nmarket liquidity. Increased\nmarket volatility also may cause\nwider spreads. In addition, there\nmay be regulatory and other\ncharges that are incurred as a\nresult of trading activity.\nBecause of the costs inherent in\nbuying or selling Fund shares,\nfrequent trading may detract\nsignificantly from investment\nresults, and an investment in\nFund shares may not be advisable\nfor investors who anticipate\nregularly making small\ninvestments through a brokerage\naccount. National Closed Market\nTrading Risk. To the extent that\nsecurities or other assets held\nby the Fund trade on foreign\nexchanges or in foreign markets\nthat may be closed when the\nsecurities exchange on which the\nFund\u2019s shares trade is open,\nthere are likely to be deviations\nbetween such asset\u2019s current\nprice and its last quoted price (\ni.e ., the quote from the closed\nforeign market to the Fund). The\nimpact of a closed foreign market\non the Fund is likely to be\ngreater where a large portion of\nthe Fund\u2019s holdings trade on a\nclosed foreign market or when a\nforeign market is closed for\nunscheduled reasons. These\ndeviations could result in\npremiums or discounts to the\nFund\u2019s NAV that may be greater\nthan those experienced by other\nfunds. Non-U.S. Securities Risk.\nInvestments in the securities of\nnon-U.S. issuers are subject to\nthe risks of investing in the\nmarkets where such issuers are\nlocated, including heightened\nrisks of inflation,\nnationalization and market\nfluctuations caused by economic\nand political developments. As a\nresult of investing in non-U.S.\nsecurities, the Fund may be\nsubject to increased risk of loss\ncaused by any of the factors\nlisted below: \u25a0 Government\nintervention in issuers'\noperations or structure; \u25a0 A lack\nof market liquidity and market\nefficiency; \u25a0 Greater securities\nprice volatility; \u25a0 Exchange rate\nfluctuations and exchange\ncontrols; \u25a0 Less availability of\npublic information about issuers;\n\u25a0 Limitations on foreign\nownership of securities; \u25a0\nImposition of withholding or\nother taxes; \u25a0 Imposition of\nrestrictions on the expatriation\nof the funds or other assets of\nthe Fund; \u25a0 Higher transaction\nand custody costs and delays in\nsettlement procedures; \u25a0\nDifficulties in enforcing\ncontractual obligations; \u25a0 Lower\nlevels of regulation of the\nsecurities markets; \u25a0 Weaker\naccounting, disclosure and\nreporting requirements and the\nrisk of being delisted from U.S.\nexchanges; and \u25a0 Legal principles\nrelating to corporate governance,\ndirectors\u2019 fiduciary duties and\n10 liabilities and stockholders\u2019\nrights in markets in which the\nFund invests may differ from or\nmay not be as extensive or\nprotective as those that apply in\nthe U.S. Withholding Tax Reclaims\nRisk . The Fund may file claims\nto recover withholding tax on\ndividend and interest income (if\nany) received from issuers in\ncertain countries where such\nwithholding tax reclaim is\npossible. Whether or when the\nFund will receive a withholding\ntax refund in the future is\nwithin the control of the tax\nauthorities in such countries.\nWhere the Fund expects to recover\nwithholding tax based on a\ncontinuous assessment of\nprobability of recovery, the NAV\nof the Fund generally includes\naccruals for such tax refunds.\nThe Fund continues to evaluate\ntax developments for potential\nimpact to the probability of\nrecovery. If the likelihood of\nreceiving refunds materially\ndecreases, for example due to a\nchange in tax regulation or\napproach, accruals in the Fund\u2019s\nNAV for such refunds may need to\nbe written down partially or in\nfull, which will adversely affect\nthat Fund\u2019s NAV. Investors in the\nFund at the time an accrual is\nwritten down will bear the impact\nof any resulting reduction in NAV\nregardless of whether they were\ninvestors during the accrual\nperiod. Conversely, if a Fund\nreceives a tax refund that has\nnot been previously accrued,\ninvestors in the Fund at the time\nthe claim is successful will\nbenefit from any resulting\nincrease in the Fund\u2019s NAV.\nInvestors who sold their shares\nprior to such time will not\nbenefit from such NAV increase.\nOperational Risk. The Fund is\nexposed to operational risks\narising from a number of factors,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nhuman error, processing and\ncommunication errors, errors of\nthe Fund\u2019s service providers,\ncounterparties or other third\nparties, failed or inadequate\nprocesses and technology or\nsystems failures. The Fund and\nBFA seek to reduce these\noperational risks through\ncontrols and procedures. However,\nthese measures do not address\nevery possible risk and may be\ninadequate to address significant\noperational risks. Risk of\nInvesting in Developed Countries.\nInvestment in developed country\nissuers will subject the Fund to\nlegal, regulatory, political,\ncurrency, security, economic and\nother risks associated with\ndeveloped countries. Developed\ncountries generally tend to rely\non services sectors ( e.g., the\nfinancial services sector) as the\nprimary means of economic growth.\nA prolonged slowdown in one or\nmore services sectors is likely\nto have a negative impact on\neconomies of certain developed\ncountries, although economies of\nindividual developed countries\ncan be impacted by slowdowns in\nother sectors. In the past,\ncertain developed countries have\nbeen targets of terrorism, and\nsome geographic areas in which\nthe Fund invests have experienced\nstrained international relations\ndue to territorial disputes,\nhistorical animosities, defense\nconcerns and other security\nconcerns. These situations may\ncause uncertainty in the\nfinancial markets in these\ncountries or geographic areas and\nmay adversely affect the\nperformance of the issuers to\nwhich the Fund has exposure.\nHeavy regulation of certain\nmarkets, including labor and\nproduct markets, may have an\nadverse effect on certain\nissuers. Such regulations may\nnegatively affect economic growth\nor cause prolonged periods of\nrecession. Many developed\ncountries are heavily indebted\nand face rising healthcare and\nretirement expenses. In addition,\nprice fluctuations of certain\ncommodities and regulations\nimpacting the import of\ncommodities may negatively affect\ndeveloped country economies. 11\nRisk of Investing in the U.S.\nInvesting in U.S. issuers\ninvolves legal, regulatory,\npolitical, currency, security,\nand economic risks that are\nspecific to the U.S. A decrease\nin imports or exports, changes in\ntrade regulations, inflation, an\neconomic recession, financial\nsystem stress, or political\nturmoil, among other risks, may\nhave an adverse effect on the\nU.S. economy and the securities\nlisted on U.S. exchanges. The\nU.S. is also subject to the risk\nof natural disasters, such as\ndroughts, earthquakes, fires and\nfloods. U.S. security risks\ninclude acts of terrorism,\ninternal unrest and a\ndeterioration in relations\nbetween the U.S. and certain\ncountries. Any of these may\nadversely affect the U.S.\neconomy, financial markets or\nissuers. Governmental agencies\nproject that the U.S. will\nmaintain elevated public debt\nlevels for the foreseeable\nfuture. Although elevated debt\nlevels do not necessarily\nindicate or cause economic\nproblems, the costs of servicing\nsuch debt may constrain future\neconomic growth. Circumstances\ncould arise that could prevent\nthe timely payment of interest or\nprincipal on U.S. government\ndebt, such as reaching the\nlegislative \u201c debt ceiling. \u201d\nSuch non-payment would result in\nsubstantial negative consequences\nfor the U.S. economy and the\nglobal financial system.\nSecurities Lending Risk. The Fund\nmay engage in securities lending.\nSecurities lending involves the\nrisk that the Fund may lose money\nbecause the borrower of the\nloaned securities fails to return\nthe securities in a timely manner\nor at all. The Fund could also\nlose money in the event of a\ndecline in the value of\ncollateral provided for loaned\nsecurities or a decline in the\nvalue of any investments made\nwith cash collateral. These\nevents could also trigger adverse\ntax consequences for the Fund.\nSecurity Risk. Some geographic\nareas in which the Fund invests\nhave experienced acts of\nterrorism and strained\ninternational relations due to\nterritorial disputes, historical\nanimosities, defense concerns and\nother security concerns. These\nsituations may cause uncertainty\nin the markets of these\ngeographic areas and may\nadversely affect their economies.\nTracking Error Risk. The Fund may\nbe subject to \u201c tracking error, \u201d\nwhich is the divergence of the\nFund\u2019s performance from that of\nthe Underlying Index. Tracking\nerror may occur because of\ndifferences between the\nsecurities and other instruments\nheld in the Fund\u2019s portfolio and\nthose included in the Underlying\nIndex, pricing differences\n(including, as applicable,\ndifferences between a security\u2019s\nprice at the local market close\nand the Fund's valuation of a\nsecurity at the time of\ncalculation of the Fund's NAV),\ntransaction costs incurred by the\nFund, the Fund\u2019s holding of\nuninvested cash, differences in\ntiming of the accrual or the\nvaluation of dividends or\ninterest received by the Fund or\ndistributions paid to the Fund\u2019s\nshareholders, the requirements to\nmaintain pass-through tax\ntreatment, portfolio transactions\ncarried out to minimize the\ndistribution of capital gains to\nshareholders, acceptance of\ncustom baskets, changes to the\nUnderlying Index or the costs to\nthe Fund of complying with\nvarious new or existing\nregulatory requirements, among\nother reasons. This risk may be\nheightened during times of\nincreased market volatility or\nother unusual market conditions.\nTracking error also may result\nbecause the Fund incurs fees and\nexpenses, while the Underlying\nIndex does not. Tracking error\nmay occur due to differences\nbetween the methodologies used in\ncalculating the value of the\nUnderlying Index and determining\nthe Fund\u2019s NAV. 12 Utilities\nSector Risk. Companies in the\nutilities sector may be adversely\naffected by changes in exchange\nrates, domestic and international\ncompetition, and governmental\nlimitations on rates charged to\nconsumers. The value of regulated\nutility debt securities (and, to\na lesser extent, equity\nsecurities) tends to have an\ninverse relationship to the\nmovement of interest rates.\nDeregulation may subject utility\ncompanies to greater competition\nand may adversely affect their\nprofitability. Federal\nlegislation may facilitate the\nconstruction of electric\ntransmission lines not only by\npublic utilities but also by\nindependent transmission\ndevelopers, which could increase\ncompetition in the wholesale\nelectricity markets. As\nderegulation allows utility\ncompanies to diversify outside of\ntheir original geographic regions\nand their traditional lines of\nbusiness, utility companies may\nengage in riskier ventures. In\naddition, deregulation may\neliminate restrictions on the\nprofits of certain utility\ncompanies, but may also subject\nthese companies to greater risk\nof loss. Companies in the\nutilities industry may have\ndifficulty obtaining an adequate\nreturn on invested capital,\nraising capital, or financing\nlarge construction projects\nduring periods of inflation or\nunsettled capital markets; face\nrestrictions on operations and\nincreased cost and delays\nattributable to environmental\nconsiderations and regulation;\nfind that existing plants,\nequipment or products have been\nrendered obsolete by\ntechnological innovations; or be\nsubject to increased costs\nbecause of the scarcity of\ncertain fuels or the effects of\nman-made or natural disasters.\nExisting and future regulations\nor legislation may make it\ndifficult for utility companies\nto operate profitably. Government\nregulators monitor and control\nutility revenues and costs, and\ntherefore may limit utility\nprofits. In certain countries,\nregulatory authorities may also\nrestrict utility companies\u2019\naccess to new markets, thereby\ndiminishing these companies\u2019\nlong-term prospects. There is no\nassurance that regulatory\nauthorities will grant rate\nincreases in the future or that\nsuch increases will be adequate\nto permit the payment of\ndividends on stocks issued by a\nutility company. Energy\nconservation and changes in\nclimate policy may also have a\nsignificant adverse impact on the\nrevenues and expenses of utility\ncompanies. Valuation Risk. The\nprice that the Fund could receive\nupon the sale (or other\ndisposition) of a security or\nother asset may differ from the\nFund\u2019s valuation of the security\nor other asset, particularly for\nsecurities or other assets that\ntrade in low volume or volatile\nmarkets or that are valued using\na fair value methodology. The\nprice received by the Fund also\nmay differ from the value used by\nthe Underlying Index (if\napplicable). Because non-U.S.\nexchanges or markets may be open\non days or during time periods\nwhen the Fund does not price its\nshares, the value of the\nsecurities or other assets in the\nFund\u2019s portfolio may change on\ndays or during time periods when\ninvestors are not able to\npurchase or sell Fund shares. In\naddition, for purposes of\ncalculating the Fund's NAV, the\nvalue of assets denominated in\nnon-U.S. currencies (if any) is\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at\nthe prevailing market rates. This\ntranslation may result in a\ndifference between the prices\nused to calculate the Fund's NAV\nand the prices used by the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference\nbetween the Fund's performance\nand the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Authorized\nParticipants that create or\nredeem Fund shares on days when\nthe Fund is holding fair-valued\nsecurities or other assets may\nreceive fewer or more shares, or\nlower or higher redemption\nproceeds, than they would have\nreceived had the securities or\nother assets not been fair valued\nor been 13 valued using a\ndifferent methodology. The\nability to value investments may\nbe impacted by technological\nissues or errors by pricing\nservices or other third-party\nservice providers. A Further\nDiscussion of Other Risks The\nFund may also be subject to\ncertain other risks associated\nwith its investments and\ninvestment strategies. The order\nof the below risk factors does\nnot indicate the significance of\nany particular risk factor.\nBorrowing Risk. Borrowing may\nexaggerate changes in a Fund\u2019s\nNAV and in the return on its\nportfolio. A Fund that borrows\nwill incur interest expenses and\nother fees, which may reduce the\nFund\u2019s return. Borrowing may also\ncause a Fund to liquidate\npositions when it may not be\nadvantageous to do so to satisfy\nits obligations. Close-Out Risk\nfor Qualified Financial\nContracts. Regulations adopted by\nglobal prudential regulators\nrequire counterparties that are\npart of U.S. or foreign global\nsystemically important banking\norganizations to include\ncontractual restrictions on\nclose-out and cross-default in\nagreements relating to qualified\nfinancial contracts. Qualified\nfinancial contracts include\nagreements relating to swaps,\ncurrency forwards and other\nderivatives as well as repurchase\nagreements and securities lending\nagreements. The restrictions\nprevent a Fund from closing out a\nqualified financial contract\nduring a specified time period if\nthe counterparty is subject to\nresolution proceedings and also\nprohibit a Fund from exercising\ndefault rights due to a\nreceivership or similar\nproceeding of an affiliate of the\ncounterparty. These requirements\nmay increase credit risk and\nother risks to a Fund. Illiquid\nInvestments Risk. The Fund may\nnot acquire any illiquid\ninvestment if, immediately after\nthe acquisition, the Fund would\nhave invested more than 15% of\nits net assets in illiquid\ninvestments. An illiquid\ninvestment is any investment that\nthe Fund reasonably expects\ncannot be sold or disposed of in\ncurrent market conditions in\nseven calendar days or less\nwithout significantly changing\nthe market value of the\ninvestment. Liquid investments\nmay become illiquid after\npurchase by the Fund,\nparticularly during periods of\nmarket turmoil. There can be no\nassurance that a security or\ninstrument that is deemed to be\nliquid when purchased will\ncontinue to be liquid for as long\nas it is held by the Fund, and\nany security or instrument held\nby the Fund may be deemed an\nilliquid investment pursuant to\nthe Fund\u2019s liquidity risk\nmanagement program. To the extent\nthe Fund holds illiquid\ninvestments, the illiquid\ninvestments may reduce the\nreturns of the Fund because the\nFund may be unable to transact at\nadvantageous times or prices. An\ninvestment may be illiquid due\nto, among other things, the\nreduced number and capacity of\ntraditional market participants\nto make a market in securities or\ninstruments, the lack of an\nactive market for such securities\nor instruments, capital controls,\ndelays or limits on repatriation\nof local currency, or insolvency\nof local governments. To the\nextent that the Fund invests in\nsecurities or instruments with\nsubstantial market and/or credit\nrisk, the Fund will tend to have\nincreased exposure to the risks\nassociated with illiquid\ninvestments. Illiquid investments\nmay be harder to value,\nespecially in changing markets.\nAlthough the Fund primarily seeks\nto redeem shares of the Fund on\nan in-kind basis, if the Fund is\nforced to sell underlying\ninvestments at reduced prices or\nunder unfavorable conditions to\n14 meet redemption requests or\nfor other cash needs, the Fund\nmay suffer a loss. This may be\nmagnified in a rising interest\nrate environment or other\ncircumstances where redemptions\nfrom the Fund may be greater than\nnormal. Other market participants\nmay be attempting to liquidate\nholdings at the same time as the\nFund, causing increased supply of\nthe Fund\u2019s underlying investments\nin the market and contributing to\nilliquid investments risk and\ndownward pricing pressure. In\naddition, if the Fund is limited\nin its ability to sell illiquid\ninvestments during periods when\nshareholders are redeeming their\nshares, the Fund will need to\nsell liquid securities to meet\nredemption requests and illiquid\nsecurities will become a larger\nportion of the Fund\u2019s holdings.\nDuring periods of market\nvolatility, liquidity in the\nmarket for the Fund\u2019s shares may\nbe impacted by the liquidity in\nthe market for the underlying\nsecurities or instruments held by\nthe Fund, which could lead to the\nFund\u2019s shares trading at a\npremium or discount to the Fund's\nNAV. Threshold/Underinvestment\nRisk. If certain aggregate and/or\nfund-level ownership thresholds\nare reached through transactions\nundertaken by BFA, its affiliates\nor the Fund, or as a result of\nthird-party transactions or\nactions by an issuer or\nregulator, the ability of BFA and\nits affiliates on behalf of\nclients (including the Fund) to\npurchase or dispose of\ninvestments, exercise rights or\nundertake business transactions\nmay be restricted by regulation\nor otherwise impaired. The\ncapacity of the Fund to invest in\ncertain securities or other\nassets may be affected by the\nrelevant threshold limits, and\nsuch limitations may have adverse\neffects on the liquidity and\nperformance of the Fund\u2019s\nportfolio holdings. To the extent\na Fund tracks an index, such\nlimits may increase the risk of\nthe Fund being underinvested in\nan asset relative to its\nUnderlying Index and increase the\nrisk of tracking error. For\nexample, ownership limits may\napply to securities whose issuers\noperate in certain regulated\nindustries or in certain\ninternational markets. Such\nlimits also may apply where the\ninvesting entity (such as the\nFund) is subject to corporate or\nregulatory ownership restrictions\nor invests in certain futures or\nother derivative transactions. In\ncertain circumstances, aggregate\nand/or fund-level amounts\ninvested or voted by BFA and its\naffiliates for their proprietary\naccounts and for client accounts\n(including the Fund) may not\nexceed the relevant limits\nwithout the grant of a license or\nother regulatory or corporate\nconsent. In other cases,\nexceeding such thresholds may\ncause BFA and its affiliates, the\nFund or other client accounts to\nsuffer disadvantages or business\nrestrictions. Portfolio Holdings\nInformation A description of the\nTrust's policies and procedures\nwith respect to the disclosure of\nthe Fund\u2019s portfolio securities\nis available in the Fund's\nStatement of Additional\nInformation ( \u201c SAI \u201d ). The Fund\ndiscloses its portfolio holdings\ndaily at www.iShares.com. Fund\nfact sheets providing information\nregarding the Fund's top holdings\nare posted on www.iShares.com\nwhen available and may be\nrequested by calling\n1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).\n15 Management Investment Adviser.\nAs investment adviser, BFA has\noverall responsibility for the\ngeneral management and\nadministration of the Fund. BFA\nprovides an investment program\nfor the Fund and manages the\ninvestment of the Fund\u2019s assets.\nIn managing the Fund, BFA may\ndraw upon the research and\nexpertise of its asset management\naffiliates with respect to\ncertain portfolio securities. In\nseeking to achieve the Fund's\ninvestment objective, BFA uses\nteams of portfolio managers,\ninvestment strategists and other\ninvestment specialists. This team\napproach brings together many\ndisciplines and leverages BFA\u2019s\nextensive resources. Pursuant to\nthe Investment Advisory Agreement\nbetween BFA and the Trust\n(entered into on behalf of the\nFund), BFA is responsible for\nsubstantially all expenses of the\nFund, except the management fees,\ninterest expenses, taxes,\nexpenses incurred with respect to\nthe acquisition and disposition\nof portfolio securities and the\nexecution of portfolio\ntransactions, including brokerage\ncommissions, distribution fees or\nexpenses, and litigation expenses\nand any extraordinary expenses\n(as determined by a majority of\nthe Trustees who are not \u201c\ninterested persons \u201d of the\nTrust). Operating expenses paid\nby BFA under the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement exclude\nacquired fund fees and expenses,\nif any. For its investment\nadvisory services to the Fund,\nBFA is paid a management fee from\nthe Fund corresponding to the\nFund\u2019s allocable portion of an\naggregate management fee\ncalculated based on the aggregate\naverage daily net assets of the\nfollowing iShares funds: iShares\nExpanded Tech Sector ETF, iShares\nExpanded Tech-Software Sector\nETF, iShares Global Clean Energy\nETF, iShares Global Comm Services\nETF, iShares Global Consumer\nDiscretionary ETF, iShares Global\nConsumer Staples ETF, iShares\nGlobal Energy ETF, iShares Global\nFinancials ETF, iShares Global\nHealthcare ETF, iShares Global\nIndustrials ETF, iShares Global\nInfrastructure ETF, iShares\nGlobal Materials ETF, iShares\nGlobal Tech ETF, iShares Global\nTimber & Forestry ETF, iShares\nGlobal Utilities ETF, iShares\nNorth American Natural Resources\nETF, iShares Semiconductor ETF,\nand iShares U.S. Digital\nInfrastructure and Real Estate\nETF. The aggregate management fee\nis calculated as follows: 0.4800%\nper annum of the aggregate net\nassets less than or equal to\n$10.0 billion, plus 0.4300% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets\nover $10.0 billion, up to and\nincluding $20.0 billion, plus\n0.3800% per annum of the\naggregate net assets over $20.0\nbillion, up to and including\n$30.0 billion, plus 0.3420% per\nannum of the aggregate net assets\nover $30.0 billion, up to and\nincluding $40.0 billion, plus\n0.3078% per annum of the\naggregate net assets in excess of\n$40.0 billion. For the fiscal\nyear ended March 31, 2024, BFA\nwas paid a management fee from\nthe Fund, as a percentage of the\nFund's average daily net assets,\nat the annual rate of 0.41%. BFA\nmay from time to time voluntarily\nwaive and/or reimburse fees or\nexpenses in order to limit total\nannual fund operating expenses\n(excluding acquired fund fees and\nexpenses, if any). Any such\nvoluntary waiver or reimbursement\nmay be eliminated by BFA at any\ntime. BFA is located at 400\nHoward Street, San Francisco, CA\n94105. It is an indirect wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BlackRock,\nInc. ( \u201c BlackRock \u201d ). As of\nMarch 31, 2024, BFA and its 16\naffiliates provided investment\nadvisory services for assets of\napproximately $10.5 trillion. BFA\nand its affiliates trade and\ninvest for their own accounts in\nthe actual securities and types\nof securities in which the Fund\nmay also invest, which may affect\nthe price of such securities. A\ndiscussion regarding the basis\nfor the approval by the Trust's\nBoard of Trustees (the \u201c Board \u201d\n) of the Investment Advisory\nAgreement with BFA is available\nin the Fund's Semi-Annual Report\nfor the period ended September\n30. Portfolio Managers. Jennifer\nHsui, Greg Savage and Paul\nWhitehead are primarily\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of the Fund. The\nPortfolio Managers are\nresponsible for various functions\nrelated to portfolio management,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ninvesting cash inflows,\ncoordinating with members of\ntheir respective portfolio\nmanagement teams to focus on\ncertain asset classes,\nimplementing investment strategy,\nresearching and reviewing\ninvestment strategy and\noverseeing members of their\nrespective portfolio management\nteams who have more limited\nresponsibilities. Jennifer Hsui\nhas been employed by BFA or its\naffiliates as a senior portfolio\nmanager since 2007. Prior to\nthat, Ms. Hsui was a portfolio\nmanager from 2006 to 2007 for\nBarclays Global Fund Advisors ( \u201c\nBGFA \u201d ). Ms. Hsui has been a\nPortfolio Manager of the Fund\nsince 2012. Greg Savage has been\nemployed by BFA or its affiliates\nas a senior portfolio manager\nsince 2006. Prior to that, Mr.\nSavage was a portfolio manager\nfrom 2001 to 2006 for BGFA. Mr.\nSavage has been a Portfolio\nManager of the Fund since 2008.\nPaul Whitehead has been with\nBlackRock since 1996, including\nhis years with Barclays Global\nInvestors ( \u201c BGI \u201d ), which\nmerged with BlackRock in 2009.\nMr. Whitehead has been employed\nby BlackRock as a Managing\nDirector since 2010 and a\nDirector from 2009 to 2010. Mr.\nWhitehead was employed by BGI as\nPrincipal from 2002 to 2009. Mr.\nWhitehead has been a Portfolio\nManager of the Fund since 2022.\nThe Fund's SAI provides\nadditional information about the\nPortfolio Managers' compensation,\nother accounts managed by the\nPortfolio Managers and the\nPortfolio Managers' ownership (if\nany) of shares in the Fund.\nAdministrator, Custodian and\nTransfer Agent. State Street Bank\nand Trust Company ( \u201c State\nStreet \u201d ) is the administrator,\ncustodian and transfer agent for\nthe Fund. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. serves as custodian for the\nFund in connection with certain\nsecurities lending activities.\nConflicts of Interest. The\ninvestment activities of BFA and\nits affiliates (including\nBlackRock and its subsidiaries\n(collectively, the \u201c Affiliates \u201d\n)), and their respective\ndirectors, officers or employees,\nin the management of, or their\ninterest in, their own accounts\nand other accounts they manage,\nmay present conflicts of interest\nthat could disadvantage the Fund\nand its shareholders. BFA and its\nAffiliates provide investment\nmanagement services to other\nfunds and discretionary managed\naccounts that may follow\ninvestment programs similar to\nthat of the Fund. BFA and its\nAffiliates are involved worldwide\nwith a broad spectrum of\nfinancial services and asset\nmanagement activities and may\nengage in the ordinary course of\nbusiness in activities in which\ntheir interests or the interests\nof their clients may conflict\nwith those of the Fund. BFA or 17\none or more Affiliates act, or\nmay act, as an investor, research\nprovider, investment manager,\ncommodity pool operator,\ncommodity trading advisor,\nfinancier, underwriter, adviser,\ntrader, lender, index provider,\nagent and/or principal, and have\nother direct and indirect\ninterests in securities,\ncurrencies, commodities,\nderivatives and other instruments\nin which the Fund may directly or\nindirectly invest. The Fund may\ninvest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions\nwith, companies with which an\nAffiliate has significant debt or\nequity investments or other\ninterests. The Fund may also\ninvest in issuances (such as\nstructured notes) by entities for\nwhich an Affiliate provides and\nis compensated for cash\nmanagement services relating to\nthe proceeds from the sale of\nsuch issuances. The Fund also may\ninvest in securities of, or\nengage in other transactions\nwith, companies for which an\nAffiliate provides or may in the\nfuture provide research coverage.\nAn Affiliate may have business\nrelationships with, and purchase\nor distribute or sell services or\nproducts from or to,\ndistributors, consultants or\nothers who recommend the Fund or\nwho engage in transactions with\nor for the Fund, and may receive\ncompensation for such services.\nBFA or one or more Affiliates may\nengage in proprietary trading and\nadvise accounts and funds that\nhave investment objectives\nsimilar to those of the Fund\nand/or that engage in and compete\nfor transactions in the same\ntypes of securities, currencies\nand other instruments as the\nFund. This may include\ntransactions in securities issued\nby other open-end and closed-end\ninvestment companies (which may\ninclude investment companies that\nare affiliated with the Fund and\nBFA, to the extent permitted\nunder the Investment Company Act\nof 1940, as amended (the \u201c 1940\nAct \u201d )). The trading activities\nof BFA and these Affiliates are\ncarried out without reference to\npositions held directly or\nindirectly by the Fund and may\nresult in BFA or an Affiliate\nhaving positions in certain\nsecurities that are senior or\njunior to, or have interests\ndifferent from or adverse to, the\nsecurities that are owned by the\nFund. Neither BlackRock nor any\nAffiliate is under any obligation\nto share any investment\nopportunity, idea or strategy\nwith the Fund. As a result, an\nAffiliate may compete with the\nFund for appropriate investment\nopportunities. The results of the\nFund's investment activities,\ntherefore, may differ from those\nof an Affiliate and of other\naccounts managed by BlackRock or\nan Affiliate, and it is possible\nthat the Fund could sustain\nlosses during periods in which\none or more Affiliates and other\naccounts achieve profits on their\ntrading for proprietary or other\naccounts. The opposite result is\nalso possible. In addition, the\nFund may, from time to time,\nenter into transactions in which\nBFA or an Affiliate or its or\ntheir directors, officers,\nemployees or clients have an\nadverse interest. Furthermore,\ntransactions undertaken by\nclients advised or managed by BFA\nor its Affiliates may adversely\nimpact the Fund. Transactions by\none or more clients or by BFA or\nits Affiliates or their\ndirectors, officers or employees\nmay have the effect of diluting\nor otherwise disadvantaging the\nvalues, prices or investment\nstrategies of the Fund. The\nFund's activities may be limited\nbecause of regulatory\nrestrictions applicable to BFA or\none or more Affiliates and/or\ntheir internal policies designed\nto comply with such restrictions.\n18 Under a securities lending\nprogram approved by the Board,\nthe Fund has retained BTC, an\nAffiliate of BFA, to serve as the\nsecurities lending agent for the\nFund to the extent that the Fund\nparticipates in the securities\nlending program. For these\nservices, the securities lending\nagent will receive a fee from the\nFund based on the returns earned\non the Fund\u2019s lending activities,\nincluding investment of the cash\nreceived as collateral for the\nloaned securities. In addition,\none or more Affiliates may be\namong the entities to which the\nFund may lend its portfolio\nsecurities under the securities\nlending program. It is also\npossible that, from time to time,\nBlackRock and/or its advisory\nclients (including other funds\nand separately managed accounts)\nmay, subject to compliance with\napplicable law, purchase and hold\nshares of the Fund. The price,\navailability, liquidity, and (in\nsome cases) expense ratio of the\nFund may be impacted by purchases\nand sales of the Fund by\nBlackRock and/or its advisory\nclients. The activities of BFA\nand its Affiliates and their\nrespective directors, officers or\nemployees may give rise to other\nconflicts of interest that could\ndisadvantage the Fund and its\nshareholders. BFA has adopted\npolicies and procedures designed\nto address these potential\nconflicts of interest. See the\nSAI for further information.\nShareholder Information\nAdditional shareholder\ninformation, including how to buy\nand sell shares of the Fund, is\navailable free of charge by\ncalling toll-free: 1-800-iShares\n(1-800-474-2737) or visiting our\nwebsite at www.iShares.com.\nBuying and Selling Shares. Shares\nof the Fund may be acquired or\nredeemed directly from the Fund\nonly in Creation Units or\nmultiples thereof, as discussed\nin the Creations and Redemptions\nsection of this Prospectus. Only\nan Authorized Participant may\nengage in creation or redemption\ntransactions directly with the\nFund. Once created, shares of the\nFund generally trade in the\nsecondary market in amounts less\nthan a Creation Unit. Shares of\nthe Fund are listed on a national\nsecurities exchange for trading\nduring the trading day. Shares\ncan be bought and sold throughout\nthe trading day like shares of\nother publicly traded companies.\nThe Trust does not impose any\nminimum investment for shares of\nthe Fund purchased on an exchange\nor otherwise in the secondary\nmarket. The Fund's shares trade\nunder the ticker symbol \u201c JXI. \u201d\nBuying or selling Fund shares on\nan exchange or other secondary\nmarket involves two types of\ncosts that may apply to all\nsecurities transactions. When\nbuying or selling shares of the\nFund through a broker, you may\nincur a brokerage commission and\nother charges. The commission is\nfrequently a fixed amount and may\nbe a significant proportional\ncost for investors seeking to buy\nor sell small amounts of shares.\nIn addition, you may incur the\ncost of the \u201c spread, \u201d that is,\nany difference between the bid\nprice and the ask price. The\nspread varies over time for\nshares of the Fund based on the\nFund\u2019s trading volume and market\nliquidity, and is generally lower\nif the Fund has high trading\nvolume and market liquidity, and\nhigher if the Fund has little\ntrading volume and market\nliquidity (which is often the\ncase for funds that are newly\nlaunched or small in size). The\nFund's spread may also be\nimpacted by the liquidity or\nilliquidity 19 of the underlying\nsecurities held by the Fund,\nparticularly for newly launched\nor smaller funds or in instances\nof significant volatility of the\nunderlying securities. The Fund\ndoes not impose restrictions on\nthe frequency of purchases and\nredemptions of Fund shares\ndirectly with the Fund. The Board\ndetermined not to adopt policies\nand procedures designed to\nprevent or monitor for frequent\npurchases and redemptions of Fund\nshares because the Fund generally\nsells and redeems its shares\ndirectly through transactions\nthat are in-kind and/or for cash,\nwith a deadline for placing cash-\nrelated transactions no later\nthan the close of the primary\nmarkets for the Fund\u2019s portfolio\nsecurities. However, the Fund has\ntaken certain measures ( e.g .,\nimposing transaction fees on\npurchases and redemptions of\nCreation Units and reserving the\nright to reject purchases of\nCreation Units under certain\ncircumstances) to minimize the\npotential consequences of\nfrequent cash purchases and\nredemptions by Authorized\nParticipants, such as increased\ntracking error, disruption of\nportfolio management, dilution to\nthe Fund, and/or increased\ntransaction costs. Further, the\nvast majority of trading in Fund\nshares occurs on the secondary\nmarket, which does not involve\nthe Fund directly, and such\ntrading is unlikely to cause many\nof the harmful effects of\nfrequent cash purchases or\nredemptions of Fund shares. The\nnational securities exchange on\nwhich the Fund's shares are\nlisted is open for trading Monday\nthrough Friday and is closed on\nweekends and the following\nholidays (or the days on which\nthey are observed): New Year\u2019s\nDay, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,\nPresidents\u2019 Day, Good Friday,\nMemorial Day, Juneteenth,\nIndependence Day, Labor Day,\nThanksgiving Day and Christmas\nDay. The Fund\u2019s primary listing\nexchange is NYSE Arca. Section\n12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act\ngenerally restricts investments\nby investment companies,\nincluding foreign and\nunregistered investment\ncompanies, in the securities of\nother investment companies. For\nexample, a registered investment\ncompany (the \u201c Acquired Fund \u201d ),\nsuch as the Fund, may not\nknowingly sell or otherwise\ndispose of any security issued by\nthe Acquired Fund to any\ninvestment company (the \u201c\nAcquiring Fund \u201d ) or any company\nor companies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund if, immediately\nafter such sale or disposition:\n(i) more than 3% of the total\noutstanding voting stock of the\nAcquired Fund is owned by the\nAcquiring Fund and any company or\ncompanies controlled by the\nAcquiring Fund, or (ii) more than\n10% of the total outstanding\nvoting stock of the Acquired Fund\nis owned by the Acquiring Fund\nand other investment companies\nand companies controlled by them.\nHowever, registered investment\ncompanies are permitted to invest\nin the Fund beyond the limits set\nforth in Section 12(d)(1),\nsubject to certain terms and\nconditions set forth in SEC\nrules. In order for a registered\ninvestment company to invest in\nshares of the Fund beyond the\nlimitations of Section 12(d)(1)\nin reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under\nthe 1940 Act, the registered\ninvestment company must, among\nother things, enter into an\nagreement with the Trust. Foreign\ninvestment companies are\npermitted to invest in the Fund\nonly up to the limits set forth\nin Section 12(d)(1), subject to\nany applicable SEC no-action\nrelief. Book Entry. Shares of the\nFund are held in book-entry form,\nwhich means that no stock\ncertificates are issued. The\nDepository Trust Company ( \u201c DTC\n\u201d ) or its nominee is the record\nowner of, and holds legal title\nto, all outstanding shares of the\nFund. 20 Investors owning shares\nof the Fund are beneficial owners\nas shown on the records of DTC or\nits participants. DTC serves as\nthe securities depository for\nshares of the Fund. DTC\nparticipants include securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust\ncompanies, clearing corporations\nand other institutions that\ndirectly or indirectly maintain a\ncustodial relationship with DTC.\nAs a beneficial owner of shares,\nyou are not entitled to receive\nphysical delivery of stock\ncertificates or to have shares\nregistered in your name, and you\nare not considered a registered\nowner of shares. Therefore, to\nexercise any right as an owner of\nshares, you must rely upon the\nprocedures of DTC and its\nparticipants. These procedures\nare the same as those that apply\nto any other securities that you\nhold in book-entry or \u201c street\nname \u201d form. Share Prices. The\ntrading prices of the Fund\u2019s\nshares in the secondary market\ngenerally differ from the Fund\u2019s\ndaily NAV and are affected by\nmarket forces such as the supply\nof and demand for ETF shares and\nshares of underlying securities\nheld by the Fund, economic\nconditions and other factors.\nDetermination of Net Asset Value.\nThe NAV of the Fund normally is\ndetermined once daily Monday\nthrough Friday, generally as of\nthe close of regular trading\nhours of the New York Stock\nExchange ( \u201c NYSE \u201d ) (normally\n4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each\nday that the NYSE is open for\ntrading, based on prices at the\ntime of closing, provided that\nany Fund assets or liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars at\nthe prevailing market rates on\nthe date of valuation as quoted\nby one or more data service\nproviders. The NAV of the Fund is\ncalculated by dividing the value\nof the net assets of the Fund (\ni.e. , the value of its total\nassets less total liabilities) by\nthe total number of outstanding\nshares of the Fund, generally\nrounded to the nearest cent. The\nvalue of the securities and other\nassets and liabilities held by\nthe Fund is determined pursuant\nto BFA\u2019s valuation policies and\nprocedures. BFA has been\ndesignated by the Board as the\nvaluation designee for the Fund\npursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the\n1940 Act. Equity securities and\nother equity instruments for\nwhich market quotations are\nreadily available are valued at\nmarket value, which is generally\ndetermined using the last\nreported official closing price\nor, if a reported closing price\nis not available, the last traded\nprice on the exchange or market\non which the security or\ninstrument is primarily traded at\nthe time of valuation. Shares of\nunderlying open-end funds\n(including money market funds)\nare valued at net asset value.\nShares of underlying exchange-\ntraded closed-end funds or other\nETFs are valued at their most\nrecent closing price. Generally,\ntrading in non-U.S. securities\nand money market instruments is\nsubstantially completed each day\nat various times prior to the\nclose of regular trading hours of\nthe NYSE. The values of such\nsecurities used in computing the\nNAV of the Fund are determined as\nof such times. When market\nquotations are not readily\navailable or are believed by BFA\nto be unreliable, BFA will fair\nvalue the Fund\u2019s investments in\naccordance with its policies and\nprocedures. BFA may conclude that\na market quotation is not readily\navailable or is unreliable if a\nsecurity or other asset or\nliability does not have a price\nsource due to its 21 lack of\ntrading or other reasons, if a\nmarket quotation differs\nsignificantly from recent price\nquotations or otherwise no longer\nappears to reflect fair value,\nwhere the security or other asset\nor liability is thinly traded,\nwhen there is a significant event\nsubsequent to the most recent\nmarket quotation, or if the\ntrading market on which a\nsecurity is listed is suspended\nor closed and no appropriate\nalternative trading market is\navailable. A \u201c significant event\n\u201d is deemed to occur if BFA\ndetermines, in its reasonable\nbusiness judgment prior to or at\nthe time of pricing the Fund\u2019s\nassets or liabilities, that the\nevent is likely to cause a\nmaterial change to the last\nexchange closing price or closing\nmarket price of one or more\nassets held by, or liabilities\nof, the Fund. For certain foreign\nassets, a third-party vendor\nsupplies evaluated, systematic\nfair value pricing based upon the\nmovement of a proprietary multi-\nfactor model after the relevant\nforeign markets have closed. This\nsystematic fair value pricing\nmethodology is designed to\ncorrelate the prices of foreign\nassets in one or more non-U.S.\nmarkets following the close of\nthe local markets to the prices\nthat might have prevailed as of\nthe Fund\u2019s pricing time. Fair\nvalue represents a good faith\napproximation of the value of an\nasset or liability. The fair\nvalue of an asset or liability\nheld by the Fund is the amount\nthe Fund might reasonably expect\nto receive from the current sale\nof that asset or the cost to\nextinguish that liability in an\narm\u2019s-length transaction. Valuing\nthe Fund\u2019s investments using fair\nvalue pricing will result in\nprices that may differ from\ncurrent market valuations and\nthat may not be the prices at\nwhich those investments could\nhave been sold during the period\nin which the particular fair\nvalues were used. Use of fair\nvalue prices and certain current\nmarket valuations could result in\na difference between the prices\nused to calculate the Fund\u2019s NAV\nand the prices used by the\nUnderlying Index, which, in turn,\ncould result in a difference\nbetween the Fund\u2019s performance\nand the performance of the\nUnderlying Index. Dividends and\nDistributions. General Policies.\nDividends from net investment\nincome, if any, generally are\ndeclared and paid at least once a\nyear by the Fund. Distributions\nof net realized securities gains,\nif any, generally are declared\nand paid once a year, but the\nTrust may make distributions on a\nmore frequent basis for the Fund.\nThe Trust reserves the right to\ndeclare special distributions if,\nin its reasonable discretion,\nsuch action is necessary or\nadvisable to preserve its status\nas a regulated investment company\n( \u201c RIC \u201d ) or to avoid\nimposition of income or excise\ntaxes on undistributed income or\nrealized gains. Dividends and\nother distributions on shares of\nthe Fund are distributed on a pro\nrata basis to beneficial owners\nof such shares. Dividend payments\nare made through DTC participants\nand indirect participants to\nbeneficial owners then of record\nwith proceeds received from the\nFund. Dividend Reinvestment\nService. No dividend reinvestment\nservice is provided by the Trust.\nBroker-dealers may make available\nthe DTC book-entry Dividend\nReinvestment Service for use by\nbeneficial owners of the Fund for\nreinvestment of their dividend\ndistributions. Beneficial owners\nshould contact their broker to\ndetermine the availability and\ncosts of the service and the\ndetails of participation therein.\nBrokers may require beneficial\nowners to adhere to specific\nprocedures and timetables. If\nthis 22 service is available and\nused, dividend distributions of\nboth income and realized gains\nwill be automatically reinvested\nin additional whole shares of the\nFund purchased in the secondary\nmarket. Note on Tax Information.\nThe following sections summarize\nsome of the consequences under\ncurrent U.S. federal tax law of\nan investment in the Fund. It is\nnot a substitute for personal tax\nadvice. You may also be subject\nto state and local taxation on\nFund distributions and sales of\nshares. Certain states and\nlocalities may exempt from tax\ndistributions attributable to\ninterest from U.S. federal\ngovernment obligations. Consult\nyour personal tax advisor about\nthe potential tax consequences of\nan investment in shares of the\nFund under all applicable tax\nlaws. Taxes. As with any\ninvestment, you should consider\nhow your investment in shares of\nthe Fund will be taxed. The tax\ninformation in this Prospectus is\nprovided as general information,\nbased on current law. You should\nconsult your own tax professional\nabout the tax consequences of an\ninvestment in shares of the Fund.\nUnless your investment in Fund\nshares is made through a tax-\nexempt entity or tax-deferred\nretirement account, such as an\nIRA, in which case your\ndistributions generally will be\ntaxable when withdrawn, you need\nto be aware of the possible tax\nconsequences when the Fund makes\ndistributions or you sell Fund\nshares. Taxes on Distributions.\nDistributions from the Fund\u2019s net\ninvestment income (other than\nqualified dividend income),\nincluding distributions of income\nfrom securities lending and\ndistributions out of the Fund\u2019s\nnet short-term capital gains, if\nany, are taxable to you as\nordinary income. Distributions by\nthe Fund of net long-term capital\ngains, if any, in excess of net\nshort-term capital losses\n(capital gain dividends) are\ntaxable to you as long-term\ncapital gains, regardless of how\nlong you have held the Fund\u2019s\nshares. Distributions by the Fund\nthat qualify as qualified\ndividend income are taxable to\nyou at long-term capital gain\nrates. Long-term capital gains\nand qualified dividend income are\ngenerally eligible for taxation\nat a maximum rate of 15% or 20%\nfor non-corporate shareholders,\ndepending on whether their income\nexceeds certain threshold\namounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S.\nfederal Medicare contribution tax\nis imposed on \u201c net investment\nincome, \u201d including, but not\nlimited to, interest, dividends,\nand net gain, of U.S. individuals\nwith income exceeding $200,000\n(or $250,000 if married and\nfiling jointly) and of estates\nand trusts. Dividends will be\nqualified dividend income to you\nif they are attributable to\nqualified dividend income\nreceived by the Fund. Generally,\nqualified dividend income\nincludes dividend income from\ntaxable U.S. corporations and\nqualified non-U.S. corporations,\nprovided that the Fund satisfies\ncertain holding period\nrequirements in respect of the\nstock of such corporations and\nhas not hedged its position in\nthe stock in certain ways.\nSubstitute dividends received by\nthe Fund with respect to\ndividends paid on securities lent\nout will not be qualified\ndividend income. For this\npurpose, a qualified non-U.S.\ncorporation means any non-U.S.\ncorporation that is eligible for\nbenefits under a comprehensive\nincome tax treaty with the U.S.,\nwhich includes an exchange of\ninformation program, or if the\nstock with respect to which the\ndividend was paid is readily\ntradable on an established U.S.\nsecurities market. The term\nexcludes a corporation that is a\npassive foreign investment\ncompany. Dividends received by\nthe Fund from a RIC generally are\nqualified dividend income only to\nthe extent such dividend\ndistributions are made out of\nqualified dividend income\nreceived by such RIC.\nAdditionally, it is expected that\ndividends received by the Fund\nfrom a real estate investment\ntrust ( \u201c REIT \u201d ) and\ndistributed to a shareholder\ngenerally 23 will be taxable to\nthe shareholder as ordinary\nincome. However, for tax years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017\nand before January 1, 2026, the\nFund may report dividends\neligible for a 20% \u201c qualified\nbusiness income \u201d deduction for\nnon-corporate U.S. shareholders\nto the extent the Fund\u2019s income\nis derived from ordinary REIT\ndividends, reduced by allocable\nFund expenses. For a dividend to\nbe treated as qualified dividend\nincome, the dividend must be\nreceived with respect to a share\nof stock held without being\nhedged by the Fund, and with\nrespect to a share of the Fund\nheld without being hedged by you,\nfor 61 days during the 121-day\nperiod beginning at the date\nwhich is 60 days before the date\non which such share becomes ex-\ndividend with respect to such\ndividend or, in the case of\ncertain preferred stock, 91 days\nduring the 181-day period\nbeginning 90 days before such\ndate. Fund distributions, to the\nextent attributable to dividends\nfrom U.S. corporations, will be\neligible for the dividends\nreceived deduction for Fund\nshareholders that are\ncorporations, subject to certain\nhedging and holding requirements.\nIn general, your distributions\nare subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax for the year when they\nare paid. Certain distributions\npaid in January, however, may be\ntreated as paid on December 31 of\nthe prior year. If the Fund\u2019s\ndistributions exceed current and\naccumulated earnings and profits,\nall or a portion of the\ndistributions made in the taxable\nyear may be recharacterized as a\nreturn of capital to\nshareholders. Distributions in\nexcess of the Fund\u2019s minimum\ndistribution requirements, but\nnot in excess of the Fund\u2019s\nearnings and profits, will be\ntaxable to shareholders and will\nnot constitute nontaxable returns\nof capital. A return of capital\ndistribution generally will not\nbe taxable but will reduce the\nshareholder\u2019s cost basis and\nresult in a higher capital gain\nor lower capital loss when those\nshares on which the distribution\nwas received are sold. Once a\nshareholder's cost basis is\nreduced to zero, further\ndistributions will be treated as\ncapital gain, if the shareholder\nholds shares of the Fund as\ncapital assets. Dividends,\ninterest and capital gains earned\nby the Fund with respect to\nsecurities issued by non-U.S.\nissuers may give rise to\nwithholding, capital gains and\nother taxes imposed by non-U.S.\ncountries. Tax conventions\nbetween certain countries and the\nU.S. may reduce or eliminate such\ntaxes. If more than 50% of the\ntotal assets of the Fund at the\nclose of a year consists of\nnon-U.S. stocks or securities\n(generally, for this purpose,\ndepositary receipts, no matter\nwhere traded, of non-U.S.\ncompanies are treated as \u201c\nnon-U.S. \u201d ), generally the Fund\nmay \u201c pass through \u201d to you\ncertain non-U.S. income taxes\n(including withholding taxes)\npaid by the Fund. This means that\nyou would be considered to have\nreceived as an additional\ndividend your share of such\nnon-U.S. taxes, but you may be\nentitled to either a\ncorresponding tax deduction in\ncalculating your taxable income,\nor, subject to certain\nlimitations, a credit in\ncalculating your U.S. federal\nincome tax. For purposes of\nforeign tax credits for U.S.\nshareholders of the Fund, foreign\ncapital gains taxes may not\nproduce associated foreign source\nincome, limiting the availability\nof such credits for U.S. persons.\nIf you are neither a resident nor\na citizen of the U.S. or if you\nare a non-U.S. entity (other than\na pass-through entity to the\nextent owned by U.S. persons),\nthe Fund\u2019s ordinary income\ndividends (which include\ndistributions of net short-term\ncapital gains) will generally be\nsubject to a 30% U.S. withholding\ntax, unless a lower treaty rate\napplies, provided that\nwithholding tax will generally\nnot apply to any gain or income\n24 realized by a non-U.S.\nshareholder in respect of any\ndistributions of long-term\ncapital gains or upon the sale or\nother disposition of shares of\nthe Fund. Separately, a 30%\nwithholding tax is currently\nimposed on U.S.-source dividends,\ninterest and other income items\npaid to (i) foreign financial\ninstitutions, including non-U.S.\ninvestment funds, unless they\nagree to collect and disclose to\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Service\n( \u201c IRS \u201d ) information regarding\ntheir direct and indirect U.S.\naccount holders and (ii) certain\nother foreign entities, unless\nthey certify certain information\nregarding their direct and\nindirect U.S. owners. To avoid\nwithholding, foreign financial\ninstitutions will need to (i)\nenter into agreements with the\nIRS that state that they will\nprovide the IRS information,\nincluding the names, addresses\nand taxpayer identification\nnumbers of direct and indirect\nU.S. account holders, comply with\ndue diligence procedures with\nrespect to the identification of\nU.S. accounts, report to the IRS\ncertain information with respect\nto U.S. accounts maintained,\nagree to withhold tax on certain\npayments made to non-compliant\nforeign financial institutions or\nto account holders who fail to\nprovide the required information,\nand determine certain other\ninformation concerning their\naccount holders, or (ii) in the\nevent that an applicable\nintergovernmental agreement and\nimplementing legislation are\nadopted, provide local revenue\nauthorities with similar account\nholder information. Other foreign\nentities may need to report the\nname, address, and taxpayer\nidentification number of each\nsubstantial U.S. owner or provide\ncertifications of no substantial\nU.S. ownership unless certain\nexceptions apply. If your Fund\nshares are loaned out pursuant to\na securities lending arrangement,\nyou may lose the ability to treat\nFund dividends paid while the\nshares are held by the borrower\nas qualified dividend income. In\naddition, you may lose the\nability to use foreign tax\ncredits passed through by the\nFund if your Fund shares are\nloaned out pursuant to a\nsecurities lending agreement. If\nyou are a resident or a citizen\nof the U.S., by law, backup\nwithholding at a 24% rate will\napply to your distributions and\nproceeds if you have not provided\na taxpayer identification number\nor social security number and\nmade other required\ncertifications. Taxes When Shares\nAre Sold. Currently, any capital\ngain or loss realized upon a sale\nof Fund shares is generally\ntreated as a long-term gain or\nloss if the shares have been held\nfor more than one year. Any\ncapital gain or loss realized\nupon a sale of Fund shares held\nfor one year or less is generally\ntreated as short-term gain or\nloss, except that any capital\nloss on the sale of shares held\nfor six months or less is treated\nas long-term capital loss to the\nextent that capital gain\ndividends were paid with respect\nto such shares. Any such capital\ngains, including from sales of\nFund shares or from capital gain\ndividends, are included in \u201c net\ninvestment income \u201d for purposes\nof the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare\ncontribution tax mentioned above.\nCreations and Redemptions. Prior\nto trading in the secondary\nmarket, shares of the Fund are \u201c\ncreated \u201d at NAV by market\nmakers, large investors and\ninstitutions only in block-size\nCreation Units or multiples\nthereof. Each \u201c creator \u201d or\nauthorized participant (an \u201c\nAuthorized Participant \u201d ) has\nentered into an agreement with\nthe Fund's distributor, BlackRock\nInvestments, LLC (the \u201c\nDistributor \u201d or \u201c BRIL \u201d ), an\naffiliate of BFA. An Authorized\nParticipant is a member or\nparticipant of a clearing agency\nregistered with the SEC, which\nhas a written agreement with the\nFund or one of its service\nproviders that allows such member\nor participant to place orders\nfor the purchase and redemption\nof Creation Units. A creation\ntransaction, which is subject to\nacceptance by the Distributor and\nthe Fund, generally takes place\nwhen an Authorized Participant\ndeposits into the Fund a 25\ndesignated portfolio of\nsecurities, assets or other\npositions (a \u201c creation basket \u201d\n), and an amount of cash\n(including any cash representing\nthe value of substituted\nsecurities, assets or other\npositions), if any, which\ntogether approximate the holdings\nof the Fund in exchange for a\nspecified number of Creation\nUnits. Similarly, shares can be\nredeemed only in Creation Units,\ngenerally for a designated\nportfolio of securities, assets\nor other positions (a \u201c\nredemption basket \u201d ) held by the\nFund and an amount of cash\n(including any portion of such\nsecurities for which cash may be\nsubstituted). The Fund generally\noffers Creation Units partially\nfor cash, but may, in certain\ncircumstances, offer Creation\nUnits solely for cash or solely\nin-kind. Except when aggregated\nin Creation Units, shares are not\nredeemable by the Fund. Creation\nand redemption baskets may differ\nand the Fund may accept \u201c custom\nbaskets. \u201d More information\nregarding custom baskets is\ncontained in the Fund's SAI. The\nprices at which creations and\nredemptions occur are based on\nthe next calculation of NAV after\na creation or redemption order is\nreceived in an acceptable form\nunder the authorized participant\nagreement. Only an Authorized\nParticipant may create or redeem\nCreation Units with the Fund.\nAuthorized Participants may\ncreate or redeem Creation Units\nfor their own accounts or for\ncustomers, including, without\nlimitation, affiliates of the\nFund. In the event of a system\nfailure or other interruption,\nincluding disruptions at market\nmakers or Authorized\nParticipants, orders to purchase\nor redeem Creation Units either\nmay not be executed according to\nthe Fund's instructions or may\nnot be executed at all, or the\nFund may not be able to place or\nchange orders. To the extent the\nFund engages in in-kind\ntransactions, the Fund intends to\ncomply with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws in accepting\nsecurities for deposit and\nsatisfying redemptions with\nredemption securities by, among\nother means, assuring that any\nsecurities accepted for deposit\nand any securities used to\nsatisfy redemption requests will\nbe sold in transactions that\nwould be exempt from registration\nunder the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended (the \u201c 1933 Act \u201d ).\nFurther, an Authorized\nParticipant that is not a \u201c\nqualified institutional buyer, \u201d\nas such term is defined in Rule\n144A under the 1933 Act, will not\nbe able to receive restricted\nsecurities eligible for resale\nunder Rule 144A. Creations and\nredemptions must be made through\na firm that is either a member of\nthe Continuous Net Settlement\nSystem of the National Securities\nClearing Corporation or a DTC\nparticipant that has executed an\nagreement with the Distributor\nwith respect to creations and\nredemptions of Creation Unit\naggregations. Information about\nthe procedures regarding creation\nand redemption of Creation Units\n(including the cut-off times for\nreceipt of creation and\nredemption orders) is included in\nthe Fund's SAI. Because new\nshares may be created and issued\non an ongoing basis, at any point\nduring the life of the Fund a \u201c\ndistribution, \u201d as such term is\nused in the 1933 Act, may be\noccurring. Broker-dealers and\nother persons are cautioned that\nsome activities on their part\nmay, depending on the\ncircumstances, result in their\nbeing deemed participants in a\ndistribution in a manner that\ncould render them statutory\nunderwriters subject to the\nprospectus delivery and liability\nprovisions of the 1933 Act. Any\ndetermination of whether one is\nan underwriter must take into\naccount all the relevant facts\nand circumstances of each\nparticular case. Broker-dealers\nshould also note that dealers who\nare not \u201c underwriters \u201d but are\nparticipating in a distribution\n(as contrasted to ordinary\nsecondary transactions), and thus\ndealing with shares that are part\nof an \u201c unsold allotment \u201d within\nthe meaning of 26 Section\n4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would\nbe unable to take advantage of\nthe prospectus delivery exemption\nprovided by Section 4(a)(3) of\nthe 1933 Act. For delivery of\nprospectuses to exchange members,\nthe prospectus delivery mechanism\nof Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is\navailable only with respect to\ntransactions on a national\nsecurities exchange.\nHouseholding. Householding is an\noption available to certain Fund\ninvestors. Householding is a\nmethod of delivery, based on the\npreference of the individual\ninvestor, in which a single copy\nof certain shareholder documents\ncan be delivered to investors who\nshare the same address, even if\ntheir accounts are registered\nunder different names. Please\ncontact your broker-dealer if you\nare interested in enrolling in\nhouseholding and receiving a\nsingle copy of prospectuses and\nother shareholder documents, or\nif you are currently enrolled in\nhouseholding and wish to change\nyour householding status. 27\nDistribution The Distributor or\nits agent distributes Creation\nUnits for the Fund on an agency\nbasis. The Distributor does not\nmaintain a secondary market in\nshares of the Fund. The\nDistributor has no role in\ndetermining the policies of the\nFund or the securities that are\npurchased or sold by the Fund.\nThe Distributor\u2019s principal\naddress is 50 Hudson Yards, New\nYork, NY 10001. BFA or its\naffiliates make payments to\nbroker-dealers, registered\ninvestment advisers, banks or\nother intermediaries (together, \u201c\nintermediaries \u201d ) related to\nmarketing activities and\npresentations, educational\ntraining programs, conferences,\nthe development of technology\nplatforms and reporting systems,\ndata provision services, or their\nmaking shares of the Fund and\ncertain other iShares funds\navailable to their customers\ngenerally and in certain\ninvestment programs. Such\npayments, which may be\nsignificant to the intermediary,\nare not made by the Fund. Rather,\nsuch payments are made by BFA or\nits affiliates from their own\nresources, which come directly or\nindirectly in part from fees paid\nby the iShares funds complex.\nPayments of this type are\nsometimes referred to as revenue-\nsharing payments. A financial\nintermediary may make decisions\nabout which investment options it\nrecommends or makes available, or\nthe level of services provided,\nto its customers based on the\npayments or other financial\nincentives it is eligible to\nreceive. Therefore, such payments\nor other financial incentives\noffered or made to an\nintermediary create conflicts of\ninterest between the intermediary\nand its customers and may cause\nthe intermediary to recommend the\nFund or other iShares funds over\nanother investment. More\ninformation regarding these\npayments is contained in the\nFund's SAI. Please contact your\nsalesperson or other investment\nprofessional for more information\nregarding any such payments his\nor her firm may receive from BFA\nor its affiliates. Financial\nHighlights The financial\nhighlights table is intended to\nhelp investors understand the\nFund\u2019s financial performance for\nthe past five years. Certain\ninformation reflects financial\nresults for a single share of the\nFund. The total returns in the\ntable represent the rate that an\ninvestor would have earned (or\nlost) on an investment in the\nFund, assuming reinvestment of\nall dividends and distributions.\nThis
